https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/25/why-intempus-thinks-robots-should-have-a-human-physiological-state/,Why Intempus thinks robots should have a human physiological state,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Teddy Warner, 19, has always been interested in robotics. His family was in the industry, and he says he “grew up” working in a machinist shop while in high school. Now Warner is building a robotics company of his own, Intempus, that looks to make robots a bit more human. Intempus is building tech to retrofit existing robots with human-like emotional expressions to help humans better interact with these machines and better predict their movements. Giving these robots human-like reactions will also produce data that can be used to better train AI models. These robots will show expression through kinetic movements, Warner told TechCrunch. “Humans derive a lot of our subconscious signals, not from face, not from semantics, but solely from the movement of your arms and your torso,” Warner said. “This extends to dogs and cats and other animals that aren’t humans.” Warner said he got the idea for Intempus while he was working at AI research lab Midjourney . He said Midjourney, like many other AI research labs, was working on world AI models , or AI models that understand and make decisions based on the dynamics of the real world and spatial properties, as opposed to just cause and effect. But it will be really hard for these models to achieve this spatial reasoning, Warner realized, because a lot of the data the models were being trained on came from robots that didn’t have this spatial reasoning, either. “Robots currently go from A to C, that is observation to action, whereas humans, and all living things, have this intermediary B step that we call physiological state,” Warner said. “Robots don’t have physiological state. They don’t have fun, they don’t have stress. If we want robots to understand the world like a human can, and be able to communicate with humans in a way that is innate to us, that is less uncanny, more predictable, we have to give them this B step.” Warner took that idea and started to research. He started with fMRI data, which measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow and oxygen, but it didn’t work. Then his friend suggested trying a polygraph (lie detector test), which works by capturing sweat data, and he started to find some success. “I was shocked at how quickly I could go from capturing sweat data for myself and a few of my friends and then training this model that can essentially allow robots to have an emotional composition solely based on sweat data,” Warner said. He’s since expanded from sweat data into other areas, like body temperature, heart rate, and photoplethysmography, which measures the blood volume changes in the microvascular level of the skin, among others. Warner launched Intempus in September 2024 and spent the first four months exclusively on research. He’s spent the last few on a mix of building up these emotional capabilities for robots and engaging potential customers. He’s already signed seven enterprise robotics partners. Intempus is also part of the current cohort of Peter Thiel’s Thiel Fellowship program , which gives young entrepreneurs $200,000 over two years to drop out of school and build their companies. Warner said the next step for Intempus is to hire — he’s done everything until now as a team of one — and get some of the tech that’s already been built in front of humans to start testing. While Intempus is currently working on retrofitting existing robots and plans to focus on that, Warner said he’d never rule out Intempus building its own emotionally intelligent robots in the future. “I have a bunch of robots, and they run a bunch of emotions, and I want to have someone come in and just understand that this robot is a joyful robot, and if I can innately convey some emotion, some intents that the robot holds, then I’ve done my job properly,” Warner said. “I think I can, you know, really prove that I’ve done this over the next four to six months.” Topics Senior Reporter, Venture LIMITED TIME: Save $300+ on your ticket, plus an additional 50% on a second for a full immersive day of AI!

https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/23/kesha-is-now-a-startup-founder/,Kesha is now a startup founder,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Kesha may have taken the dollar sign out of her name, but now, the singer is thinking about money again — not for herself, but to fund the seed round of her new startup, Smash . According to Kesha’s Instagram post , Smash will be a “community-based platform to connect and protect music creators,” which aligns with the mission of her new eponymous record label , which she announced last year. The 38-year-old chart-topper has always been more than a glitter-clad party girl singing about brushing her teeth with Jack Daniel’s . Beneath her infectious 2010s pop music is a darker story — one in which she felt stripped of her power , both as an artist and a person, by a predatory record deal that she signed when she was a teenager. After a traumatic public legal battle with her producer, Kesha now says that she is a “free woman,” and she’s making new music. Both her label, Kesha Records, and the app Smash seek to help others make music without compromising their creative rights. “I want a place where artists and music makers of any kind can have community, they can collaborate, they can hire each other and retain all the rights to everything they create,” Kesha said in an interview with WIRED. “There’s no gatekeeping of contacts.” She went on to describe the app as “LinkedIn for music creators,” or a “Fiverr-style marketplace.” The difference is that Smash plans to prioritize artists’ rights at every stage. Kesha’s CTO on the project is Alan Cannistraro. He spent 12 years at Apple building some of the first iOS apps, then worked at Facebook, where he built the Year-In-Review feature. He left to start a social video platform called Rheo , which TechCrunch covered in 2016.

https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/28/litehaus-raises-e1-7-million-pre-seed-to-build-home-building-marketplace/,Litehaus raises €1.46M pre-seed to build home-building platform,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us All Thibault Launay and his wife, Simi, wanted nearly five years ago was to build a dream home in Portugal, where they both now live. But what they encountered instead was a broken system. “Fourteen months of delays, 20% budget overruns, and endless stress managing over 10 subcontractors,” Thibault recalled. They bought the land in December 2020, got the construction license in early 2022, and started building that year. “That was supposed to finish in February 2024,” he said. But it’s May 2025, and the home still isn’t done. “We realized,” he continued, “if we’re struggling with this, so are millions of others.” So Thibault, himself a serial founder and entrepreneur, and Simi, a consultant and also a founder, launched Litehaus , a company that touts to help landowners and property developers build homes in a more efficient and sustainable way. It tackles a pressing need in both the U.S. and the European markets: the ability to build affordable homes. Litehaus, which launched early last year, calls itself the “Uber of construction,” with Thibault saying the company just wants to connect all the currently fragmented parts of the home-building process. It matches landowners and property developers with other professionals such as construction companies, architects, contractors, and interior designers. The company allows users to track costs, coordinate schedules with the hired workers, and track the progress of the building in real time. “As a go-to-market strategy, we decided to focus mainly on modular construction, allowing us to build 30% cheaper, 40% faster, and 60% more sustainably,” Thibault said, adding that meant 90% less waste and 50% less CO2 emissions compared with traditional construction. Others in the modular construction space include the U.S.-based Ginosko Modular and Flummerfelt and the India-based Schnelle Prefabs, according to PitchBook. Litehaus has at least one U.S. construction company in its network as it looks to further its expansion in the country. Right now, it is focused on becoming “Europe’s fastest-growing construction tech startup,” Thibault said. Plus, the European construction industry could use more innovation. Investors in America pour billions of dollars into rising construction technology, and, as usual, there is much room for the European tech industry to catch up. Investors here and across the pond clearly agree. Last week, Litehaus announced a €1.46 million pre-seed round, co-led by the U.K.’s Cornerstone VC and Explorer Fund, one of Portugal’s largest private equity funds. Claster Group, a Luxembourgish family office, and angel investor Pascal Levy, a venture partner at Long Journey Ventures here in the U.S., also participated in the round. “The shortage of housing across Europe has triggered a crisis, driving up the cost of living as home ownership becomes increasingly out of reach,” Rodney Appiah, a managing partner at Cornerstone VC, said. “When I first met Thibault and Simi, I was struck by their compelling vision: to make building a home as simple as buying one, catalyzing the construction industry to bring greater transparency, sustainability, quality, and trust to the home-building process.” Thibault called the fundraising journey “intense.” He said he and Simi had known their lead investors for years through mutual friends. Thibault, who is from France, is the founder of an immersive gaming studio in Portugal, but he has also invested in numerous companies, both as an angel investor and through his work at firms 50 Partners and Origins, based in France and New York, respectively. Before that, he worked at a French mining company and in green tech. Simi, meanwhile, was born in Nigeria and grew up in London. She ran a contemporary art gallery, a wellness brand for women of color, and worked as a consultant and strategist for various firms on law and Africa. “I’ve always wanted to build businesses that change people’s lives,” Simi told TechCrunch. “Providing affordable homes at scale isn’t just a market opportunity — it’s one of the most meaningful ways we can create deep, lasting impact.” She is now in charge of marketing, communication, and design at Litehaus, while Thibault handles fundraising, business development, and tech. “When it came time to raise, we moved quickly with partners who already knew us and shared our vision from day one,” Thibault said. He said the fresh capital will be used to help scale the company and hire more talent in engineering, product, marketing, and operations. It’s quite funny that Thibault and Simi built a company, raised over a million euros, and had two kids, before their home, a process they started working on over four years ago, was finally finished. “We are actually moving in next month,” Thibault said. “We move in next month after a 14-month delay on completion. This is the pain point we are trying to solve for millions of people.” This story was updated to reflect who co-led the round.

https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/23/what-is-mistral-ai-everything-to-know-about-the-openai-competitor/,What is Mistral AI? Everything to know about the OpenAI competitor,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Mistral AI, the French company behind AI assistant Le Chat and several foundational models, is officially regarded as one of France’s most promising tech startups and is arguably the only European company that could compete with OpenAI . But compared to its $6 billion valuation, its global market share is still relatively low. However, the recent launch of its chat assistant on mobile app stores was met with some hype, particularly in its home country. “Go and download Le Chat, which is made by Mistral, rather than ChatGPT by OpenAI — or something else,” French president Emmanuel Macron said in a TV interview ahead of the AI Action Summit in Paris. While this wave of attention may be encouraging, Mistral AI still faces challenges in competing with the likes of OpenAI — and in doing so while keeping up with its self-definition as “the world’s greenest and leading independent AI lab.” Mistral AI has raised significant amounts of funding since its creation in 2023 with the ambition to “put frontier AI in the hands of everyone.” While this isn’t a direct jab at OpenAI, the slogan is meant to highlight the company’s advocacy for openness in AI. Its alternative to ChatGPT, chat assistant Le Chat, is now also available on iOS and Android . It reached 1 million downloads in the two weeks following its mobile release, even grabbing France’s top spot for free downloads on the iOS App Store. This comes in addition to Mistral AI’s suite of models, which includes: In March 2025, the company introduced Mistral OCR , an optical character recognition (OCR) API that can turn any PDF into a text file to make it easier for AI models to ingest. Mistral AI’s three founders share a background in AI research at major U.S. tech companies with significant operations in Paris. CEO Arthur Mensch used to work at Google’s DeepMind, while CTO Timothée Lacroix and chief scientist officer Guillaume Lample are former Meta staffers. Co-founding advisers also include Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve (also a board member) and Charles Gorintin from health insurance startup Alan, as well as former digital minister Cédric O, which caused controversy due to his previous role. Not all of them . Mistral AI differentiates its premier models, whose weights are not available for commercial purposes, from its free models, for which it provides weight access under the Apache 2.0 license. Free models include research models such as Mistral NeMo, which was built in collaboration with Nvidia that the startup open sourced in July 2024. While many of Mistral AI’s offerings are free or now have free tiers , Mistral AI plans to drive some revenue from Le Chat’s paid tiers. Introduced in February 2025, Le Chat’s Pro plan is priced at $14.99 a month. On the purely B2B side, Mistral AI monetizes its premier models through APIs with usage-based pricing. Enterprises can also license these models, and the company likely also generates a significant share of its revenue from its strategic partnerships, some of which it highlighted during the Paris AI Summit . Overall, however, Mistral AI’s revenue is reportedly still in the eight-digit range, according to multiple sources. In 2024, Mistral AI entered a deal with Microsoft that included a strategic partnership for distributing its AI models through Microsoft’s Azure platform and a €15 million investment. The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) swiftly concluded that the deal didn’t qualify for investigation due to its small size. However, it also sparked some criticism in the EU. In January 2025, Mistral AI signed a deal with press agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) to let Chat query the AFP’s entire text archive dating back to 1983. Mistral AI also secured strategic partnerships with France’s army and job agency , shipping giant CMA , German defense tech startup Helsing IBM Orange , and Stellantis In May 2025, Mistral AI announced it would participate in the creation of an AI Campus in the Paris region , as part of a joint venture with UAE-investment firm MGX, NVIDIA, and France’s state-owned investment bank Bpifrance As of February 2025, Mistral AI raised around €1 billion in capital to date, approximately $1.04 billion at the current exchange rate. This includes some debt financing, as well as several equity financing rounds raised in close succession. In June 2023, and before it even released its first models, Mistral AI raised a record $112 million seed round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. Sources at the time said the seed round — Europe’s largest ever — valued the then-one-month-old startup at $260 million. Other investors in this seed round included Bpifrance, Eric Schmidt, Exor Ventures, First Minute Capital, Headline, JCDecaux Holding, La Famiglia, LocalGlobe, Motier Ventures, Rodolphe Saadé, Sofina, and Xavier Niel. Only six months later, it closed a Series A of €385 million ($415 million at the time), at a reported valuation of $2 billion. The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), with participation from existing backer Lightspeed, as well as BNP Paribas, CMA-CGM, Conviction, Elad Gil, General Catalyst, and Salesforce. The $16.3 million convertible investment that Microsoft made in Mistral AI as part of their partnership announced in February 2024 was presented as a Series A extension, implying an unchanged valuation. In June 2024, Mistral AI then raised €600 million in a mix of equity and debt (around $640 million at the exchange rate at the time). The long-rumored round was led by General Catalyst at a $6 billion valuation, with notable investors, including Cisco, IBM, Nvidia, Samsung Venture Investment Corporation, and others. Mistral is “not for sale,” Mensch said in January 2025 at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “Of course, [an IPO is] the plan.” This makes sense, given how much the startup has raised so far: Even a large sale may not provide high enough multiples for its investors, not to mention sovereignty concerns depending on the acquirer. However, the only way to definitely squash persistent acquisition rumors is to scale its revenue to levels that could even remotely justify its nearly $6 billion valuation. Either way, stay tuned.

https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/22/manychat-taps-140m-to-boost-its-business-messaging-platform-with-ai/,Manychat taps $140M to boost its business messaging platform with AI,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Chatbots and other kinds of AI agents may feel like a dime a dozen these days. But the truth is that, for both businesses and consumers, some may be infinitely more useful (and perhaps less dystopian ) than others. Today, a startup that’s built a successful business around that concept is announcing a major growth round to expand its business. Manychat , which provides a tool for managing and automating conversations and engagement across multiple messaging channels, has picked up $140 million in a Series B round led by Summit Partners. The funding is coming on the heels of strong growth for the startup. Manychat today has around 1.5 million customers across 170 countries, with its client list including the likes of Nike, the New York Times, and Yahoo, as well as individual creators and much smaller outfits. Manychat’s CEO and co-founder, Mike Yan, said the company sends “billions” of messages annually on behalf of these users across TikTok, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and other chat platforms. The plan is to use the fresh cash both to invest in R&D — in particular, to bring more AI to the platform — and boost the company’s sales, marketing, and support globally. Notably for a startup these days, Manychat is mostly profitable — as Yan describes it, the company “always operates on the edge of being kind of break even.” Since launching in 2015, the startup had only raised around $23 million until now, mostly from an $18 million Series A round in 2019. Manychat did not disclose who the other investors are in this Series B round beyond Summit. The company is not giving out a valuation, either, but it’s likely to be considerably higher than the modest $58 million post-money price tag PitchBook detailed for the Series A. Manychat’s trajectory mirrors both the rise of smartphone-based messaging apps over the last decade and the growing opportunity around tools that help businesses leverage that medium in a better way. In 2015, the email inbox was starting to tip into becoming a spam-laden, tired, and overused medium for businesses looking to use it for marketing. Yan at the time was fresh off the back of a failed social app, and he himself was a Telegram user, one of a growing population of consumers using messaging apps for basic communications. When Telegram opened up its APIs, the lightbulb of inspiration went off for him and his co-founder Anton Gorin. “Telegram was actually one of the first western messaging apps to open up its APIs,” he recalled. “As users of Telegram ourselves, we saw a clear job to be done.” Companies were using email to connect to users, he said, but that was not where users were spending time. “They should be using messaging apps actually to connect with customers; that’s where the new wave of communication is happening. That’s where the new consumer is.” So he and Gorin built the first iteration of Manychat as a tool for creating chats for businesses on Telegram. It picked up enough traction to get them into the 500 Startups accelerator. Things started to take off when Facebook opened up its APIs for Messenger. By the time Manychat raised its Series A in 2019, it was already reaching 350 million users on the platform monthly, with billions of messages and an enviable open rate of 80%. Additional APIs opening up across other Meta-owned platforms as well as TikTok have boosted that growth. Users can still market on Telegram, too, Yan said, although these days that is just a small percentage of its traffic. Instagram is by far the most engaged and active platform for the company today, Yan said. Manychat’s founding and a large chunk of its growth preceded the rise of generative AI and the emergence of AI chatbots like Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and Google’s Gemini. In fact, earlier descriptions of Manychat touted how it provided a “smart blend of automation and personal outreach” to customers, who were using its no-code platform to build chatbots to grow social followers, collect email addresses, respond to comments, and set up flows via DM links to request products or more information. Anchoring its product around encouraging further actions, Yan said, is what sets his company apart from most chatbots on the market right now, including most generative AI chatbots. Sophia Popova, the Summit partner who led the investment (and is joining the board of the startup), believes that Manychat’s approach of building an engagement layer makes it a solid bet for the next wave of activity on messaging platforms. “Our thesis hinges on a greater proportion of commerce dollars going through social messaging apps,” she said in an interview. “You need to be always on and engaging 24/7. That is what customers expect, and Manychat is hitting the nail on the head.” In contrast, she said, when considering the DNA of the AI chatbots, “very few of them are geared towards personalizing conversation in a way that drives conversion to revenue.” If you want a help desk chatbot, there are myriad tools out there, but very few that are engaging to sell or elicit other responses from users in the way that Manychat has done, she added. Yet, given the pace of development — and AI startups’ motivation to generate revenue to offset huge cash burn — this gap may not be present for long. That’s one reason Manychat is working to build in more AI features to improve its offering.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/constellation-technologies-operations-wants-to-work-with-telecom-operators-to-deliver-5g-internet-from-space/,Constellation Technologies & Operations wants to work with telecom operators to deliver 5G internet from space,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The telecom industry is undergoing its greatest period of disruption since the telegraph, as companies work to open up space as the next frontier for communications. French startup Constellation hopes to take part by repurposing 5G tech to provide a Starlink-like satellite broadband that uses telecoms’ existing assets. Constellation Technologies & Operations , to call it by its full name, plans to launch a constellation of satellites in very low Earth orbit and work directly with telecom operators to provide high-speed internet access via small (but stationary) user terminals. The company would do this by repurposing terrestrial 5G spectrum for space-based connectivity — cellular signals can actually reach to and from orbit if handled right. Constellation would provide the capacity and terminals but the customer would pay the telecom company for the service, with that subscription revenue shared. Constellation founder and CEO Charles Delfieux acknowledged in a recent interview that the space sector is at a turning point: “For the first time in the history of space and telecommunication, we are basically witnessing a convergence between space and terrestrial connectivity in terms of performance and price,” he said. “That convergence is basically making those sought-after, cost-effective solutions to deliver connectivity as something that is completely achievable.” An engineer by training, Delfieux spent the majority of his career working at the World Bank, where he acted as program manager leading the structuring and financing of large infrastructure projects in emerging countries. He witnessed firsthand how access to reliable internet remains a challenge for millions of people. With the support of a first investor, he resigned from the World Bank and founded Constellation in 2022. “If you want to really achieve ubiquitous, universal connectivity, the only way to do that is to leverage space technologies,” he said. He acknowledged that the most successful example to date is Starlink, whose performance and price is getting closer and closer to what terrestrial solutions provide. But Delfieux said the Constellation team eventually realized that the most promising business plan is to essentially work with, not against, terrestrial telecom operators. By doing so, he sees massive opportunity to provide universal internet access regardless of location or existing connectivity. The plan is bolstered by some technological innovations, namely the development of a satellite form factor that will be capable of operating in very low Earth orbit, around 375 kilometers, which Delfieux says will help boost the performance of the system. Constellation also aims to repurpose part of the 5G spectrum allocated to the telecom operators on the ground for its space communications service. By doing so, Delfieux said the startup will help telecoms to monetize the full extent of their 5G networks — and more meaningfully compete with new entrants like SpaceX and Amazon’s Kuiper. “Established national, regional, traditional telecom operators, they are seeing these very powerful, very influential players, new entrants in telecommunications sector, that start operating a broadband constellation, that start delivering broadband services from space…they are more and more aiming at taking their own space within the telecommunication sector, in direct competition with established national and regional telecom operators. So it’s a threat. We basically want to be the ones providing a telco-friendly solution for the telecom operator. So tomorrow they can compete with those new entrants.” By using 5G spectrum, Constellation can also integrate within the design of its user terminals and satellite payloads mass-produced, cheap components that are already being produced for terrestrial communication networks in order to drive down costs, he added. The company has secured a €9.3 million ($10.2 million) seed round to accelerate its plans. The new funding comes from Expansion Ventures, Bpifrance and a previous unnamed investor. Constellation estimates that its business model will need a constellation of 1,500 satellites to provide global coverage — an ambitious number by any measure — with performance rates of 150 Mbps downlink and 50 Mbps uplink and a latency of less than 30 milliseconds. The company plans first on launching a hosted payload to orbit by June 2025 to carry out an end-to-end test of the service. From there, it will launch two prototype satellites by the end of 2026 with the aim of deploying production satellites the following year.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/11/edps-microsoft-365/,EU’s use of Microsoft 365 found to breach data protection rules,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A lengthy investigation into the European Union’s use of Microsoft 365 has found the Commission breached the bloc’s data protection rules through its use of the cloud-based productivity software. Announcing its decision in a press release today, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) said the Commission infringed “several key data protection rules when using Microsoft 365”. “The Commission did not sufficiently specify what types of personal data are to be collected and for which explicit and specified purposes when using Microsoft 365,” the data supervisor, Wojciech Wiewiórowski, wrote, adding: “The Commission’s infringements as data controller also relate to data processing, including transfers of personal data, carried out on its behalf.” The EDPS has imposed corrective measures requiring the Commission to address the compliance problems it has identified by December 9 2024, assuming it continues to use Microsoft’s cloud suite. Microsoft and the Commission were contacted for a response to the EDPS’ findings. But at the time of writing neither had responded. The regulator, which oversees’ EU institutions’ compliance with data protection rules, opened a probe of the Commission’s use of Microsoft 365 and other U.S. cloud services back in May 2021 . At issue is how Microsoft processes the data of users of its cloud service. EU regulators have been flagging concerns about this for years , including in relation to the legal basis Microsoft claims for processing data; a lack of clarity and precision in the wording of its contracts for the product; and no technical safeguards being applied to ensure data is only being used for providing and maintaining the service. When the EDPS opened the investigation there was also no data transfer agreement in place between the bloc and the U.S., following the striking down of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield in July 2020 A new transatlantic data transfer agreement was subsequently agreed and adopted, thee years later ( July 2023 ). But for much of the period the EDPS was investigating the Commission’s use of Microsoft 365 there was no deal in place covering data transfers from the EU to the U.S. Yet use of Microsoft 365 routinely results in data flowing back to Microsoft’s servers in the U.S. On data transfers, the EDPS found the Commission failed to ensure adequate safeguards were applied to these data exports to ensure essentially equivalent protections for data were in place once it left the bloc. The data supervisor has ordered the Commission to suspend all data flows resulting from its use of Microsoft 365 to Microsoft and its affiliates and sub-processors located in countries outside the EU/EEA not covered by an EU adequacy decision on data transfers — again, with a deadline of December 9 for this. It has also been ordered to carry out a data transfer-mapping exercise — identifying “what personal data are transferred to which recipients in which third countries, for which purposes and subject to which safeguards, including an onward transfers”. It must also ensure all transfers to non-EU countries without an adequacy decision take place “solely to allow tasks within the competence of the controller to be carried out”. More broadly, the EDPS’ corrective measures require the Commission to fix its contracts with Microsoft — to ensure they contain the necessary contractual provisions, organizational measures and/or technical measures to ensure personal data is only collected for explicit and specified purposes; and “sufficiently determined” in relation to the purposes for which they are processed. Data must also only be processed by Microsoft or its affiliates or sub-processors “on the Commission’s documented instructions”, per the order — unless it takes place within the region and processing is for a purpose that complies with EU or Member State law; or, if outside the region to be processed for another purpose under third-country law there must be essentially equivalent protection applied. The contracts must also ensure there is no further processing of data — i.e. uses beyond the original purpose for which data is collected. The EDPS found the Commission infringed the “purpose limitation” principle of applicable data protection rules by failing to sufficiently determine the types of personal data collected under the licensing agreement it concluded with Microsoft Ireland, meaning it was unable to ensure these were specific and explicit. The EU also failed to provide sufficiently clear documented instructions to Microsoft regarding the processing; failed to ensure its processing was limited by instruction; and failed to assess the compliance of Microsoft’s further processing with the purpose initially stated for the collection, among other violations of the rules the EDPS identified. It is the responsibility of the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies (EUIs) to ensure that any processing of personal data outside and inside the EU/EEA, including in the context of cloud-based services, is accompanied by robust data protection safeguards and measures. This is imperative to ensure that individuals’ information is protected, as required by Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, whenever their data is processed by, or on behalf of, an EUI. Over the last few years, Microsoft has responded to amped up EU regulatory risk attached to data transfers by expanding a data localization effort focused on regional cloud customers — in an infrastructure it’s branded the “ EU Data Boundary for the Microsoft Cloud ”. However the technical infrastructure is still in the process of being rolled out. It also remains porous by design, with some data set to remaining accessible outside the EU even when the rollout is slated to be completed at the end of this year, per Microsoft. Update: The Commission confirmed receipt of the EDPB’s decision and said it will need to analyze the reasoning “in detail” before taking any decision on how to proceed. In a series of statements during a press briefing , it expressed confidence that it complies with “the applicable data protection rules, both in fact and in law”. It also said “various improvements” have been made to contracts, with the EDPS, during its investigation. “We have been cooperating fully with the EDPS since the start of the investigation, by providing all relevant documents and information to the EDPS and by following up on the issues that have been raised in the course of the investigation,” it said. “The Commission has always been ready to implement, and grateful for receiving, any substantiated recommendation from the EDPS. Data protection is a top priority for the Commission.” “The Commission has always been fully committed to ensuring that its use of Microsoft M365 is compliant with the applicable data protection rules and will continue to do so. The same applies to all other software acquired by the Commission,” it went on, further noting: “New data protection rules for the EU institutions and bodies came into force on 11 December 2018. The Commission is actively pursuing ambitious and safe adequacy frameworks with international partners. The Commission applies those rules in all its processes and contracts, including with individual companies such as Microsoft.” While the Commission’s public statements reiterated that it’s committed to compliance with its legal obligations, it also claimed that “compliance with the EDPS decision unfortunately seems likely to undermine the current high level of mobile and integrated IT services”. “This applies not only to Microsoft but potentially also to other commercial IT services. But we need to first analyse the decision’s conclusions and the underlying reasons in detail. We cannot provide further comments until we have concluded the analysis,” it added.

https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/meta-coo-sheryl-sandberg-sanctioned-by-judge-for-allegedly-deleting-emails/,Former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg sanctioned by judge for allegedly deleting emails,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A Delaware judge has sanctioned Sheryl Sandberg, Meta’s former COO and board member, for allegedly deleting emails related to the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal . The decision arises from a case Meta shareholders brought against Sandberg and another former Meta board member, Jeff Zients, late last year. The plaintiffs alleged that Sandberg and Zients used personal email accounts to communicate about issues relating to a 2018 shareholder lawsuit that accused Facebook leaders of violating the law — and their fiduciary duties — in failing to protect users’ privacy. Plaintiffs also alleged that Sandberg and Zients deleted emails from their personal inboxes despite being instructed not to do so by a court. In a decision Tuesday, the Delaware judge overseeing the case found the accusations to be convincing. “The defendants disclosed Sandberg’s personal Gmail account, maintained under a pseudonym, that she used to ‘communicate about matters potentially relevant to the claims and defenses in this action,’” the judge’s decision reads . “Counsel’s failure to give a straight answer in Sandberg’s interrogatory responses or when answering plaintiffs’ questions supports an inference that Sandberg was not using an auto-delete function but rather picking and choosing which emails to delete.” In sanctioning Sandberg, the judge raised the legal standard for Sandberg’s affirmative defense, the defense based on facts other than those in support of the plaintiff’s claim. Now Sandberg must prove her defense by “clear and convincing” evidence — not merely a “preponderance” of evidence, a burden that’s easier to clear. The judge has also awarded plaintiffs certain expenses. In a statement to TechCrunch via email, a spokesperson for Sandberg said that the plaintiffs’ claims “have no merit.” “All work emails were preserved on Facebook’s servers,” the spokesperson said. At the root of the courtroom battle are allegations that Meta officials violated a 2012 Federal Trade Commission (FTC) order under which the company agreed to stop collecting and sharing Facebook users’ personal data without their consent. Facebook allegedly later sold the data to commercial partners, including political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica; it was also accused of removing disclosures from privacy settings that were required under the FTC’s order. In 2019, Meta agreed to pay the FTC $5 billion to settle charges that the company violated the 2012 order. The company has also paid penalties from regulators in Europe.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/08/uber-eats-launches-tiktok-like-video-feed/,Uber Eats launches a TikTok-like video feed to boost discovery,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Uber Eats is launching a TikTok-like short-form video feed to boost discovery and help restaurants showcase their dishes. Uber Eats’ senior director of Product, Awaneesh Verma, told TechCrunch exclusively in an interview that the new feed is being tested in New York, San Francisco and Toronto. The company plans to launch the feed worldwide in the future. With this launch, Uber Eats now joins numerous other popular apps that have launched their own short-form video feeds following TikTok’s rise in popularity, including , YouTube Snapchat and Netflix to name a few. TechCrunch also recently learned that LinkedIn has started experimenting with its own TikTok-like feed. The new Uber Eats short-form videos are visible in carousels placed across the app, including the homescreen. Once you click on a video preview, you will enter into a vertical feed of short-form content that you can swipe through. You will only see content from restaurants that are close enough to deliver to you. Verma says the feed is designed to replicate the experience of being in a restaurant in person and seeing people preparing food and being inspired to try something new. As you swipe through the feed, you may come across a video of an ice cream shop preparing a Nutella milkshake, or a video of an Indian restaurant packing rice separately from curry so it doesn’t get soggy by the time it gets delivered to your house. “The early data shows people are much more confident trying new dishes and trying things that they otherwise wouldn’t have,” Verma said. “Even little things like being able to see texture, and the details of what a portion size looks like, or what’s in a dish, has been really inspiring for our users.” Uber Eats notes that the videos aren’t ads, as the company isn’t charging merchants for the content placements. Many restaurants run social media accounts on apps like Instagram and TikTok to reach new customers and showcase their food using short-form videos. By allowing merchants to share short-form videos directly in the Uber Eats app, the company is helping restaurants reach customers directly as they decide what to order. As for consumers, many people already use social media to discover new places and dishes to try, so Uber Eats likely hopes that its new feed will encourage users to try to find inspiration directly within its own app. Some users might not see the launch as a welcome addition to the app, as they may feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of different short-form video feeds in popular apps. While it may make sense to have short-form video feeds in entertainment and social media apps, the introduction of one in a food-delivery app may not be a favorable choice for some. Verma also shared that in order to further support merchants, the company has revamped its Uber Eats Manager software and added personalized growth recommendations. The software is now capable of encouraging restaurants to grow their business by doing things like running a promotion on a certain dish or adding photos to menu listings. In addition, the company is going to launch an entirely new app for restaurant managers this summer that is designed to make it easier for restaurants to be more proactive on the go. For instance, the app could alert a restaurant manager that their store is having issues or that they may want to boost sales with new ads. Uber Eats announced on Monday that it now has more than 1 million merchants around the world on its platform, across 11,000 cities in six continents.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/13/apple-introduces-protection-to-prevent-thieves-from-getting-your-passwords/,Apple introduces protection to prevent thieves from getting your passwords,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Apple introduced new security settings with the iOS 17.3 developer beta on Tuesday to prevent thieves from entering your passcode to get your info, including account passwords. Apple will likely roll out the final version of iOS 17.3 in a few weeks. The new protections include the mandatory use of Face ID or Touch ID before performing sensitive actions like looking at passwords or using saved payment methods in Safari. Apple said that users will have to opt into the Stolen Device Protection setting through Settings > Face ID & Passcode > Stolen Device Protection in iOS 17.3 beta. Once you turn on this setting, the device will require biometrics for things like accessing iCloud keychain passwords, turning off lost mode, sending money from Apple Cash to your bank account, erasing all content and settings and using your iPhone to set up a new device. Plus, certain actions will require biometric authentication along with a delay such as changing your Apple ID password, adding or removing Face ID or Touch ID, disabling Find My and turning off stolen device protection. Users will have to pass the biometric authentication again after an hour of delay to complete these tasks for added security. The new changes Apple introduced in the developer beta will make it difficult for thieves to change passwords or get payment information even if they know your passcode. Earlier this year, The Wall Street Journal wrote multiple reports describing how thieves observed people at bars before stealing their iPhones to figure out the passcodes protecting these devices. Once the thieves stole the devices, they quickly entered passcodes and changed users’ passwords, including their iCloud accounts and payment accounts. “As threats to user devices continue to evolve, we work tirelessly to develop powerful new protections for our users and their data. iPhone data encryption has long led the industry, and a thief can’t access data on a stolen iPhone without knowing the user’s passcode. In the rare cases where a thief can observe the user entering the passcode and then steal the device, Stolen Device Protection adds a sophisticated new layer of protection,” Apple said in a statement. The feature is currently accessible to folks testing the developer version and the final version will be available to all users when the company releases the final version of iOS 17.3.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/16/meta-put-on-watch-over-terrorism-content-in-the-eu/,Meta put on watch over terrorism content in the EU,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Ireland’s media regulator has put social media giant Meta on watch over terrorist content takedowns again — it issued a decision against Facebook on Monday. The Coimisiún na Meán said the tech giant would have to take “specific measures” to prevent its services from being used for the dissemination of terrorist content and report back to the regulator on the measures taken. The decision follows a similar determination by Coimisiún na Meán against Meta-owned Instagram in November, along with TikTok and X. The Irish authority plays an oversized role in regulating tech giants’ compliance with a range of digital rule books due to how many opt to locate their regional headquarters in Ireland. The relevant bit of Ireland’s online safety framework that Coimisiún na Meán is enforcing in today’s decision is a pan-EU law on terrorist content takedowns that was agreed to by the bloc’s lawmakers back in 2021 . It requires hosting service providers — in this case social media platforms — to remove terrorist content within one hour of it being reported. Penalties under the regime can reach up to 4% of global annual turnover. “Under the Terrorist Content Online Regulation, hosting service providers which receive two or more final removal orders from EU competent authorities within the last 12 months may be determined as being exposed to terrorist content,” the Irish regulator wrote in a press release . “An Coimisiún has reached this decision [against Meta-owned Facebook] following the notification of two or more final removal orders in respect of this providers and following engagement with this provider.” It’s not clear exactly which type of terrorist content was found on Facebook and notified to the regulator. We’ve asked for more details. Meta has been contacted for a response to the Coimisiún na Meán decision. Update: Meta spokesman Ben Walters emailed a statement in which the company wrote: “This designation means CnaM [Coimisiún na Meán] can assess the measures we have in place to deal with terrorist content.” The company also claimed to have “one of the most comprehensive approaches in the industry targeting dangerous organisations and individuals,” adding: “[L]ast quarter, we found and removed over 99% of this type of violating content before it was even reported to us.” Topics Senior Reporter Natasha was a senior reporter for TechCrunch, from September 2012 to April 2025, based in Europe.

TikTok has been under scrutiny in the United States for a while. Last year, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew testified before Congress for five hours, addressing lawmakers’ concerns about Chinese authorities accessing American data (TikTok, an American company, is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company). Chew has repeatedly stated that TikTok and ByteDance are not conduits for the Chinese government. There is no evidence that the Chinese government has accessed Americans’ TikTok user data, but in a separate incident, ByteDance employees were fired for gaining access to the IP addresses of journalists to track their location . TikTok is banned on government-issued phones in dozens of states. This week, the app’s struggles in the U.S. government escalated when a bill was introduced that would give the president the ability to identify social media apps that are threats to national security, which would remove them from app stores. The bill’s sponsors are urging TikTok to sever its ties with ByteDance to avoid this fate, or else it could lose its 170 million American users. TikTok confirmed to TechCrunch that this message appeared for users 18+ in the United States, but based on our own testing, not all users in that demographic received the pop-up. The platform has previously tapped its community to support its battles in Congress. When Chew made his first appearance in Congress last year, TikTok invited a group of creators, including Vitus Spehar ( UnderTheDeskNews ), to go to D.C. to lobby on the app’s behalf. “Congress made clear that they don’t understand TikTok, they don’t listen to their constituents who are in the community of TikTokers — and are using this TikTok hysteria as a way to pass legislation that gives them superpowers to ban any app they deem ‘unsafe’ in the future,” Spehar told TechCrunch at the time.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/27/cppa-admt-draft-rules/,California’s privacy watchdog eyes AI rules with opt-out and access rights,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us California’s Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) is preparing for its next trick: Putting guardrails on AI. The state privacy regulator, which has an important role in setting rules of the road for digital giants given how much of Big Tech (and Big AI) is headquartered on its sun-kissed soil, has today published draft regulations for how people’s data can be used for what it refers to as automated decisionmaking technology (ADMT*). Aka AI. The draft represents “by far the most comprehensive and detailed set of rules in the ‘AI space’”, Ashkan Soltani, the CPPA’s exec director, told TechCrunch. The approach takes inspiration from existing rules in the European Union, where the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has given individuals rights over automated decisions with a legal or significant impact on them since coming into force back in May 2018 — but aims to build on it with more specific provisions that may be harder for tech giants to wiggle away from. The core of the planned regime — which the Agency intends to work on finalizing next year, after a consultation process — includes opt-out rights, pre-use notice requirements and access rights which would enable state residents to obtain meaningful information on how their data is being used for automation and AI tech. AI-based profiling could even fall in scope of the planned rules, per the draft the CPPA has presented today. So — assuming this provision survives the consultation process and makes it into the hard-baked rules — there could be big implications for US adtech giants like Meta which has a business model that hinges on tracking and profiling users to target them with ads. Such firms could be required to offer California residents the ability to deny their commercial surveillance, with the proposed law stating b usinesses must provide consumers with the ability to opt-out of their data being processed for behavioral advertising. The current draft further stipulates that behavioral advertising use-cases cannot make use of a number of exemptions to the opt-out right that may apply in other scenarios (such as if ADMT is being used for security or fraud prevention purposes, for example). The CPPA’s approach to regulating ADMT is risk-based, per Soltani. This echoes another piece of in-train EU legislation: the AI Act — a dedicated risk-based framework for regulating applications of artificial intelligence which has been on the table in draft form since 2021 but is now at a delicate stage of co-legislation , with the bloc’s lawmakers clashing over the not-so-tiny-detail of how ( or even whether ) to regulate Big AI, among several other policy disputes on the file. Given the discord around the EU’s AI Act, as well as the ongoing failure of US lawmakers to pass a comprehensive federal privacy law — since there’s only so much presidential Executive Orders can do — there’s a plausible prospect of California ending up as one of the top global rulemakers on AI. That said, the impact of California’s AI rules is likely to remain local, given its focus on affording protections and controls to state residents. In-scope companies might choose to go further — such as, say, offering the same package of privacy protections to residents of other US states. But that’s up to them. And, bottom line, the CPPA’s reach and enforcement is tied to the California border. Its bid to tackle AI follows the introduction of GDPR-inspired privacy rules, back in 2019, with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) coming into effect in early 2020 . Since then the Agency has been pushing to go further. And, in fall 2020, a ballot measure secured backing from state residents to reinforce and redefine parts of the privacy law. The new measures laid out in draft today to address ADM are part of that effort. “The proposed regulations would implement consumers’ right to opt out of, and access information about, businesses’ uses of ADMT, as provided for by the [CCPA],” the CPPA wrote in a press release. “The Agency Board will provide feedback on these proposed regulations at the December 8, 2023, board meeting, and the Agency expects to begin formal rulemaking next year.” In parallel, the regulator is considering draft risk assessment requirements which are intended to work in tandem with the planned ADMT rules. “ Together, these proposed frameworks can provide consumers with control over their personal information while ensuring that automated decisionmaking technologies, including those made from artificial intelligence, are used with privacy in mind and in design,” it suggests. “Once again, California is taking the lead to support privacy-protective innovation in the use of emerging technologies, including those that leverage artificial intelligence. These draft regulations support the responsible use of automated decisionmaking while providing appropriate guardrails with respect to privacy, including employees’ and children’s privacy.” The planned regulations deal with access and opt-out rights in relation to businesses’ use of ADMT. Per an overview of the draft regulation, the aim is to establish a regime that will let state residents request an opt-out from their data being used for automated decisionmaking — with a relatively narrow set of exemptions planned where use of the data is necessary (and solely intended) for either: Security purposes (“t o prevent, detect, and investigate security incidents” ); fraud prevention; safety (“to protect the life and physical safety of consumers”); or for a good or service requested by the consumer. The latter comes with a string of caveats, including that the business “has no reasonable alternative method of processing”; and must demonstrate “(1) the futility of developing or using an alternative method of processing; (2) an alternative method of processing would result in a good or service that is not as valid, reliable, and fair; or (3) the development of an alternative method of processing would impose extreme hardship upon the business”. So — tl;dr — a business that intends to use ADMT and is trying to use a (crude) argument that, simply because the product contains automation/AI users can’t opt-out of their data being processed/fed to the models, looks unlikely to wash. At least not without the company going to extra effort to stand up a claim that, for instance, less intrusive processing would not suffice for their use-case. Basically, then, the aim is for there to be a compliance cost attached to trying to deny consumers the ability to opt-out of automation/AI being applied to their data. Of course a law that lets consumers opt-out of privacy-hostile data processing is only going to work if the people involved are aware how their information is being used. Hence the planned framework also sets out a requirement that businesses wanting to apply ADMT must provide so-called “pre-use notices” to affected consumers — so they can decide whether to opt-out of their data being used (or not); or indeed whether to exercise their access right to get more info about the intended use of automation/AI. This too looks broadly similar to provisions in the EU’s GDPR which put transparency (and fairness) obligations on entities processing personal data — in addition to requiring a valid lawful basis for them to use personal data. Although the European regulation contains some exceptions — such as where info was not directly collected from individuals and fulfilling their right to be informed would be “unreasonably expensive” or “impossible” — which may have undermined EU lawmakers’ intent that data subjects should be kept informed. (Perhaps especially in the realm of AI — and generative AI — where large amounts of personal data have clearly been scraped off the Internet but web users have not been proactively informed about this heist of their info; see, for example, regulatory action against Clearview AI . Or the open investigations of OpenAI’s ChatGPT .) The proposed Californian framework also includes GDPR-esque access rights which will allow state residents to ask a business to provide them with: Details of their use of ADMT; the technology’s output with respect to them; how decisions were made (including details of any human involvement; and whether the use of ADMT was evaluated for “validity, reliability and fairness”); details of the logic of the ADMT, including “key parameters” affecting the output; and how they applied to the individual; information on the range of possible outputs; and info on how the consumer can exercise their other CCPA rights and submit a complaint about the use of ADMT. Again, the GDPR provides a broadly similar right — stipulating that data subjects must be provided with “meaningful information about the logic involved” in automated decisions that have a significant/legal effect on them. But it’s still falling to European courts to interpret where the line lies when it comes to how much (or how specific the) information algorithmic platforms must hand over in response to these GDPR subject access requests (see, for example, litigation against Uber in the Netherlands where a number of drivers have been trying to get details of systems involved in flagging accounts for potential fraud). The CCPA looks to be trying to pre-empt attempts by ADMT companies to evade the transparency intent of providing consumers with access rights — by setting out, in greater detail, what information they must provide in response to these requests. And while the draft framework does include some exemptions to access rights, just three are proposed: Security, fraud prevention and safety — so, again, this looks like an attempt to limit excuses and (consequently) expand algorithmic accountability. Not every use of ADMT will be in-scope of the CCPA’s proposed rules. The draft regulation proposes to set a threshold as follows: The Agency also says the upcoming consultation will discuss whether the rules should also apply to: profiling a consumer for behavioral advertising; p rofiling a consumer the business has “actual knowledge is under the age of 16” (i.e. profiling children); and p rocessing the personal information of consumers to train ADMT — indicating it’s not yet confirmed how much of the planned regime will apply to (and potentially limit the modus operandi of) adtech and data-scraping generative AI giants. The more expansive list of proposed thresholds would clearly make the law bite down harder on adtech giants and Big AI. But, it being California, the CCPA can probably expect a lot of pushback from local giants like Meta and OpenAI, to name two. The draft proposal marks the start of the CPPA’s rulemaking process, with the aforementioned consultation process — which will include a public component — set to kick off in the coming weeks. So it’s still a ways off a final text. A spokeswoman for the CPPA said it’s unable to comment on a possible timeline for the rulemaking but she noted this is something that will be discussed at the upcoming board meeting, on December 8. If the Agency is able to move quickly it’s possible it could have a regulation finalized in the second half of next year. Although there would obviously need to be a grace period before compliance kicks in for in-scope companies — so 2025 looks like the very earliest for a law to be up and running. And who knows how far developments in AI will have moved on by then. * The CPPA’s proposed definition for ADMT in the draft framework is “ any system, software, or process — including one derived from machine-learning, statistics, other data-processing or artificial intelligence — that processes personal information and uses computation as whole or part of a system to make or execute a decision or facilitate human decisionmaking”. Its definition also affirms “ADMT includes profiling” — which is defined as “ any form of automated processing of personal information to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person and in particular to analyze or predict aspects concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, location, or movements” Europe’s AI Act talks head for crunch point President Biden issues executive order to set standards for AI safety and security Topics Senior Reporter Natasha was a senior reporter for TechCrunch, from September 2012 to April 2025, based in Europe.

The company is adding a new privacy feature that allows you to customize your profile to remove the tab that displays your replies. This leaves only the two tabs that show posts and reposts. The addition offers an option to make your profile and use of Threads more private, without having to switch to a fully private profile, which would limit the visibility of your posts to only your followers and those you choose to reply to. While Threads’ main “For You” feed offers a mix of posts, including replies , they’re less likely to be surfaced by the algorithm, which already reduces their visibility. Offering a feature that turns off the ability for others to browse your replies on your profile would make them even more difficult for others to surface. The feature was first spotted by Threads user and reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi , who said the option was rolling out to the iOS app. An Instagram spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the option to show or hide replies was something the company had recently started testing with a “small number of people,” and had not yet publicly launched. To see if you have the feature, you can click the “Edit Profile” button on your Threads user profile and then scroll down to the option labeled “Show your Replies.”  By default, this is enabled, but you can opt to toggle it off. The company notes that even if you disable showing your replies publicly, you can still view your replies from the Threads app Settings, where you can also view other types of content like your Saved items, Likes, Archive, and more. This is not the only control around Replies that Threads has introduced. The company previously launched a way to limit who can reply to your posts, allowing you to choose between anyone, profiles you follow, or those you’ve mentioned only — similar to X. Hiding more personal interactions like replies could help boost engagement among Threads users. Similarly, X earlier this year chose to make everyone’s Likes private , so users would feel more comfortable engaging with content, which also helps to inform X’s recommendations.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/13/tiktok-car-confessionals-are-the-new-youtube-bedroom-vlogs/,TikTok car confessionals are the new YouTube bedroom vlogs,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us YouTube’s first viral scandal took place in what we believed was a 16-year-old girl’s bedroom. In 2006, homeschooled teenager Bree Avery vlogged about her life under the username Lonelygirl15 , chronicling her supposedly boring life. But as the videos got more and more outlandish — her parents turned out to be part of a blood-harvesting cult? — fans uncovered the truth that the whole vlog was fake ; the Los Angeles-based creators of the channel were experimenting with a new form of storytelling, almost like a “Blair Witch Project” for the early aughts. Even after it was revealed that Bree was a paid actor named Jessica Lee Rose, fans still obsessed over her vlogs, which (in the beginning) are all told to us from the privacy of her bedroom. Though it was actually a carefully constructed set, the background of Bree’s videos — a pink quilted bedspread with a plush monkey, a small wooden bookcase topped with candlesticks, some moody posters pasted to the walls — are emblematic of this formative YouTube era. Almost 20 years later, we watch microvlogs on TikTok, which are recorded on smartphones that we keep attached to our bodies like we’re cyborgs. But in this era, creators’ childhood bedrooms have been replaced with generic car interiors. It doesn’t really matter the make or model of the car, so long as it is a car. “I just thought it was weird — so weird! — to see so many TikToks in cars: make-up reviews, little jokey skits, singing, eating Indian food, whatever,” Nathan Ma, a cultural critic and lecturer, told TechCrunch. Ma noted the transition from bedroom vlogs to parked car TikToks in a post on X after watching a food vlogger eat Indian food in his car. Really fascinated at how on TikTok, the interior of our cars is the backdrop for broadcast experiences, just as the bedroom was the bedrock set on YouTube https://t.co/aA8I2ysd2P — nathan ma (@nthnashma) October 16, 2023 When comedian James Corden hosted “The Late Late Show,” he amplified this video style with his carpool karaoke series, which featured artists like Paul McCartney and Adele. Almost a decade later, vocal coach Cheryl Porter, who has 18.6 million TikTok followers, makes videos doing singing exercises with her clients while in the car. Keith Lee, a TikTok creator with 15.4 million followers, can make or break a restaurant with his food reviews, many of which are filmed in his car. This brand of video — the in-car, parking lot food review — originated on YouTube , since it’s a way for reviewers to try food while it’s fresh, even if eating a spread of Ethiopian food and injera without a table seems less than ideal. Our familiarity with seeing people make content from their cars has greased the wheel for us to accept parked car microvlogging without question. “I think there’s a lot of social commentary TikTok videos where the social capital for the TikToker is, ‘I just know this, I’m just that smart, I just thought about this while I was getting out of my car,’” said temi lasade-anderson , a PhD candidate at King’s College London researching Black women’s digital intimacy and confessional vlogging. In contrast with YouTube bedroom vlogs, she told TechCrunch, car TikToks are “a lot more quick and dirty. It’s on the fly and on the cuff.” Though cars are more transient settings than bedrooms, both afford the creator privacy. For TikTokers with spouses, roommates or children, it’s possible that their car is the easiest place to record a TikTok without being interrupted. Plus, the lighting in cars is generally good. But these settings communicate different things to the viewer — a bedroom confessional vlog inherently imparts a sense of intimacy or secrecy. A car TikTok can give off the same vibe, depending on the subject matter the creator is talking about, but more often, it implies casualness. It’s much easier to record a TikTok than film and edit a whole YouTube video, but TikToks often aren’t as spontaneous as they seem. Filming in your car is ELITE!! #tiktokcontentcreators #tiktokgrowthtips #growontiktok ♬ original sound – Keira Jones | TikTok Coach It’s the aesthetic ideal of the format to appear as though you’re creating something so casually that you’re just filming it while running errands. But even these nonchalant TikToks can be rehearsed, scripted or filmed in several takes. It’s the visual equivalent of ending an email with “no worries if not.” And if a car TikTok sparks backlash, the creator can easily walk back their commentary by pointing out that it was just something they thought of while going about their day-to-day life. But if the TikTok is successful, then the creator reaps the “social capital,” as lasade-anderson put it, of appearing so smart that they can come up with something brilliant without really trying. The transition from YouTube vlog to car TikTok also shows a movement from private to public space. “Back then, being a vlogger or doing vlogs was weird,” lasade-anderson told TechCrunch. “It wasn’t a thing that was socially and culturally accepted as a form of content creation, or a thing you’d do, so the bedroom was a private haven.” Bedroom vlogs often took the form of confessionals, wherein a YouTuber will speak directly to the camera about personal experiences and struggles. The genre is almost like an online version of the religious confession, or even a reality TV confessional, lasade-anderson points out. And like the religious confession, some of these vlogs can take the form of apologies — think about the unforgettable Colleen Ballinger apology via ukulele . “The confessional vlog as a format was almost like therapy in a sense, where people are talking about what’s going on and how they’re feeling about it,” lasade-anderson said. For early lifestyle influencers, it was a strategy to build a following by seeming “authentic,” though now, the idea of “authenticity” is so overplayed that it’s the Merriam-Webster word of the year. At the time, it was refreshing that social media allowed anyone to voice their seemingly unfiltered thoughts, and we all got to be voyeurs to random people’s lives. But as we learned as early as lonelygirl15, nothing on social media is exactly as real as it seems — whether it’s a bedroom confessional or a short TikTok filmed in an Arby’s parking lot.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/21/poland-chatgpt-gdpr-complaint-probe/,Poland opens privacy probe of ChatGPT following GDPR complaint,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us OpenAI is facing another investigation into whether its generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, complies with European Union privacy laws. Last month a complaint was filed against ChatGPT and OpenAI in Poland, accusing the company of a string of breaches of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Yesterday the Polish authority took the unusual step of making a public announcement to confirm it has opened an investigation. “The Office for Personal Data Protection [UODO] is investigating a complaint about ChatGPT, in which the complainant accuses the tool’s creator, OpenAI, of, among other things, processing data in an unlawful, unreliable manner, and the rules under which this is done are opaque,” the UODO wrote in a press release [translated from Polish to English using DeepL ]. The authority said it’s anticipating a “difficult” investigation — noting OpenAI is located outside the EU and flagging the novelty of the generative AI chatbot technology whose compliance it will be examining. “The case concerns the violation of many provisions of the protection of personal data, so we will ask OpenAI to answer a number of questions in order to thoroughly conduct the administrative proceedings,” said Jan Nowak, president of the UODO, in a statement. Deputy president, Jakub Groszkowski, added a warning to the authority’s press release — writing that new technologies do not operate outside the legal framework and must respect the GDPR. He said the complaint contains allegations that raise doubts about OpenAI’s systemic approach to European data protection principles, adding that the authority would “clarify these doubts, in particular against the background of the fundamental principle of privacy by design contained in the GDPR”. The complaint, which was filed by local privacy and security researcher Lukasz Olejnik , accuses OpenAI of a string of breaches of the pan-EU regulation — spanning lawful basis, transparency, fairness, data access rights, and privacy by design. It focuses on OpenAI’s response to a request by Olejnik to correct incorrect personal data in a biography ChatGPT generated about him — but which OpenAI told him it was unable to do. He also accuses the AI giant of failing to properly respond to his subject access request — and of providing evasive, misleading and internally contradictory answers when he sought to exercise his legal rights to data access. The tech underlying ChatGPT is a so-called large language model (LLM) — a type of generative AI model that’s trained on masses of natural language data so it can both respond in a human like manner. But also, given the general purpose utility of the tool, it’s evidently been trained on all sorts of types of information so it can respond to different questions and asks — including, in many cases, being fed data about living people. OpenAI’s scraping of the public Internet for training data, without people’s knowledge or consent, is one of the big factors that’s landed ChatGPT in regulatory hot water in the EU. Its apparent inability to articulate exactly how it’s processing personal data; or to correct mistakes when its AI “hallucinates” and produces false information about named individuals are others. The bloc regulates how personal data is processed, requiring a processor has a lawful basis to collect and use people’s information. Processors must also meet transparency and fairness requirements. Plus a suite of data access rights are afforded to people in the EU — meaning EU individuals have (among other things) a right to ask for incorrect data about them to be rectified. Olejnik’s complaint tests OpenAI’s GDPR compliance across a number of those dimensions. So any enforcement could be significant in shaping how generative AI develops. Reacting to the UODO’s confirmation it’s investigating the ChatGPT complaint, Olejnik told TechCrunch: “Focusing on privacy by design/data protection by design is absolutely critical and I expected this to be the main aspect. So this sounds reasonable. It would concern the design and deployment aspects of LLM systems.” He previously described the experience of trying to get answers from OpenAI about its processing of his information as feeling like Josef K, in Kafka’s book “The Trial.” “If this may be the Josef K. moment for AI/LLM, let’s hope that it may shed light on the processes involved,” he added now. The relative speed with which the Polish authority is moving in response to the complaint, as well as its openness about the investigation, does look notable. It adds to growing regulatory issues OpenAI is facing the European Union. The Polish investigation follows an intervention by Italy’s DPA earlier this year — which led to a temporary suspension of ChatGPT in the country. The scrutiny by the Garante continues, also looking into GDPR compliance concerns attached to factors like lawful basis and data access rights. Elsewhere, Spain’s DPA has opened a probe . While a taskforce set up via the European Data Protection Board earlier this year is looking at how data protection authorities should respond to the AI chatbot tech with the goal of pushing to find some consensus among the bloc’s privacy watchdogs on how to regulate such novel tech. The taskforce does not supplant investigations by individual authorities. But, in the future, it may lead to some harmonization in how DPAs approach regulating cutting edge AI. That said, divergence is also possible if there are strong and varied views among DPAs. And it remains to be seen what further enforcement actions the bloc’s watchdogs could take on tools like ChatGPT. (Or, indeed, how quickly they may act.) In the UODO’s press release — which nods to the existence of the taskforce — its president says the authority is taking the ChatGPT investigation “very seriously”. He also notes the complaint’s allegations are not the first doubts vis-a-vis ChatGPT’s compliance with European data protection and privacy rules. Discussing the authority’s openness and pace, Maciej Gawronski of law firm GP Partners, which is representing Olejnik for the complaint, told TechCrunch: “UODO is becoming more and more vocal about privacy, data protection, technology and human rights. So, I think, our complaint creates an opportunity for [it] to work on reconciling digital and societal progress with individual agency and human rights. “Mind that Poland is a very advanced country regarding IT. I would expect UODO to be very reasonable in their approach and proceedings. Of course, as long as OpenAI remains open, for discussion.” Asked if he’s expecting a quick decision on the complaint, Gawronski added: “The authority is monitoring technology advancements pretty closely. I am at UODO’s conference on new technologies at the moment. UODO has already been approached re AI by various actors. However, I do not expect a fast decision. Nor it is my intention to conclude the proceedings prematurely. I would prefer to have an honest and insightful discussion with OpenAI on what, when, how, and how much, regarding ChatGPT’s GDPR compliance, and in particular how to satisfy rights of the data subject.” OpenAI was contacted for comment on the Polish DPA’s investigation but did not send any response. The AI giant is not sitting still in response to an increasingly complex regulatory picture in the EU. It recently announced opening an office in Dublin, Ireland — likely with an eye on building towards streamlining its regulatory situation for data protection if it can funnel any GDPR complaints via Ireland. However, for now, the US company is not considered “main established” in any EU Member State (including Ireland) for GDPR purposes, since decisions affecting local users continue to be taken at its US HQ in California. So far, the Dublin office is just a tiny satellite. This means data protection authorities across the bloc remain competent to investigate concerns about ChatGPT that arise on their patch. So more investigations could follow. Complaints which predate any future main establishment status change for OpenAI could also still be filed anywhere in the EU.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/what-does-mark-zuckerbergs-shirt-say/,What does Mark Zuckerberg’s shirt say?,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Three years ago, Mark Zuckerberg’s big day was a flop. At his company’s annual developer conference — then called Facebook Connect — he unveiled his grand plans to turn his trillion-dollar social network into “a metaverse company.” He changed the name of his company to Meta, and we braced for a world where we would become one with our virtual avatars, who could maybe even one day have legs . And yet, that seismic shift never happened. For the most part, the metaverse was smoke and mirrors. His company’s stock plummeted , and for the first time ever, Facebook wasn’t growing . Then, Meta conducted several rounds of mass layoffs. It seemed like the fall of an empire, but Zuckerberg managed to reverse the fate of his sinking ship. In calls with concerned investors, he stopped using the word “ metaverse ,” and when the AI boom came around, he was thrilled to pivot to a new buzzword. The stock went up. As his company recovered from crisis, Zuckerberg had a glow-up himself. Now, he has become something of a fashionista . While he used to be known for looking like a ghost in front of the Senate and awkwardly professing his love for barbecue sauce , he has an unexpected hint of swagger now. But he isn’t just wearing Alexander McQueen suits, training with top MMA fighters, and calling it a day. Now, he’s making his own clothes with fashion designer Mike Amiri. So when Zuckerberg strolled onstage at this year’s Meta Connect event — three years after the metaverse fiasco — his outfit mattered. At what might be Meta’s most impressive developer keynote ever, Zuckerberg wore a structured black tee and jeans, a classic look for Silicon Valley founders who want to make us feel like they’re one of us (except that they’re powerful billionaires). But upon closer inspection, his shirt makes a bold declaration: Aut Zuck aut nihil The letters stretch across the sleeves and chest in a way that’s on trend, yet hard to read, especially if you’re not familiar with the ancient Latin declarations of Roman emperors. The original phrase, aut Caesar aut nihil , translates to “either Caesar or nothing.” It’s an expression of the desire to become a supreme ruler at any cost. “I started working with people to design some of my own clothes,” he said on the Acquired podcast. “I figured, you know, look, we’re going to design eyewear, we’re going to design other stuff that people wear — let’s get good at this.” These T-shirts are part of a series he designed for himself, which are based on his favorite classical sayings. Another of his shirts is emblazoned with the ancient Greek phrase pathei mathos , which means “learning through suffering.” In May, he wore a shirt with the phrase Carthago delenda est to his 40th birthday party, which means, “Carthage must die,” a call for Rome to attack Carthage during the Punic Wars. He also used the phrase in 2011, when Google launched the would-be Facebook-killer Google+. It’s a variation on the same theme: Zuckerberg still thinks he’s fighting the system, not that he is that system. The messages Zuckerberg conveys through his attire are deliberate. But what’s a Harvard dropout to the ancient Roman general who established one of history’s most formidable empires? Comparing himself to Julius Caesar is cocky, but to be fair, Zuckerberg runs a company whose products touch billions of people every day. His reach transcends that of Julius Caesar. And, if all goes according to his plans, he’ll be building wearable AI gadgets and virtual reality headsets that change how the world communicates, once again. No matter how big Meta has become, Zuckerberg’s outfits reveal that he still imagines himself as an antagonist to more established tech companies. In these comparisons, Zuckerberg isn’t Caesar, the established emperor. He thinks of himself as the earlier Caesar, a valiant general destined for greatness, taking on an empire greater than himself.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/10/tiktok-now-supports-direct-posting-from-ai-powered-adobe-apps-capcut-twitch-and-more/,"TikTok now supports direct posting from AI-powered Adobe apps, CapCut, Twitch and more",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us TikTok today is introducing a new feature that will allow its users to post directly to the video platform from a range of popular editing apps, including Adobe’s AI-powered video editing software Premiere Pro, its AI creativity app Adobe Express, as well as others, including Twitch, SocialPilot and ByteDance’s CapCut. The new offering, Direct Post, is actually aimed at the developers of third-party apps that want to integrate more closely with TikTok and builds on TikTok’s existing “Share to” integrations which allowed third-party apps to publish to TikTok along with their own hashtags. With Direct Post, however, apps not only have the ability to post video content directly to TikTok’s platform, they can also take advantage of other options, like the ability to set captions, audience settings and more within their own platform, then send information through to TikTok with a single click. In addition, the feature allows long-form video creators to schedule their content to publish to TikTok through social media management platforms. The addition will make it possible for TikTok to benefit from the advances in the wider creativity app landscape, including those apps that are leveraging AI technology as part of the video editing process. To use the feature, creators authenticate with their TikTok account within the third-party app. The apps that have partnered with TikTok are also vetted through an auditing process before being allowed to use Direct Post’s Content Posting API. Adobe, which just today unveiled a host of new AI software and technology at its annual MAX conference, is a key partner for TikTok’s new feature. The company will now be offering Direct Post from Adobe Premiere Pro, which offers AI-powered video editing tools, and Adobe Express, a lightweight AI-powered creativity app. “Now more than ever, publishing content in real-time has become a necessity, and creators of all skill levels need tools that can empower them with greater efficiency and without constraints,” said Deepa Subramaniam, Adobe VP of Creative Cloud product marketing, in a statement about the launch. “With the new Direct Post feature for TikTok available in Adobe Express and Premiere Pro, creators can continue to create standout content, but with increased speed and without any interruption to their creative workflows.” Other partners include CapCut, a popular video editing tool from TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, which is also the second app from the company to hit the $100 million milestone, data.ai recently reported. In addition, Twitch streamers will be able to use Twitch’s Clip Editor to covert their clips to portrait mode for direct sharing on TikTok and will also have the option to export their portrait clip to TikTok as a draft, so they can continue their edits. The social media marketing tool SocialPilot is adopting Direct Post, as well, bringing the option to professionals, teams, agencies and businesses that need to automate their social media posting. Access to the API is open to developers of creative tools and video editing apps. The API will soon support photos, too, TikTok notes.

That’s a major change for the online advertising industry, and after years of talking about it and releasing various experiments, it’s about to get real for the online advertising industry. Starting in early 2024, Google plans to migrate 1% of Chrome users to Privacy Sandbox and disable third-party cookies for them, the company announced today. Google’s plan to completely deprecate third-party cookies in the second half of 2024 remains on track. In addition, with the launch of the Chrome 115 release in July, Google is making Privacy Sandbox’s relevance and measurement APIs generally available to all Chrome users, making it easy for developers to test these APIs with live traffic. Google doesn’t plan to make any significant changes to the API after this release. Deprecating third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome users doesn’t sound like it would have a major impact, but as Google’s Victor Wong, who leads product for Private Advertising Technology within Privacy Sandbox, told me, it will help developers assess their real-world readiness for the larger changes coming in late 2024. To get ready for this, developers will also be able to simulate their third-party cookie deprecation readiness starting in Q4 2023, when they’ll be able to test their solutions by moving a configurable percentage of their users to Privacy Sandbox. “This plan was developed with close consultation and coordination with UK’s Competition and Markets Authority — the CMA. We consulted with them on this and we felt this is the best way to, jointly with the industry, actually test out the solution,” Wong explained. “In Q4 [2023], we help coordinate some of the testing and make that easier. Q1 [2024], we deprecate for 1%, which then, for everyone in the industry, forces them to seriously start experimenting and testing.” With the launch of Chrome 115, most adtech developers should be able to start testing their solutions at scale. At that point, Privacy Sandbox features like Protected Audience, Attribution Reporting and the Topics API will be locked in. It’s worth noting that today, users can already turn on the Privacy Sandbox trials in Chrome. The APIs have been available for testing since the launch of the Chrome 101 beta. But that’s obviously quite different from being able to test these APIs at scale. “A lot of folks have been asking for more scaled availability, because today, obviously, only a minority of users currently have sandbox available. So just even to do testing there is quite limited. But we’re seeing a lot of interest to scale that up,” said Wong. He also noted that Google doesn’t currently have any plans for intermediary steps throughout 2023 to scale this number beyond 1%. Once it decides to fully deprecate, Google plans to go from 1% to 100% without any milestones in-between (though there will obviously be a bit of a ramp-up). Google’s original plan had called for phasing out tracking cookies as early as 2022, but the company changed that timeline back in 2021 and then again in 2022 . “I don’t think it’s an overstatement to say how big of a deal this initiative is, at least in the history of the web. So we’re taking a very deliberate approach based on the input of voices across the ecosystem, including developers, regulators, policymakers and advertisers. We heard from a lot of these partners, saying more time was needed to make sure that they could test and adapt,” Wong said. But he also noted that the company is seeing a lot of people in the ecosystem starting to move very quickly now that these deadlines are approaching. Some partners, he thinks, may already be at the point where they could make the switch today. It’s no secret that Privacy Sandbox isn’t uncontroversial and other browser vendors are taking very different approaches to preserving their users’ privacy. With the CMA closely watching Google’s initiative, the company has committed to a set of guidelines that should ensure that there are no self-preferencing practices in how it implements Privacy Sandbox that could give it an advantage over its competitors. As none of the competitors seem particularly keen on adopting Privacy Sandbox, the implications for the overall web advertising ecosystem remain to be seen.

With the budget Quest 3S now up for preorder, Meta will no longer sell the Quest 2 and Quest Pro once back stock is deleted. The end of the Quest 2 isn’t surprising. The headset is long in the tooth, celebrating its fourth birthday in October. Meta kept the legacy device on sale as a way to offer a cheaper alternative to the Quest 3. The new Quest 3S, however, now occupies its place in the lineup with its $300 starting price. It also shares some key characteristics with the new 3S model, including display resolution. The Quest Pro, on the other hand, debuted in 2022 as Meta’s bid to offer up its mixed reality for enterprise. The truth is, however, that last year’s Quest 3 made the Pro model largely redundant, and did so at a lower price point. Here’s what Meta has to say on the matter: “[Y]ou  know what they say about new beginnings. With Quest 3S on the shelf, we’re officially winding down sales of Quest 2 and Pro. We’ll be selling our remaining headsets through the end of the year or until they’re gone, whichever comes first. If you’d like a carrying case, the Touch Pro controllers, the Quest 2 Active Pack, or any of the other accessories for Quest 2 and Pro, we plan to continue selling those for a bit longer.” Notably, Meta is also ending security patch updates for the original Quest headset in September. Presumably such support for the Quest 2 and Quest Pro 2 will last a while longer. Topics Brian Heater was the Hardware Editor at TechCrunch until early 2025.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/21/pinkydoll-npc-tiktok-sex-work-not-fetish-content/,Leave sex workers out of your NPC TikTok discourse,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Every time a woman monetizes the absurd, she’s accused of making fetish content. It’s a symptom of the anti-sex moral panic sweeping pop culture — and this time, it’s coming for TikTok’s NPC creators. Snippets of these creators’ livestreams keep going viral, and because the internet loves to hate on women, the nonsensical mannerisms that these creators use in their content has been written off as disturbing, cringe and definitely a sex thing. Sex workers, meanwhile, are unfairly dragged into dehumanizing conversations about the genre. What onlookers actually seem to be mad about is the fact that these creators — most of whom are attractive young women — manage to profit off of being weird online. The phrase NPC, or “non-playable character,” refers to video game characters whose personalities, dialogue and story lines cannot be controlled by the player. Instead, all interactions with NPCs are preset, which means the characters are limited to repeating their loops with little other substance. Online, particularly on TikTok, Reddit and 4chan, NPC is used as a derogatory term for people who aren’t all there. 😕 i’ve never been more confused in my entire life dawg…… pic.twitter.com/Y43gcySN1k — IAWT (@marloaviani) July 12, 2023 NPC behavior is typically shallow and slightly uncanny. One TikTok creator described NPCs as lacking critical thinking, empathy and “passion and intrigue for higher concepts.” If you tend to give canned answers and rarely deviate from your daily routine, you might be an NPC. In other words, you aren’t the main character; at best, you fill in the background of someone else’s life. Despite the demeaning connotations, NPCs are having their moment in the spotlight. The once niche NPC livestreams are gaining popularity as a lucrative genre of content. In these streams, creators imitate the awkward, stiff movements typically seen in throwaway characters that didn’t get enough design time. With neutral facial expressions and mesmerizing consistency, they sway back and forth, utter catchphrases in return for digital currency and above all, stay in character for hours at a time. Fedha Sinon, a TikTok creator known as PinkyDoll, became the face of the trend this month when clips of her livestreams went viral on Twitter. Her content perplexed viewers. She pops popcorn kernels with a hair straightener. She responds to gifts with repetitive phrases like “mmm ice cream so good,” “gang gang” or, for select viewers, “love you!” In one of her most popular bits, she pretends to pop balloons across the screen with hypnotizing cadence of a practiced ASMR artist. “It’s an NPC control kink,” one Twitter user commented on a video of Sinon’s stream. “Don’t look [too] much into it … I wish I didn’t. Butttt basically they’re controlling her like a video game character.” Others accused her of “catering to pedos” because she initially told viewers that she’s 19 years old, not 27. One commentary creator NPC TikTok as “just another gateway drug for getting boys hooked on fetish porn.” Another Twitter user called Sinon an “NPC sex doll for incels.” The comments are degrading to both NPC TikTok creators and to sex workers. The sudden attention on NPC creators opened the door for bad faith discourse around online sex work, even though these TikTok creators aren’t making this content for sexual gratification. Criticizing NPC livestreams as predatory kink content adds to the stigma surrounding sex work. Even if the content that NPC creators are making isn’t explicitly sexual, the criticism targeting them is inherently linked to the anti-sex sentiments pervading online culture. “NPC is not a kink specifically for pedophiles. Let’s be careful with our language,” dominatrix and adult content creator Heaux House tweeted . “There are NPC creators that have existed before ppl found out about ole girl … Be sure to be very clear on what and who you’re critiquing. Don’t do that thing y’all do where sex work(ers) get hit with your misinformed tweets.” TikTok livestream creators make money when their viewers send them gifts. Viewers can buy TikTok coins , and use those to purchase digital gifts, which each have their own monetary value; 65 coins cost about $1, 1,321 coins cost about $20 and 6,607 coins cost about $100. TikTok users can then spend the coins on a variety of gifts, which range from an ice cream cone (1 coin) to a balloon (300 coins.) Higher-ticket items include an octopus (10,000 coins), “Sam the whale” (30,000 coins) and TikTok stars, which clock in at 39,999 coins. this was tweeted only 6 days ago now everyone on tiktok live is trying to be like her https://t.co/BqLd0psA0H — ari (@AriannaDantone) July 17, 2023 Gifts are converted to “Diamonds,” which creators can withdraw. TikTok takes a 50% cut, so an octopus, for example, will amount to 5,000 Diamonds for the creator, or about $75 . Sinon, and the wave of creators joining in on the trend she started, unlocked the golden formula for monetizing livestreams. The weirder they act, the more people will stay to watch. The more people who send them money, the weirder they’ll act. Creators with consistent viewership can rake it in if they’re live for hours at a time. Sinon told Motherboard that she streams six hours a day, seven days a week. When she started, she made $250 per day. After going viral this month, she averages between $2,000 to $3,000 per stream, The New York Times reports . Across her social media accounts, including Instagram and OnlyFans, she makes around $7,000 per day. Despite speculation from others online, NPC content isn’t fetish content. Though Sinon and Cherry Crush, another popular live creator, also create content for OnlyFans, their TikTok streams are not sexually explicit. They don’t wear revealing clothing. They aren’t being compensated for providing sexual services. Although their NPC videos may drive curious viewers to their paywalled adult content, they don’t promote their other accounts on their livestreams. They also don’t incorporate NPC content into their NSFW platforms. “I don’t make my show sexually suggestive at all,” Cherry Crush told The New York Times . “I always thought it was just funny & entertaining.” There is a transactional nature to the content that Sinon and Cherry Crush make, and their appearance does influence their popularity. But being conventionally attractive and good at monetizing an audience does not make these creators predatory sex workers. NPC TikTok creators are the latest to be accused of pushing fetish content onto vulnerable, impressionable minors. Other genres that are supposedly guilty of being vehicles for secret kinks include ASMR content, excessively messy food channels and viral crafting “hacks” that might feature a woman’s hands or feet. TikTok creators themselves have built followings by reacting to off-putting videos and judging whether or not the videos are secretly fetish content. There is NSFW content that overlaps with these genres — the age-old Rule 34 asserts that if it exists, there’s some kind of porn about it online. But that explicit content, which is produced with the intention of sexual gratification, can exist independently from the genre itself. Writing off any weird behavior as kink content further demonizes sex work as predatory and shameful. Social media users tend to assume that content they don’t immediately understand must be perverse, especially if it’s presented by a young woman. We exist in an era of the internet that simultaneously sexualizes women who exist publicly, and yet is increasingly hostile toward sex work. Women have been targets of “grossness from creeps” even if they aren’t a “fetish content creator,” as Twitter user darshanaheena said “I’ve gotten that exact same treatment just from blogging on tumblr,” she tweeted. “I used to do occasional sponsored posts with swimwear on tumblr and guys would post my blog photos to fetish site discussion boards and they would all find my tumblr and leave me gross messages/replies. None of my content was sexual in nature, people are gross regardless.” The possibility that fetish videos could be “hiding in plain sight” on TikTok, an app that is just as popular with adults as it is with children, instills an unrelenting moral panic among those who aren’t online themselves. Purity culture is back with a vengeance, and the war on sex extends beyond political affiliation and generational divides. Boomers with Facebook accounts will find “evidence” of coded language for grooming in anything. Gen Z’s “puriteens” have been criticized for decrying common depictions of sexuality, like on-screen nudity between two consenting adult characters, as exploitative, predatory and problematic. Fandom culture, which once pioneered online sex positivity through fanfiction, is becoming more regressive by the day. It all feeds the same narrative: sex is scary and coming for your children. It’s almost easier to assume that a young woman who profits off of acting odd must be catering to some kind of sexual desire. The reality isn’t that scandalous or particularly deep. Sometimes people just want to watch mindless, stimulating content from a pretty woman — and that doesn’t make it secretly porn.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/16/meta-tracking-gdpr-data-transfer-breach/,Use of Meta tracking tools found to breach EU rules on data transfers,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Austria’s data protection authority has found that use of Meta’s tracking technologies violated EU data protection law as personal data was transferred to the US where the information was at risk from government surveillance. The finding flows from a swathe of complaints filed by European privacy rights group noyb, back in August 2020 , which also targeted websites’ use of Google Analytics over the same data export issue. A number of EU DPAs have since found use of Google Analytics to be unlawful — and some (such as France’s CNIL) have issued warnings against use of the analytics tool without additional safeguards. But this is the first finding that Facebook tracking tech breached the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). All the decisions follow a July 2020 ruling by the European Union’s top court that struck down the high level EU-US Privacy Shield data transfer agreement after judges once again identified a fatal clash between US surveillance laws and EU privacy rights. (A similar finding, back in 2015 , invalidated Privacy Shield’s predecessor: Safe Harbor.) noyb trumpets the latest data transfer breach finding by an EU DPA as “ groundbreaking ” — arguing that the Austrian authority’s decision should send a signal to other sites that it’s not advisable to use Meta trackers (the complaint concerns Facebook Login and the Meta pixel). The decision relates to use of Meta’s tracking tools by a local news website (its name is redacted from the decision) as of August 2020 — which the site in question stopped using shortly after the complaint was filed. However the decision could have much broader implications for use of Meta’s tech, given how much personal data the adtech giant processes. So while the breach finding relates to just one of the sites noyb targeted in this batch of strategic complaints there are implications for scores more and — potentially — for any EU site that’s still using Meta’s tracking tools given the ongoing legal uncertainty around EU-US data transfers. “Facebook has pretended that its commercial customers can continue to use its technology, despite two Court of Justice judgments saying the opposite. Now the first regulator told a customer that the use of Facebook tracking technology is illegal,” said Max Schrems, chair of noyb.eu, in a statement. “Many websites use Facebook tracking technology to track users and show personalized advertisement. When websites include this technology they also forward all user data to the US multinational and onwards to the NSA [US National Security Agency]. While the European Commission is still aiming to publish the third EU-US data transfer deal, the fact that US law still allows bulk surveillance means that this matter will not be solved any time soon,” noyb further suggests in a press release . For its part, Meta has responded to the news by seeking to play down the significance of the Austrian DPA’s decision. In a statement, a company spokesperson claimed the finding is “based on historical circumstances” — and suggested it “does not impact how businesses can use our products”. Here’s its statement in full: This decision is based on historical circumstances and only relates to a single company in connection with its use of Facebook Pixel and Facebook Login on a single day in 2020. While we disagree with many aspects of the decision, it does not impact how businesses can use our products. This case stems from a conflict between EU and US law which is in the process of being resolved. In the 46-page decision [NB: the link is to a machine translated (non-official) English version] the Austrian DPA sets out its reasoning for finding a local site’s use of Meta tracking tools breached the GDPR’s requirements on data transfers, noting that the regulation requires that data on EU users is adequately protected if it’s transferred out of the bloc, to so-called third countries (such as the US). Yet it found none of the possible protections for such data exports (such as an adequacy decision) applied in this instance — hence determining that the GDPR’s Article 44 (on data transfers) was violated. Another key component of the decision is that data collected by Meta’s tracking technologies — which includes a large number of data-points, including IP address, user ID, mobile OS and browser data, screen resolution, Facebook cookie data and much more — constitutes personal data under EU law. “As a result of the implementation of Facebook Business Tools, cookies were set on [the] end device of the complainant… which contain a unique, randomly generated value… This makes it possible to individualise the complainant’s terminal device and record the complainant’s surfing behaviour in order to display suitable personalised advertising,” the DPA explains. “Irrespective of this, at least Meta Ireland had the possibility to link the data it received due to the implementation of Facebook Business Tools on [the] complainant’s Facebook account. It is clear from the Facebook Business Tools Terms of Use… that Facebook Business Tools are used, inter alia, to exchange information with Facebook.” Some changes Meta made to its data transfer T&Cs shortly after noyb’s complaints had been filed predated this action — so came too late to affect the outcome. However noyb suggests any such terms tweaks and/or supplementary measures would be unlikely to make a difference given that personal data remains accessible to Meta (and can therefore be passed to U.S. security agencies) — so, for example, the option of implementing ‘zero knowledge’ encryption, i.e. as a supplementary measure to boost the level of protection for the data, is not available to an adtech giant whose business model hinges on tracking and profiling web users by processing their data. “The DPA already found in the Google decision that such elements cannot overcome US law,” Schrems told TechCrunch when we asked about the changes Meta made to its data transfers terms after noyb’s complaints, adding: “I would assume this would not lead anywhere given the case law.” The DPA’s decision makes direct reference to Meta’s own transparency reports , where it records government requests for data — that it says show “the Meta Group regularly receives data access requests from US secret authorities”, further specifying “the data access requests also concern users from Austria”. As well as basic subscriber info, it says requests can ask for records related to account activity and stored contents — such as messages, photos, videos, time line entries and location information. France’s data watchdog warns over illegal use of Google Analytics Zooming out, while EU and U.S. negotiators have provisionally agreed a replacement transatlantic data transfer pact — which they’re calling the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF) — this third bite at fixing the data-transfer schism is not yet up and running as it still needs to be scrutinized by other EU institutions before the Commission can formally adopt it. That means there’s still a gaping hole in the legal regime governing EU-U.S. data transfers — one which could remain unplugged for several months yet (back in December the Commission suggested the DPF wouldn’t be in place before July). Additionally, even if (or when) the new EU-US data transfer framework is adopted by the EU it’s highly likely to face the same core challenge that struck down its predecessors, given U.S. mass surveillance programs have not been reformed. This raises doubts about the long term survival of the planned replacement framework — so legal uncertainty in this area is pretty much a given whatever happens in the short term. noyb argues that the only long-term fix for this issue is either reform of U.S. surveillance law to provide “baseline protections for foreigners to support their tech industry”. Or data localization — meaning U.S. providers would be forced to host foreign data outside of the country. And we are seeing some moves in that direction ( such as from TikTok , which faces even greater scrutiny than Facebook over matters connected to national security). It’s not clear if data localization is much of a fix for Meta’s (or indeed TikTok’s) problems, though — given how data-mining users is central to their ad-targeting business model. (“It is well known that due to its US–based system, Meta is categorically unable to ensure that the data of European citizens is not intercepted by US Intelligence agencies,” noyb suggests.) In the meanwhile, a final decision on whether to suspend Meta’s EU-US data transfers remains pending from its lead EU DPA, the Irish Data Protection Commission. So it really is down to the wire on which will come first: A new EU-US data transfers sticking plaster — which would reset the legal challenges and buy Meta a new round of operational breathing space in Europe — or a final DPA order to stop transferring EU users’ data over the pond. Although, in the latter case, Meta would certainly appeal a suspension order — so the most likely outcome is that Meta will get to kick the can down the road yet again and European privacy advocates will have to gird themselves for a fresh round of legal challenges, hoping the CJEU will be even faster on pulling the trigger this time. EU DPAs have shown extreme reluctance to enforce the law around data transfers, dragged their feet when it came to acting on the Court of Justice’s July 2020 decision striking down Privacy Shield, for example. So the same scenario could well repeat next time around, creating a cycle of law-breaking that’s almost never enforced — and a parody where EU users’ fundamental rights should be. noyb’s 101 complaints were filed over two and half years ago — and this is only the first decision related to Facebook tracking tools. Asked what’s happened with the rest, Schrems told us: “We are still waiting on all others. We do not know why the Google [Analytics] cases went quicker but we assume the Irish DPA took more of a role in the Facebook cases.” Ireland’s DPA remains the target of fierce criticism over its approach to GDPR enforcement on Big Tech — with cases piling up on its desk and eventual outcomes often slammed as underwhelming Another problem noyb highlights relates to the lack of a penalty being issued alongside the Austrian DPA’s breach finding. So even though there is a breach finding there’s still no tangible consequence for the site that broke the law by relying on Meta’s tech. “There is no information if a penalty was issued or if the [Austrian authority] is planning to also issue a penalty. The GDPR foresees penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of the global turnover in such cases but data protection authorities seem unwilling to issue fines, despite controllers ignoring two CJEU rulings for more than two years,” it writes. “The Austrian DPA never issues fines in complaints procedures, as there is a separate unit in charge of fines,” Schrems explains. “This is a very problematic approach, leading to ‘double procedures’ and a very low number of fines.” All these issues will add fuel to arguments the EU’s flagship data protection framework isn’t doing what it says on the tin — which will dial up pressure on Commission lawmakers for, if not hard reform of GDPR, then at least effective oversight, through proper monitoring of how the regulation is enforced at the Member State level. That seems necessary if the bloc’s lawmakers are going to keep being able to sell an increasingly broad and deep (interconnected) regime of digital regulation that frequently claims data protection as the foundational underpinning for greater levels of data processing and sharing . Put another way, data protection can’t only exist on paper; people need to see their information is actually protected.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/23/meta-releases-its-biggest-open-ai-model-yet/,Meta releases its biggest ‘open’ AI model yet,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Meta’s latest open source AI model is its biggest yet. Today, Meta said it is releasing Llama 3.1 405B, a model containing 405 billion parameters. Parameters roughly correspond to a model’s problem-solving skills, and models with more parameters generally perform better than those with fewer parameters. At 405 billion parameters, Llama 3.1 405B isn’t the absolute largest open source model out there, but it’s the biggest in recent years. Trained using 16,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, it also benefits from newer training and development techniques that Meta claims makes it competitive with leading proprietary models like OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet (with a few caveats). As with Meta’s previous models, Llama 3.1 405B is available to download or use on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. It’s also being used on WhatsApp and Meta.ai, where it’s powering a chatbot experience for U.S.-based users. Like other open and closed source generative AI models, Llama 3.1 405B can perform a range of different tasks, from coding and answering basic math questions to summarizing documents in eight languages (English, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish and Thai). It’s text-only, meaning that it can’t, for example, answer questions about an image, but most text-based workloads — think analyzing files like PDFs and spreadsheets — are within its purview. Meta wants to make it known that it is experimenting with multimodality. In a paper published today, researchers at the company write that they’re actively developing Llama models that can recognize images and videos, and understand (and generate) speech. Still, these models aren’t yet ready for public release. To train Llama 3.1 405B, Meta used a dataset of 15 trillion tokens dating up to 2024 (tokens are parts of words that models can more easily internalize than whole words, and 15 trillion tokens translates to a mind-boggling 750 billion words). It’s not a new training set per se, since Meta used the base set to train earlier Llama models, but the company claims it refined its curation pipelines for data and adopted “more rigorous” quality assurance and data filtering approaches in developing this model. The company also used synthetic data (data generated by other AI models) to fine-tune Llama 3.1 405B. Most major AI vendors, including OpenAI and Anthropic, are exploring applications of synthetic data to scale up their AI training, but some experts believe that synthetic data should be a last resort due to its potential to exacerbate model bias. For its part, Meta insists that it “carefully balance[d]” Llama 3.1 405B’s training data, but declined to reveal exactly where the data came from (outside of webpages and public web files). Many generative AI vendors see training data as a competitive advantage and so keep it and any information pertaining to it close to the chest. But training data details are also a potential source of IP-related lawsuits, another disincentive for companies to reveal much. In the aforementioned paper, Meta researchers wrote that compared to earlier Llama models, Llama 3.1 405B was trained on an increased mix of non-English data (to improve its performance on non-English languages), more “mathematical data” and code (to improve the model’s mathematical reasoning skills), and recent web data (to bolster its knowledge of current events). Recent reporting by Reuters revealed that Meta at one point used copyrighted e-books for AI training despite its own lawyers’ warnings. The company controversially trains its AI on Instagram and Facebook posts, photos and captions, and makes it difficult for users to opt out . What’s more, Meta, along with OpenAI, is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit brought by authors, including comedian Sarah Silverman, over the companies’ alleged unauthorized use of copyrighted data for model training. “The training data, in many ways, is sort of like the secret recipe and the sauce that goes into building these models,” Ragavan Srinivasan, VP of AI program management at Meta, told TechCrunch in an interview. “And so from our perspective, we’ve invested a lot in this. And it is going to be one of these things where we will continue to refine it.” Llama 3.1 405B has a larger context window than previous Llama models: 128,000 tokens, or roughly the length of a 50-page book. A model’s context, or context window, refers to the input data (e.g. text) that the model considers before generating output (e.g. additional text). One of the advantages of models with larger contexts is that they can summarize longer text snippets and files. When powering chatbots, such models are also less likely to forget topics that were recently discussed. Two other new, smaller models Meta unveiled today, Llama 3.1 8B and Llama 3.1 70B — updated versions of the company’s Llama 3 8B and Llama 3 70B models released in April — also have 128,000-token context windows. The previous models’ contexts topped out at 8,000 tokens, which makes this upgrade fairly substantial — assuming the new Llama models can effectively reason across all that context . All of the Llama 3.1 models can use third-party tools, apps and APIs to complete tasks, like rival models from Anthropic and OpenAI. Out of the box, they’re trained to tap Brave Search to answer questions about recent events, the Wolfram Alpha API for math- and science-related queries, and a Python interpreter for validating code. In addition, Meta claims the Llama 3.1 models can use certain tools they haven’t seen before — to an extent. If benchmarks are to be believed ( not that benchmarks are the end-all be-all in generative AI), Llama 3.1 405B is a very capable model indeed. That’d be a good thing, considering some of the painfully obvious limitations of previous-generation Llama models. Llama 3.1 405B performs on par with OpenAI’s GPT-4, and achieves “mixed results” compared to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, per human evaluators that Meta hired, the paper notes. While Llama 3.1 405B is better at executing code and generating plots than GPT-4o, its multilingual capabilities are overall weaker, and Llama 3.1 405B trails Claude 3.5 Sonnet in programming and general reasoning. And because of its size, it needs beefy hardware to run. Meta recommends at least a server node. That’s perhaps why Meta’s pushing its smaller new models, Llama 3.1 8B and Llama 3.1 70B, for general-purpose applications like powering chatbots and generating code. Llama 3.1 405B, the company says, is better reserved for model distillation — the process of transferring knowledge from a large model to a smaller, more efficient model — and generating synthetic data to train (or fine-tune) alternative models. To encourage the synthetic data use case, Meta said it has updated Llama’s license to let developers use outputs from the Llama 3.1 model family to develop third-party AI generative models (whether that’s a wise idea is up for debate ). Importantly, the license still constrains how developers can deploy Llama models: App developers with more than 700 million monthly users must request a special license from Meta that the company will grant on its discretion. That change in licensing around outputs, which allays a major criticism of Meta’s models within the AI community, is a part of the company’s aggressive push for mindshare in generative AI. Alongside the Llama 3.1 family, Meta is releasing what it’s calling a “reference system” and new safety tools — several of these block prompts that might cause Llama models to behave in unpredictable or undesirable ways — to encourage developers to use Llama in more places. The company is also previewing and seeking comment on the Llama Stack, a forthcoming API for tools that can be used to fine-tune Llama models, generate synthetic data with Llama and build “agentic” applications — apps powered by Llama that can take action on a user’s behalf. “[What] We have heard repeatedly from developers is an interest in learning how to actually deploy [Llama models] in production,” Srinivasan said. “So we’re trying to start giving them a bunch of different tools and options.” In an open letter published this morning, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg lays out a vision for the future in which AI tools and models reach the hands of more developers around the world, ensuring people have access to the “benefits and opportunities” of AI. It’s couched very philanthropically, but implicit in the letter is Zuckerberg’s desire that these tools and models be of Meta’s making. Meta’s racing to catch up to companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, and it is employing a tried-and-true strategy: give tools away for free to foster an ecosystem and then slowly add products and services , some paid, on top. Spending billions of dollars on models that it can then commoditize also has the effect of driving down Meta competitors’ prices and spreading the company’s version of AI broadly. It also lets the company incorporate improvements from the open source community into its future models. Llama certainly has developers’ attention. Meta claims Llama models have been downloaded over 300 million times, and more than 20,000 Llama-derived models have been created so far. Make no mistake, Meta’s playing for keeps. It is spending millions on lobbying regulators to come around to its preferred flavor of “open” generative AI. None of the Llama 3.1 models solve the intractable problems with today’s generative AI tech, like its tendency to make things up and regurgitate problematic training data. But they do advance one of Meta’s key goals: becoming synonymous with generative AI. There are costs to this. In the research paper, the co-authors — echoing Zuckerberg’s recent comments — discuss energy-related reliability issues with training Meta’s ever-growing generative AI models. “During training, tens of thousands of GPUs may increase or decrease power consumption at the same time, for example, due to all GPUs waiting for checkpointing or collective communications to finish, or the startup or shutdown of the entire training job,” they write. “When this happens, it can result in instant fluctuations of power consumption across the data center on the order of tens of megawatts, stretching the limits of the power grid. This is an ongoing challenge for us as we scale training for future, even larger Llama models.” One hopes that training those larger models won’t force more utilities to keep old coal-burning power plants around Topics AI Editor LIMITED TIME: Save $300+ on your ticket, plus an additional 50% on a second for a full immersive day of AI!

https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/11/tiki-india/,"Tiki, a popular short video app in India, to shut down",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Tiki, a short-form video app, is set to cease operations in India on June 27, the latest addition to a growing roster of businesses that have faltered in their attempts to cash in on the void created by New Delhi’s ban on TikTok in the South Asian market. “We regret to inform you that Tiki will be shutting down its operations. As of 11.59 PM India time, June 27, 2023, all Tiki functions and services will cease,” wrote Tiki in a post. The demise of Tiki, which featured original and local-focused videos, comes as a surprise, as it maintained some 35 million monthly active users in India, its only operational market, according to data from Sensor Tower (shared by an industry executive). The Singapore-headquartered Tiki launched in India immediately after New Delhi banned TikTok. It remains a mystery how the video app, which was owned by an entity called Dol Technologies, was bankrolled. Many industry executives told TechCrunch that they believed that the firm was a loose subsidiary of one of the Chinese video apps that got nuked by New Delhi in mid-2020. “The recent challenges faced by the tech industry have led to the closure of numerous startups,” a post on Tiki’s social media accounts said. “Despite being a small startup operating in Singapore and India, Tiki has always stood for being a place for real talents,” said the post, signed by ‘Team Tiki.’ The end of Tiki comes at a time when India’s short video market is seeing rapid consolidation and exits. Times Internet sold MX Player’s short video business to ShareChat last year , whereas Xiaomi shut its short video offering Zili earlier this month in the country.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/31/privacy-assistant-jumbo-tears-down-its-paywall/,Privacy assistant Jumbo tears down its paywall,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Jumbo , an app that lets you control your privacy on the web, is hitting the reset button — sort of. While the company is still focused on privacy and security, users can now download and use all features for free as the premium subscription is gone. In addition to this pricing update, Jumbo’s newest version now includes free identity theft insurance for people based in the U.S. “Something we didn’t anticipate and that we’re tying to fix today is that a paid product creates an important barrier to entry,” Jumbo founder and CEO Pierre Valade told me. Valade previously founded Sunrise , a popular calendar app that was acquired by Microsoft. Jumbo’s flagship feature is a dashboard that lets you control your privacy settings across various online services. You can use the app to connect to your Facebook, LinkedIn or Instagram account and adjust privacy settings, such as the visibility of posts you’re tagged in. For social networks in particular, Jumbo can delete and archive old posts. For instance, you can use the app to delete tweets that are older than a certain threshold. Jumbo saves everything on your phone in a local storage area called the Vault. And Jumbo stands out from other privacy assistants as it doesn’t rely on APIs to control your online accounts. Instead, Jumbo works more or less like a web browser in the background. Everything happens on your device (which is great for privacy) and the startup isn’t limited to what’s possible with official APIs. In many ways, Jumbo exposes privacy settings to people who don’t know that these settings exist and don’t understand what they’re supposed to do. Sure, anyone can already check Google’s account page and delete Google Maps activities, past web searches and YouTube keywords. But Jumbo centralizes all these settings in a simple consumer app. It regularly scans your account activity and even tells you that you should probably enable two-factor authentication to improve your account’s security. At first, Jumbo thought that consumer subscription was the only business model that could turn Jumbo into a sustainable business without any compromise. It’s easy to understand how companies make money when there’s a paid subscription. “We reached 25,000 paid subscribers and we realized that it was quite small for a consumer subscription business,” Valade said. “And there was another issue — churn.” Every year, around 40% of Jumbo users would keep their subscription active. If you’ve run a subscription business, you know that this isn’t a bad churn rate. But it means that the company had to spend money on marketing and paid installs to compensate this churn rate. Even with paid subscriptions, Jumbo wasn’t turning a profit. Hence, today’s pivot. Going forward, Jumbo will be a free consumer app with a business offering coming later this year. This hasn’t been an easy decision. Jumbo is a smaller company today, with around 25 employees — the marketing team has been laid off. Valade told me that at some point he thought about calling it a day and selling the company to the highest bidder. “We realized that we were limiting our growth rate because we offer a paid product. The best business model on the internet is B2B software as a service,” Valade said. The startup raised some fresh funding in a $17 million round led by Index Ventures with some existing investors and several angel investors also participating. The company has reached a post-money valuation of $77 million. Tearing down the paywall is one thing, but how will people hear about Jumbo now? Pierre Valade is adding identity theft insurance to the app, and turning this insurance product into a social feature. When you download the app, Jumbo now offers identity theft insurance for free in the U.S. with up to $25,000 in coverage through IdentityForce . Identity theft is a big issue in the U.S. with malicious people opening unauthorized credit cards under someone else’s name and other wrongdoings that can cost you a lot of money. Currently, identity theft insurance products are mostly paid products. For example, Norton offers LifeLock for $125 per year while IDShield plans start at $15 per month. Jumbo’s new insurance product pairs well with the rest of the app as Jumbo alerts you in case of a new data breach that may contain some personal information (using SpyCloud’s data). Usually, when you’re aware of a new data breach, you don’t really know what you’re supposed to do. Every time you invite a friend or a family member to Jumbo, it increases your insurance coverage by $25,000 with a hard cap at $1,000,000. Essentially, it encourages Jumbo users to invite other people to the app. As for the business offering? “Today, we don’t really know the feature set [for businesses]. Right now, I’m really focused on demonstrating that the free product can truly grow significantly faster than before,” Valade told me. Some companies could pay for Jumbo to encourage their employees to set up two-factor authentication on their personal accounts, for instance. I asked about other business-oriented security startups like Riot . “We sell simplicity,” he told me. “Phishing training is not really consumer friendly.” Let’s see how this B2B pivot will play out, as Jumbo is still very much a consumer app for now. But it seems like Valade feels better about his startup’s positioning now. “We were frustrated with the fact that we had to oversell the product to consumers,” he said. “You end up scaring people in order to convince them, and we were becoming uncomfortable with that.” Topics Senior Reporter LIMITED TIME: Save $300+ on your ticket, plus an additional 50% on a second for a full immersive day of AI!

This week had two major events from OpenAI and Google. OpenAI’s spring update event saw the reveal of its new model, GPT-4o, which has voice and vision capabilities that can turn ChatGPT into a virtual assistant seemingly aspiring to be “Her.” Hot off OpenAI’s tail, Google’s I/O conference featured a smattering of announcements and integrations for its flagship model, Gemini. This week also saw some major shake-ups at AWS and OpenAI. AWS CEO Adam Selipsky is stepping down and will be replaced by AWS sales chief Matt Garman. And OpenAI co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever has departed the company along with Jan Leike. Sutskever will be replaced by Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI’s director of research. There was also a significant shift at Meta. TechCrunch exclusively reported that the company is shutting down its enterprise communications business, Workplace.

The solution will allow brands to collaborate with TikTok effect creators to design custom effects — like AR experiences and other interactive features — to accompany their online campaigns and marketing efforts. The solution, Effect House Branded Effects, is an extension of TikTok’s existing development platform Effect House, launched roughly a year ago. With Effect House, the company had put the tools needed to develop AR effects into creators’ hands, allowing them to extend TikTok’s existing AR effect library — a competitive feature for its app. The suite also includes other things AR effect creators would need to get started, like templates, tutorials, and documentation that explains how to create specific types of effects, like Segmentation, Face Mask, Head Tracker, Face Stretch and 3D Face, as well as how to use different textures, materials, lighting and shadows, and more. TikTok launches its own AR development platform, Effect House Now, with the launch of Branded Effects, businesses can begin to work with TikTok’s top effect creators to build out effects for the brand’s social media and online campaigns that also include specific features, like calls-to-action or custom audience targeting, among other things. Brands can use Branded Effects to engage users in a number of ways, like offering ways to virtually try-on makeup, change the user’s hair color, have them put on a hat, overlay a sticker or frame onto the video, follow dance moves, use head movements to steer a vehicle, unlock animations by scanning images, text or objects in real life and more. The company suggests the product makes sense for a range of businesses, including brands working in spaces like personal care, beauty, consumer packaged goods, entertainment and retail. TikTok says Branded Effects also allow the brand to boost their content to a wider audience through things like paid branding traffic solutions and can place their effects in premium placements on the effect panel’s “Trending” tab for greater visibility. In addition, TikTok says all its ad formats support showcasing the Branded Effects and can drive viewers to the app’s Effects Page, where the Branded Effect could then be selected with a tap. Brands are also able to control what brand-safe videos appear on the effect’s detail page to ensure that only appropriate or positive videos are showcased when TikTok users look up the effect on the app to see how other people are using it. “We’ve seen brands use effects on TikTok in all kinds of creative ways to reach new audiences, share stories, and build community,” said Greg Feingold, Effect House Community Lead, in a statement. “By working with top Effect House creators to create effects, brands can further harness the creativity and authenticity of the TikTok community.” TikTok noted that Microsoft was among the businesses already using effects to reach TikTok’s online community. In a blog post , TikTok said that Microsoft 365’s agency Superdigital had leveraged Effect House to create the WordArt You effect in partnership with Effect House creators Eddy Adams (@eddyin3d) and Jan Trejo (@janmahavan), which resulted in 126,000 TikTok videos featuring the effect and millions of views. Another early adopter, Mucinex, ran a Branded Effect campaign that saw a 42.7% lift in purchase intent, according to an online case study . Other Branded Effect testers included beauty brand Laneige, gum maker Dirol, Netflix Germany and Shoppers Drug Mart. The timing of the announcement is interesting, given the threat of a potential TikTok ban in the U.S. has had advertisers scrambling to develop contingency plans as to where to shift their marketing efforts if TikTok is no longer accessible. As Reuters recently reported , brands and agencies have been having meetings, but for some seeing strong performance from their TikTok ads, there’s no plan to pull out as of yet. The report also cited data from Insider Intelligence that claims TikTok’s U.S. ad revenue is expected to reach $6.83 billion this year, from $780 million in 2020.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/29/snapchat-complies-with-the-california-privacy-rights-act-with-a-new-toggle-switch-for-users/,Snapchat complies with the California Privacy Rights Act with a new toggle switch for users,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Snapchat is adding a new privacy setting that enables users based in California to better protect their sensitive personal information. The company confirmed it’s rolling out a feature designed to comply with the California Privacy Rights Act ( CPRA ), which takes effect on January 1, 2023, and applies to personal data collected on or after January 1, 2022. In November 2020, California residents voted to pass the CPRA, also known as Proposition 24, which builds on an earlier consumer privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act ( CCPA ) of 2018. While the CCPA gave residents the right to access and delete personal information held by businesses and opt out of the sale of that data, the new law puts into place further requirements for businesses around their data collection practices and data retention. It also introduces new notification requirements and clarifies that users have the right to opt out of both the sharing and the sale of their personal information, while also adding a new category of “sensitive data.” The law created the California Privacy Protection Agency to enforce the state’s privacy laws, as well as investigate violations and assess penalties if warranted. Consumers based in California, meanwhile, will gain the right to not only know who’s collecting their information, but also be able to access it, correct it, delete it and transfer it, and to stop its sale and sharing, without being penalized as a result. As part of this, they’ll also gain the ability to access their options through “easily accessible” self-serve tools. Snapchat’s implementation would seemingly address the latter with a simple toggle switch under its Privacy Controls section in the app’s Settings screen. Here, users will be presented with a new option at the bottom of the list that reads “California Privacy Choices.” A tap into this screen (as spotted by competitive intelligence provider Watchful — see below image) reveals a new option to “Limit the use of sensitive personal information.” This page explains that enabling the setting would require Snapchat to limit the use of users’ personal info, including things like precise geolocation. The setting, however, is appearing in the Snapchat app for all U.S. users — even those who don’t live in California. Snapchat confirmed the new privacy feature is rolling out in compliance with the CPRA, but notes it functions only for those users in California. The addition is interesting, as it demonstrates how a popular mobile app has chosen to comply with the new legislation. And unlike on Facebook — where settings are buried, difficult to find, and constantly being relocated — Snapchat’s new privacy feature is relatively easy to find. All of the app’s settings are available from one main screen, organized into sections. So the new CPRA-compliant setting isn’t something users have to dig around to find.

The “Hidden Words” feature automatically mutes common words, phrases, and emojis that might be offensive to users. In addition to these preset filters, users can add their own custom words and phrases in the settings. Users can turn these settings off at any point in time. Earlier this week, dating app Hinge launched its own “Hidden Words” feature (yes, with the same name) to block requests with comments that contain unwanted words . Threads said that the feature will filter out content from both the “Following” and “For You” feeds, search results, profiles, and replies to posts. The Meta-owned social network already allows users to control who can reply to their posts: anyone, profiles you follow, or mentioned people only. Threads also has the option to restrict who can mention you in their posts, replies, and bio: everyone, profiles you follow, or no one. Now the company is planning to introduce similar controls for quote posts. Threads said that it will soon let you limit who can quote your posts. Additionally, users will be able to manually unquote their posts as well. The company’s rationale behind these new controls for quote posts is that it wants to restrict unwanted interactions. “Since quoting a post is one of the most visible ways to connect with someone on Threads, it was important for us to give people more agency over who can engage with them and help reduce unwanted interactions,” a company spokesperson said. Separately, Threads is also testing a way to mute notifications for interactions with posts.

GM ’ s decision to no longer fund its self-driving car subsidiary Cruise was a surprise to many — and got me thinking about this startup that I’ve come to know over the years. About nine years ago, I learned about a startup called Cruise Automation . The San Francisco-based startup, co-founded by Kyle Vogt and Dan Kan in 2013, had just shifted its business plan away from developing direct-to-consumer kits to retrofit vehicles and instead turned its attention and efforts to self-driving software. The autonomous vehicle world was a small and dynamic place back in 2015. Cruise had a few dozen employees, and Waymo didn’t even exist yet, as it was still described as the Google self-driving project . The people who would go on to found Aurora , Nuro Argo AI were still at other companies, namely Google. Zoox had just been founded the year before. The hype had not engulfed the industry yet. But that would come soon enough, and for me, the moment that really kicked it off was March 2016 when GM acquired Cruise for $1 billion , a story that Dan Primack and I broke when we both still worked at Fortune. There is too much history to share in this shortish newsletter, but it’s safe to say that autonomous vehicle technology was on the minds of automaker executives everywhere, and startup founders working on the tech were suddenly the darlings of the VC world. (I see a lot of parallels with what’s going on with AI now, but at an even larger scale.) Fast-forward through the wave of consolidation and numerous failed startups, and by 2023 just a few well-funded giants remained, including GM’s Cruise, Alphabet’s Waymo, Hyundai-backed Motional, and Amazon-owned Zoox. In August 2023, Cruise finally received the last permit required to operate commercially in San Francisco. Hopes were high when I interviewed Vogt at Disrupt 2023, even as criticism over the robotaxis began ramping up. Everything changed on October 2 after an incident left a pedestrian stuck under and then dragged by one of its robotaxis. By the end of the year, Vogt had resigned , 24% of Cruise’s workforce had been laid off, regulators had suspended its permit , and the company decided to cease operations elsewhere. Recent moves by GM suggested that Cruise would return — albeit as a leaner, more tightly controlled enterprise. But GM chairman and CEO Mary Barra has different plans for Cruise. This story will be ongoing; there is much to dig into. But some of our initial articles cover GM’s decision , how Cruise employees learned about the change (the term “blindsided” was used), the financial effect on Honda ’s logical move to cut funding to a joint program in Japan. Stay tuned. And now on to other news. A little bird dropped an aviation tidbit regarding Hyundai ’s urban air mobility startup, Supernal that we were able to confirm with the company. The gist: Supernal is shifting global headquarters from Washington, D.C., to Irvine and is asking around three dozen of its workers to relocate . While that number represents only about 5% of its total workforce, it appears to account for the majority of workers located in Washington, according to data from LinkedIn and a source who spoke to TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity.

Take Archer Aviation Joby Aviation , two companies that went public via mergers with special acquisition companies. Archer raised $430 million from existing and new institutional investors to fund a new business unit dedicated to building aircraft for defense applications. In an interesting twist, part of that is going toward an exclusive partnership with Anduril to build a hybrid VTOL. Meanwhile, Joby launched a public offering to sell up to $300 million of its shares of common stock. That shouldn’t be confused with the $222 million Joby raised in October from underwriters. This latest filing adds to that offering and would give Joby the chance to raise a total of $522 million as it gears up to launch commercially in 2025. Other deals that got my attention … Nikola , a producer of battery and hydrogen-electric trucks, has taken several steps to repay its debts and raise equity, including offering up to $100 million in a common stock sale. WeaveGrid , a San Francisco-based startup that’s developed EV charging software, raised $28 million in a round led by Toyota’s Woven Capital. Existing investors Activate Capital, Collab Fund, Emerson Collective, and Salesforce Ventures participated, with debt provided by HSBC Innovation Banking. San Francisco is the most prepared city for new transportation technologies like AI, autonomous vehicles, and air taxis, according to a new urban mobility readiness index. Uber WeRide launched a robotaxi service in Abu Dhabi. Fisker resolved another federal safety investigation , this time over the risk that its Ocean SUVs roll away unexpectedly. You might recall an article I wrote in 2022 about Lightship , a startup building an all-electric travel trailer. Welp, the company has officially launched its production model, the AE.1 Cosmos Edition , formerly known as Lightship L1. The company plans to make only 50 units, which will cost $250,000. Three additional trim levels are expected in the future.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/03/tiktok-privacy-policy-update-china/,TikTok privacy update in Europe confirms China staff access to data as GDPR probe continues,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us An incoming privacy policy change announced by TikTok yesterday for users in Europe — which, for the first time, names China as one of several third countries where user data can be remotely accessed by “certain” company employees to perform what it claims are “important” functions — has landed months ahead of expected movement on a year+ long investigation into the platform’s data exports to China under the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR probe into the legality of the video sharing platform’s data transfers to China is being led by Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC), TikTok’s lead privacy regulator in the region, which opened the inquiry just over a year ago . The DPC told TechCrunch today that it expects its TikTok data transfers inquiry to progress to the next stage in the coming months — with a draft decision slated to be sent to other EU DPAs for review in the first quarter of next year. This ‘Article 60’ review process could lead either to an affirming of Ireland’s draft decision — which would then, in relatively short order, allow for a final decision to be issued (potentially before the middle of next year, judging by past inquiry timelines). However if other EU regulators raise objections to Ireland’s draft decision the inquiry would have to move to an ‘Article 65’ dispute resolution process — which could add many more months to the process before a final decision could be issued as the bloc’s regulators seek consensus. It’s not clear whether TikTok’s announcement of the privacy policy tweak relates to this overarching GDPR investigation. The incoming changes — which are due to apply from December 2 — do also include an update on how the platform collects users location information so they are not wholly focused on data transfers. But the disclosure of China staffers accessing European user data could also be a not-very-subtle attempt to preempt regulatory enforcement over its data transfers — and try to soften a future blow by being able to point to steps already taken to improve its transparency with European users. (Not that that is the only potential issue of regulatory concern vis-a-vis data exports, though.) A spokesman for TikTok declined to comment on whether its updated privacy policy is in any way linked to the GDPR inquiry — saying it could not do so as the inquiry remains ongoing. However in a blog post announcing the update, the company claimed the changes “include greater transparency into how we share user information outside of Europe”. That’s notable because transparency is a key principle of the GDPR — while infringements of the transparency principle can lead to stiff penalties (such as the $267M fine for Meta-owned WhatsApp last year , after an Ireland-led inquiry found a string of transparency breaches). Claiming you’re being transparent and actually being transparent are not necessarily the same thing, of course. So it’s worth noting that TikTok’s updated privacy policy appears to atomize key bits of information — such as the full list of countries where employees may remotely access European users’ data and for what specific reasons — across a number of collapsable menus and hyperlinks spread throughout the policy, thereby requiring a user to click around, follow multiple links and basically hunt for relevant intel amid a larger morass of data in order to piece together a comprehensive view of what’s happening with their data (rather than clearly articulating and collating everything into a single, easy to digest view). So, if it’s transparency TikTok is really shooting for here it still looks like it has work to do. Also still a work in progress for TikTok: A data localization project to store European users’ data in the region — which, earlier this year, it announced had been delayed again (until 2023). Thing is, if TikTok intends to continue to allow employees located in countries with no EU adequacy agreement affirming they have essentially equivalent data protection standards as the bloc to have remote access to European users’ information then questions over the legality of its international data transfers are likely to persist. As well as China, TikTok’s privacy policy names Brazil, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and the U.S. (which has only a preliminary agreement with the EU for a fresh data transfer agreement at the moment) as countries where employees have remote access to European user data without the cover of an adequacy agreement — saying it’s relying on standard contractual clauses (SCCs) for these transfers. But, as the EDPB guidance on data transfers points out, each transfer to a third country must be individually assessed and some may not be possible legally, even with supplementary measures applied. So every single one of these transfers will need to stand up to regulatory scrutiny. Given so many third country transfers, TikTok’s European data localization project can only — at least for now — be considered a PR exercise. And/or an attempt to curry favor with local regulators in the hopes they take a kinder view of ongoing data exports. Unless or until it ceases data exports to third countries and finds a way to fully firewall its parent entity in China from being able to access any European users’ data in the clear. TikTok’s spokesman declined to comment on any future plans it may have to further adapt its data transfers in light of these challenges but he pointed back to its — which describes its approach to data governance in Europe as being “centred on limiting the number of employees with access to European user data, minimising data flows outside of the region, and storing European user data locally.” TikTok’s wider problem is that it’s facing dialed up regulatory scrutiny across the Western world more generally as a result of security concerns attached to the Chinese state’s ability to gain access to data commercial platforms/services hold on their users — with national security laws in its home country overriding the usual standard contractual protections. Its platform also collects an awful lot of user data — which only fuels concerns about its capacity to be repurposed as a data honeypot for state surveillance or even for ‘soft power’ foreign influence ops. While its tracking and profiling of users invites further specific regulatory headaches in Europe — on the privacy and consumer protection side — which are applying some limits on how it can operate. For example, TikTok recently agreed to freeze a controversial change to the legal basis it relies upon to run targeting advertising after a formal warning from the Italian DPA — and some follow-up “engagement” from the DPC — over a plan to remove consent (and claim a legitimate interest to run targeted ads). So its profiling and ad targeting model is facing challenges on a number of fronts, even as it tries to defend its business against wider, geopolitical-related security concerns. After EU child safety complaints, TikTok tweaks ad disclosures but profiling concerns remain Topics Senior Reporter Natasha was a senior reporter for TechCrunch, from September 2012 to April 2025, based in Europe.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/09/meta-confirms-that-its-llama-3-open-source-llm-is-coming-in-the-next-month/,Meta confirms that its Llama 3 open source LLM is coming in the next month,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us At an event in London on Tuesday, Meta confirmed that it plans an initial release of Llama 3 — the next generation of its large language model used to power generative AI assistants — within the next month. This confirms a report published on Monday by The Information that Meta was getting close to launch . “Within the next month, actually less, hopefully in a very short period of time, we hope to start rolling out our new suite of next-generation foundation models, Llama 3,” said Nick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs. He described what sounds like the release of several different iterations or versions of the product. “There will be a number of different models with different capabilities, different versatilities [released] during the course of this year, starting really very soon.” The plan, Meta Chief Product Officer Chris Cox added, will be to power multiple products across Meta with Llama 3. Meta has been scrambling to catch up to OpenAI, which took it and other big tech companies like Google by surprise when it launched ChatGPT over a year ago and the app went viral, turning generative AI questions and answers into everyday, mainstream experiences. Meta has largely taken a very cautious approach with AI, but that hasn’t gone over well with the public, with previous versions of Llama criticized as too limited. (Llama 2 was released publicly in July 2023 . The first version of Llama was not released to the public, yet it still leaked online.) Llama 3, which is bigger in scope than its predecessors, is expected to address this, with capabilities not just to answer questions more accurately but also to field a wider range of questions that might include more controversial topics. It hopes this will make the product catch on with users. “Our goal over time is to make a Llama-powered Meta AI be the most useful assistant in the world,” said Joelle Pineau, vice president AI Research. “There’s quite a bit of work remaining to get there.” The company did not talk about the size of the parameters it’s using in Llama 3, nor did it offer any demos of how it would work. It’s expected to have about 140 billion parameters, compared to 70 billion for the biggest Llama 2 model. Most notably, Meta’s Llama families, built as open source products, represent a different philosophical approach to how AI should develop as a wider technology. In doing so, Meta is hoping to play into wider favor with developers versus more proprietary models. But Meta is also playing it more cautiously, it seems, especially when it comes to other generative AI beyond text generation. The company is not yet releasing Emu, its image generation tool, Pineau said. “Latency matters a lot along with safety along with ease of use, to generate images that you’re proud of and that represent whatever your creative context is,” Cox said. Ironically — or perhaps predictably (heh) — even as Meta works to launch Llama 3, it does have some significant generative AI skeptics in the house. Yann LeCun, the celebrated AI academic who is also Meta’s chief AI scientist, took a swipe at the limitations of generative AI overall and said his bet is on what comes after it. He predicts that will be joint embedding predicting architecture (JEPA), a different approach both to training models and producing results, which Meta has been using to build more accurate predictive AI in the area of image generation “The future of AI is JEPA. It’s not generative AI,” he said. “We’re going to have to change the name of Chris’s product division.” Topics Europe Editor Ingrid was a writer and editor for TechCrunch, from February 2012 through May 2025, based out of London.

GM said Tuesday it would cease funding Cruise and instead absorb the company and combine it with its own efforts to develop personal autonomous vehicles. While GM owns 90% of Cruise, Honda holds a small minority stake alongside other investors like T. Rowe Price and Microsoft. GM said it plans to buy back shares from minority stakeholders and increase its ownership stake to more than 97%. Honda, Cruise, and GM announced plans in October 2023 to launch a robotaxi service in Tokyo together in 2026 using Cruise’s purpose-built robotaxis, called The Origin. A few days later, Cruise lost its permits to operate in California and grounded its U.S. fleet after leadership mishandled communications of a safety incident with regulators. In January 2024, Honda’s CEO said he expected the Japanese automaker to debut AVs closer to the end of the decade. Seven months later, Cruise abandoned its plans to build the Origin robotaxi.

The new requirements cover areas such as how (and from whom) providers can procure infrastructure and services; how providers police activity and access; the investments they make into their security and data protection and the monitoring of that; how providers inform stakeholders of resulting data breaches or network outages; and more. The rules will start to get introduced in October, with carriers expected to fully implement new procedures by March 2024. Critically, those who fail to comply with the new regulations will face big fines: non-compliance can result in up to 10% of annual revenues; continuing contraventions will see fines of £100,000 ($117,000) per day. Communications regulator Ofcom, which worked with the National Cyber Security Centre to formulate the new regulations and code of practice, will enforce compliance and fines. The rules are the first big enforcement directives to come out of the Telecommunications (Security) Act , which was voted into law in November 2021. “We know how damaging cyber attacks on critical infrastructure can be, and our broadband and mobile networks are central to our way of life,” Digital Infrastructure Minister Matt Warman said in a statement. “We are ramping up protections for these vital networks by introducing one of the world’s toughest telecoms security regimes which secure our communications against current and future threats.” The emergence of the new security laws and enforcement process comes at a crossroads. On one hand, as security breaches continue to grow in scope and frequency, one of the most significant battlegrounds that has emerged in the fight against cybercrime has been network infrastructure — the mobile and broadband rails that all of our apps and devices need to function. For the most part broadband and mobile providers have set their own standards and processes, although the government today pointed out that a Telecoms Supply Chain Review that it carried out “found providers often have little incentive to adopt the best security practices.” On the other, there have been a number of breaches over the years that point not just to the sitting duck that is network infrastructure, but the failure to protect it. These have included incidents that threaten to reveal carriers’ source code ; exposure of lax security policies to gain network access; and creating targets out of their customers by not being stronger on security. The state of play was particularly laid bare a few years ago as 5G networks were starting to take shape, when there were question marks over not just how those networks would be secured, but whether the very equipment that was being procured — Chinese vendors being a key issue at the time that the legislation was first taking shape — was safe. The aim of the new rules is meant to be all-encompassing, covering not just how networks are being built and run, but the services that run on them. As the government lays out, they “protect data processed by their networks and services, and secure the critical functions which allow them to be operated and managed; protect software and equipment which monitor and analyze their networks and services; [require providers to] have a deep understanding of their security risks and the ability to identify when anomalous activity is taking place with regular reporting to internal boards; and take account of supply chain risks, and understand and control who has the ability to access and make changes to the operation of their networks and services to enhance security.” Notably the new laws do not lay out any specific names of companies, nor of countries, which gives the government license to change course, but might be seen as a way to further politicize the process. “We increasingly rely on our telecoms networks for our daily lives, our economy and the essential services we all use,” said NCSC Technical Director Dr Ian Levy in a statement. “These new regulations will ensure that the security and resilience of those networks, and the equipment that underpins them, is appropriate for the future.” Topics Europe Editor Ingrid was a writer and editor for TechCrunch, from February 2012 through May 2025, based out of London.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/31/mark-zuckerberg-defends-teenage-creators-right-to-public-instagram-accounts/,Mark Zuckerberg defends teenage creators’ right to public Instagram accounts,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and founder of Meta, commented in today’s Senate hearing on children’s online safety that teenagers should be able to be creators and share their content widely. Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI) questioned Zuckerberg about Meta’s privacy controls for teenagers. On Instagram, for example, teens under 16 — or 18 in some countries — have their accounts automatically set to private when they join the platform. But teenagers can toggle these safety measures to make their accounts public at any time. “Yes, we default teens into a private account so they can have a private and restricted experience,” Zuckerberg told the senator. “But some teens want to be creators and want to have content that they share more broadly, and I don’t think that’s something that should just blanketly be banned.” Research has shown that becoming a content creator is a dream for many young Americans. In 2019, Morning Consult reported that 86% of teens would consider trying to become an influencer, and that influencers held as much sway as traditional celebrities. For example, as many teens were familiar with the creator PewDiePie as they were with NBA legend LeBron James. When Lego surveyed 3,000 children in 2019, the toy company found that “vlogger” was a more popular dream job for kids than “astronaut.” Some of the most successful creators started out when they were teenagers, like 19-year-old Charli D’Amelio, a self-made millionaire whose family now has its own venture capital fund . MrBeast , another of the world’s highest earning creators, began posting on YouTube when he was 13. Of course, there are safety risks for these young creators, as well as any young person on the internet. But Zuckerberg affirms that their contributions to culture — and Meta’s bottom line — are worth it. For a business like Instagram, it’s important to keep talented creators happy on the platform so that their viral content continues to drive ad revenue. “There have been a lot of teens creating amazing things, and I think with the right supervision and parenting and controls . . . I don’t think that’s the type of thing that you want to not allow anyone to be able to do,” Zuckerberg said. Zuckerberg is one of five tech CEOs who testified before Congress about children’s online safety on Wednesday, including X’s Linda Yaccarino, Discord’s Jason Citron, Snap’s Evan Spiegel, and TikTok’s Shou Chew.

President Joe Biden introduced the tax credit under the bipartisan Inflation Reduction Act, but the incoming Trump administration is strongly considering cutting the program as part of broader tax reform. Newsom said he would propose a new version of California’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Project, which phased out in 2023, but funded more than 594,000 vehicles in its lifetime.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/11/instagram-kids-data-gdpr-decision/,Instagram faces big EU privacy decision on kids’ data within weeks,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A final decision on a complaint against Instagram’s handling of children’s data in the European Union is set to land within weeks, TechCrunch has learned, following the completion of a procedural mechanism to resolve regulatory disputes over how to enforce the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The enquiry about Instagram’s handling of kids’ data was opened by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), Meta’s lead data supervisor in the EU, back in September 2020. We’re told a final decision could come as soon as the end of this month (August 2022) — with a hard deadline of the first week of September for the DPC to issue the decision. The DPC’s deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, confirmed the decision has passed through the GDPR’s Article 65 dispute resolution process. “We got it back from the EDPB [European Data Protection Board] last week,” he told us, adding: “We’ll have a decision… either the end of the last week in August or the first week in September. It has to be concluded by the first week in September.” Details of what exactly the bloc’s data protection regulators have (collectively) concluded — and penalties Instagram will face, assuming they have found it breached the GDPR — are not being made public yet. But the DPC’s enquiry was opened after complaints Instagram was leaking the contact information of minors by letting them set up business accounts on its platform which made their contact information public by default. The GDPR bakes in a general expectation of privacy by design and default — and pays special attention when it comes to applying the standard to ensure the protection of children’s data. For the Instagram complaint, the DPC opted to open a so-called own volition enquiry, rather than acting solely on a specific complaint  — although it says its enquiry commenced after information was provided to it by a third party, as well as in connection with processing it had identified itself. The regulatory confirmed today that the scope of its enquiry covers the issue of the processing of children’s data for Instagram ‘business accounts’; and also a second element involving a user registration system the platform operated — which it found could lead to the accounts of child users being set to “public” by default, unless the user changed the account settings to set it to “private”. Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri recently announced that he would be temporarily relocating to Europe (London) this year. It’s not clear whether regulatory concerns factored into that decision but he will certainly be closer to policymakers who are making the most running when it comes regulating tech giants and social media . Last year , Meta announced it was ‘pausing’ development of a version of Instagram aimed at children under 13 after a major backlash over concerns about the platform’s mental health impact on teens.

As part of this pilot program, Meta says it will share “privacy-preserving social media data” with select academic researchers who study well-being. “At Meta, we want to do our part to contribute to the scientific community’s understanding of how different factors may or may not relate to people’s well-being. We’re committed to doing this in a way that respects the privacy of people who use our app,” said Curtiss Cobb, Meta’s VP of Research, in a press release. Academics have pushed for years to get platforms to share more data with them for their research, but as the impact of social media on mental health becomes an increasingly urgent concern in Congress, these efforts have accelerated. In November, Meta expanded researchers’ access to data through a transparency product called the Meta Content Library , which made already available data like public posts, comments and reactions easier to analyze at scale. On Wednesday, Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify before Congress alongside CEOs from Discord, Snap, TikTok and X as part of a hearing on children’s online safety. In addition to throwing academics a bone in advance of the hearing, Meta also announced last week that it’s rolling out new messaging restrictions on Facebook and Instagram, which will opt-out users under 16 from receiving messages from adults who they don’t follow. Guardians will also be able to approve or deny teens’ changes to default privacy settings. Meta has also taken some measures to limit teens’ access to content about self-harm, suicide and eating disorders. But these changes come amid escalating scrutiny. Earlier this month, unredacted documents in part of an ongoing lawsuit showed Meta’s “ historical reluctance ” to protect children on its platforms. Other social platforms have also been adopting new safety initiatives in the lead up to Wednesday’s hearing. X announced it will hire 100 moderators in Austin, Texas for a “Trust and Safety” center; per Axios , CEO Linda Yaccarino has also been meeting with bipartisan members of Congress to discuss how X is handling child sexual exploitation on the platform. Meanwhile, last week, X faced a high-profile content moderation issue when nonconsensual, pornographic deepfake images of Taylor Swift went viral. The public concern about the abusive images even reached the White House, where press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called on Congress to take legislative action.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/eplane-looks-to-ride-the-indian-governments-interest-in-air-taxis-with-new-14m-round/,ePlane looks to ride the Indian government’s interest in air taxis with new $14M round,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Soaring private vehicle ownership and declining use of public and nonmotorized transport have created mounting traffic congestion in India, the world’s most populous country, which also struggles with relatively narrower roads and inadequate parking facilities in cities. New Delhi recognizes these challenges and has been exploring new ways to address them quickly. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, at an event in September, said that air taxis will soon be a “reality in India,” indicating the government’s interest in supporting the new transportation mode. The country’s aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, also recently framed rules for vertiports to set the ground for air taxis. The ePlane Company is riding this wave. The startup, founded by IIT Madras aerospace engineering professor Satya Chakravarthy in 2019, is building its electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicle, the e200x, several months after developing unmanned drones for cargo and camera applications. Chakravarthy has a strong pedigree: He is also a co-founder and adviser at Indian space tech startups, including Agnikul and GalaxEye, and at an Indian hyperloop-focused startup, TuTr Hyperloop. Chakravarthy told TechCrunch that ePlane secured IPs in developing the intra-city commute and cargo-focused aircraft with reasonably slow fly speed and a compact wingspan of 8 meters, unlike typical air taxis with 12- to 16-meter wingspans. That will enable it to land in tighter spaces and make multiple short trips — up to 60 trips a day — on a single charge, he says. Commuters would reduce travel time by as much as 85%, at a cost of less than two times the fare they usually pay on an Uber ride, he claims. Most eVTOL vehicles currently are multicopters similar to commercial drones, including air taxis carrying spokes and vertical rotors. Chakravarthy said that while this configuration is easier to develop and implement in the market, it does not cover longer distances with a single battery charge. ePlane chose a lift-plus-cruise configuration where the vehicle carries a winged architecture just like a typical plane but with vertical rotors similar to a drone. “This configuration has been proven to actually be very reliable because we have redundancies in terms of the vertical rotors carrying the weight of the aircraft, while wings taken with their share of balancing the weight progressively so that we don’t have a loss of lift during the transition from a vertical takeoff and hover to forward flight,” he said. The startup has also developed technology called synergistic lift, which uses vertical rotors even in forward flight to make wings compact enough. Chakravarthy told TechCrunch that ePlane manufactures aircraft components at its IIT Madras facility, including airframe parts and designing seats and propellers. The startup outsources cells but assembles batteries for the aircraft at its facility to manage the aircraft’s center of gravity. The startup aims to commercialize its electric air taxi in the middle to second half of 2026 after securing the required certifications from the Indian and global authorities and prototyping the aircraft in the first half of 2025, Chakravarthy told TechCrunch. Ahead of testing the vehicle, ePlane has raised a $14 million Series B round co-led by Speciale Invest and Singapore’s Antares Ventures. The all-equity round also included participation from Micelio Mobility, Naval Ravikant, Java Capital, Samarthya Investment Advisors, Redstart (from Naukri), and Anicut. The round has valued the startup at $46 million post-money — over 2x its previous $21 million valuation. The fresh capital will help ePlane, which has a workforce of over 100 people, secure global regulatory certifications and boost its commercialization efforts. India’s success would help ePlane enter other markets, including the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Australia, and Europe. “We are working with a conviction that going forward, what’s good for India will be good for the world,” Chakravarthy said.

The Meta-owned messaging platform has been under investigation by the bloc following a series of consumer protection complaints lodged against it by the Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Network, led by Sweden’s national authority, back in July 2021 , following complaints by BEUC and a number of its member organizations, after WhatsApp had sought to enforce a controversial privacy policy update — leading to a major user backlash earlier that same year. Concern over WhatsApp’s updated ToS — separately — led a number of EU data protection agencies to issue their own earlier warnings There is some overlap in these respective regulatory concerns but the consumer protection complaints accuse WhatsApp of unfairly pressuring users to accept changes to its T&Cs and privacy policy, as well as objecting to a lack of clarity in its communiques to users — which watchdogs dub insufficient and confusing. The Commission said today it’s followed up a letter sent to WhatsApp about the consumer protection complaints back in January with a second letter urging the company to take action to address remaining concerns with its ToS and privacy policy updates; and to “clearly inform” consumers about its business model. “In particular, WhatsApp is asked to show how it plans to communicate any future updates to its terms of service, and to do so in a way that makes it easy for consumers to understand the implications of those updates and to freely decide whether they wish to continue using WhatsApp after those updates,” the Commission wrote in a statement in French [translated with machine translation]. “The company is also asked to clarify whether it derives revenue from commercial policies related to user data,” it added. The EU’s executive said WhatsApp responded to its earlier complaint letter by claiming it was providing users with “the necessary information” regarding the ToS updates, including through in-app notifications and its support center. But the Commission’s assessment is that WhatsApp’s comms is still not compliant — criticizing how the information is provided (“in an insistent manner”) and also still assessing it as “insufficient and confusing for users.” “WhatsApp must ensure that users understand what they are agreeing to and how their personal data is being used for commercial purposes, in particular to offer services to business partners,” added justice commissioner, Didier Reynders, in a statement. “I reiterate that I expect WhatsApp to fully comply with EU rules that protect consumers and their fundamental rights.” The Commission said WhatsApp has one month to demonstrate to consumer protection authorities across the bloc that its practices comply with EU consumer law. It’s not immediately clear what might happen if that deadline elapses without WhatsApp making the required changes but enforcement of consumer protection law is devolved to national agencies — and the Commission is essentially taking on a co-ordinating role here because it’s a cross border complaint. So the likely upshot of ongoing non-compliance is that WhatsApp risks receiving a series of enforcements at Member State level. Historically, the level of penalties available to national agencies to levy for consumer protection breaches has varied and can be low. However, in 2019, EU lawmakers backed a modernization of consumer protection rules to bring in more dissuasive penalties — especially for issues which cut across borders and affect many EU consumers, agreeing back then that for widespread infringements (as this issue would surely be judged, given how extensively WhatsApp is used in Europe) national authorities should be able to issue fines of at least up to 4% of global annual turnover. EU Member States were required to apply these new rules from May 28, 2022 — so, since WhatsApp is still being warned over consumer protection non-compliance in June 2022, the issue should fall under the beefed up regime, putting the company on the hook for what could be a meaty fine if it doesn’t clean up its act in time. We reached out to WhatsApp for comment on the Commission’s latest warning — and it sent this statement, attributed to a spokesperson: Our 2021 update did not change our commitment to user privacy or the way we operate our service, including how we process, use or share data with anyone, including Meta. We welcome the European Commission’s acknowledgement that we have provided users with the necessary information about our updates, including through in-app notifications and our help center. We are reviewing the letter from the CPC and will respond in due course. The company also pointed to a reorganization of its regional Privacy Policy it undertook earlier this year , following a major EU data protection sanction — when it also said it had added extra detail for people in the European region at the direction of its lead EU data protection regulator, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC). Data protection regulators have raised a number of similar concerns about WhatsApp’s operations — although the laws involved are distinct vs. consumer protection rules; and Ireland’s data protection regulator has long been accused of failing to vigorously enforce them against tech giants like WhatsApp’s parent, Meta. Last summer , following an intervention by other concerned EU data protection agencies, the European Data Protection Board ordered the DPC to swiftly investigate WhatsApp-Facebook data sharing — although it’s not clear how/whether it acted on that specific order. Last fall , the DPC did issue a $267 million fine against WhatsApp — for violations of the transparency principles of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — although that investigation dated back to December 2018, which long pre-dates the controversial privacy policy update that both consumer protection authorities and (other) EU data protection agencies have raised concerns about, even as Ireland has seemed content to accept Meta’s line that there’s been no meaningful change to its policies. Additionally, a very long running complaint against WhatsApp in the EU (dating back to May 2018 ) — which is focused on the crux issue of what is its legal basis for processing user data for ad targeting purposes — has yet to be decided, although we understand the DPC previously sent a draft decision to other EU DPAs for review (and the chance to object) so, at the time of writing, that standard GDPR Article 60 process of seeking consensus remains ongoing. A final decision on that four-year-old+ complaint could thus finally emerge later this year — with the possibility of another big penalty headed WhatsApp’s way. Or even an order to cease processing user data for ads which could have a far more damaging impact on Meta’s adtech business.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/03/uk-cma-amazon-meta-facebook-marketplace/,Meta and Amazon settle UK antitrust probes over use of third-party data to benefit marketplaces,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) today announced that it has accepted proposals from Facebook’s parent Meta and to limit how they use data gathered from their respective marketplaces to benefit their own products and bottom lines. The CMA has been probing both companies as part of separate investigations, though the cases bore similarities in terms of how each platform was using data to give them what the CMA argued was an “unfair advantage.” The crux of the case against Meta centered on how it was using advertising data funneled from Facebook to inform decisions around content displays and product recommendations in Facebook Marketplace, the classifieds service it launched back in 2016 . So in effect, Meta could use ad interaction data from Facebook to display more relevant items in users’ Marketplace feed, which, while arguably was beneficial to consumers, was detrimental to Facebook Marketplace competitors that use Facebook and other Meta platforms to advertise their products. The European Commission (EC) and the CMA announced separate but seemingly collaborative efforts to investigate Meta on this practice in June 2021, with the CMA confirming last August that it was proceeding with a formal investigation and the EC following suit shortly after . However, the CMA gave a strong indication in May that it was prepared to accept commitments from Meta to change its ways. This includes giving advertisers an opt-out in terms of preventing their advertising data being used by Meta in Facebook Marketplace, something that Meta has said it will develop a “technical solution” to achieve. As per the CMA’s final findings : Meta will implement technical systems to prevent the use of certain competitor advertising data in the operation of Facebook Marketplace and the development and/or improvement of the product design, layout and/or functionality of Facebook Marketplace. This technical solution will apply for advertisers who have voluntarily opted out of their advertising data being used, or who have been automatically opted out by Meta (and who have not objected to this). Most advertisers will still have to opt-out of their advertising data being used, meaning that Meta will still be able to leverage a lot of advertising data, such is the power of defaults . However, certain companies will be automatically opted-out, those that compete directly with Facebook Marketplace, as identified by Meta itself. These include Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Gumtree, Rightmove, Vinted and Zoopla. Additionally, Meta has said it will use “all reasonable endeavours” to prevent employees from using ad data in any product development, where it might give it an advantage over advertisers that use its platforms. It’s worth noting here that a consequence of Meta’s concessions, and the CMA’s acceptance, is that there has been no official ruling here on whether Meta has or hasn’t infringed on any antitrust regulations. Instead, the concessions have been offered at a relatively early stage of the investigation, prompting the CMA to terminate the investigation before it reached any conclusion. “These Commitments are without prejudice to Meta’s position that it has not infringed UK competition law and that the initial concerns that prompted the CMA to commence its Investigation are unfounded,” the CMA wrote. “Nothing in these Commitments can be construed as acceptance by Meta that its use of advertiser data could amount to an infringement of the Act (Competition Act 1998) or that Meta has a dominant position in any relevant market.” And while Meta’s commitments appear to be just that — commitments — the CMA has said it will set up a monitoring trustee to oversee its adherence, including its new technical system rollout and employee training. The CMA’s concurrent investigation into Amazon over similar data-abusing marketplace practices has also now come to an end. This comes more than a year after it first opened an investigation into whether the e-commerce giant was unfairly using data from third-party marketplace sellers to help Amazon itself decide which products to sell, manage supply-and-demand (stock levels) and set prices. Moreover, the CMA was also looking into whether Amazon favored its own products, or those that form part of the Fulfilled by Amazon ( FBA ) program, in terms of being featured in the prominent “ buy box ” section. “Data provided to the CMA by Amazon shows that where both Amazon Retail and third-party seller offers were eligible to be the Featured Offer on a product page in 2021, an offer by Amazon Retail was selected to be the Featured Offer in more than 80% of cases,” the CMA wrote. “The CMA has received complaints from third-party sellers which allege that the criteria for selecting the Featured Offer discriminate in favour of Amazon-fulfilled offers, including in circumstances where Amazon-fulfilled offers are less competitive on price.” Put simply, Amazon allegedly put its profits ahead of whatever might have been more beneficial to the customer, and as the platform-owner it put competing sellers at a disadvantage. As a result of all this, Amazon started making moves this summer to appease the CMA with several commitments of its own , which the CMA has now accepted. As per the CMA’s final report published today , Amazon has said that it will not use “non-public” data it holds on third-party sellers on Amazon’s marketplace, including anything related to payments of fulfilment services, for “decisions and decisional processes relating to retail operations by Amazon Retail that are in competition with third-party sellers.” This includes aggregated, individual and anonymized data. As for the “buy box,” Amazon said that will apply “objectively verifiable and non-discriminatory conditions and criteria for the purposes of determining the selection of the Featured Offer.” It also said that it won’t use any Prime labeling as part of the “buy box” featured offer. Finally, the CMA had also noted that third-party sellers that use courier services outside of Amazon’s own fulfilment services or Royal Mail were unable to independently negotiate rates for Prime delivery services with the carriers supplying those services — indeed, the sellers had to adhere to whatever rates Amazon had agreed with the carriers. Moving forward, Amazon said it will allow third-party sellers to negotiate their own rates with the carriers for Prime-eligible offers. Similar to the Meta case, the CMA’s approach to monitoring Amazon’s adherence to its commitments will involve setting up an “independent trustee” to oversee matters, something that will surely come with challenges — even if they get full unhindered cooperation from Amazon. Today’s announcement comes shortly after the CMA achieved some notable concessions from Microsoft to close its megabucks Activision acquisition , but the concessions in these latest cases are somewhat different and perhaps don’t really cut to the heart of the problem. That is, as platform-owners and data-harnessers, Meta and Amazon still hold too much sway. “We shouldn’t underestimate how difficult it is for regulators to get concessions from the Big Tech firms, and these concessions are sensible,” Tom Smith, a former CMA legal director who’s now partner at London-based law firm Geradin Partners, explained to TechCrunch. “However, neither of these cases touch the core business models of the firms. They are easy for the firms to live with, and their compliance will be extremely difficult to monitor.” Across the pond, meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Department of Justice are lining up their own antitrust cases against Amazon and Google respectively. And though they are at a less-advanced stage, they seem more extensive in scope, with attorneys general from 17 states alleging that Amazon has used a “set of interlocking anticompetitive and unfair strategies” to create a powerful monopoly. “The FTC’s Amazon case and the DOJ’s Google case are more ambitious in that regard,” Smith continued.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/vw-spinoff-scout-reveals-its-ev-vision-and-it-includes-a-model-with-a-gas-powered-generator/,VW spinoff Scout reveals its EV vision and it includes a model with a gas-powered generator,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Scout Motors, the Volkswagen Group spinoff , unveiled Thursday two EVs it hopes will hook American customers with modern-meets-rugged styling that downplays digital and embraces the mechanical. The catch? The company will also offer variants to its all-electric Scout Traveler SUV and Scout Terra Truck that will come equipped with a built-in gas-powered generator using a system called Harvester — a nod to the brand’s roots with the International Harvester Scout from the 1960s. If the idea of electric-meets-gas-generator sounds familiar, it is. Stellantis brand Ram unveiled last year the Ramcharger , a battery electric truck equipped with a 3.6-liter V6 engine and on-board 130 kilowatt generator that, when combined, promises a targeted range of 690 miles. The Scout EVs — a truck and an SUV  — won’t arrive until 2027. The new brand that launched two years ago was initially slated to produce the vehicles in 2026. When they do finally go into production, the vehicles will have a body-on-frame chassis, solid rear axle, and front and rear mechanical lockers as well as a powertrain that will deliver 1,000 pound-feet of torque and a zero to 60 mph acceleration of 3.5 seconds (in certain trims). Those specific automotive details are foundational to what Scout hopes will resonate with buyers: new tech-forward EVs with off-road and on-road performance that also delivers nostalgia and memories of real buttons and switches. And while there are in fact buttons inside the vehicles, there is also a central touchscreen. Scout Motors president and CEO Scott Keogh, who kicked off the reveal, seemed keenly aware of the challenges facing the auto industry, not to mention this new brand that was named after the iconic International Harvester Scout that came to market in the early 1960s. “These, without a doubt, are complicated times,” he said at an event that was livestreamed. “Industries are facing labor tensions, unease about the shift to EVS, infrastructure, geopolitical uncertainty, inflation, supply chains, the need to get software done right, digital trust and, of course, return on investment.” In Keogh’s view, the two new Scout EVs will circumvent these challenges. The company said Thursday the fully electric models are expected to offer up to 350 miles of range. The EVs will also be equipped with Tesla’s North American Charging Standard. But in a twist that suggests Scout wants to hedge its bets, the company will also offer extended range variants with more than 500 miles of range made possible through a built-in gas-powered generator. Keogh was quick to note that the gas-powered generator version called Harvester is “still a Scout.” “All of that great ability, all of that capability, all that recognition, nothing goes away when you get the range extender,” he said, adding that it is still an EV. “You still have the frunk, you still have all the packaging, and the battery will drive both of the axles, of course, the engine will power the battery. So this gives you a proper EV experience with, of course, the generator.” He also noted that the Harvester model future-proofs the brand, which is “critical for us in these times.” Regardless of the powertrain, the EV platform will offer up to 35-inch tires, more than one foot of ground clearance and nearly 3 feet of water fording capability, a front sway bar disconnect, front and rear mechanical lockers, competitive approach and departure angles, and robust suspension options, according to Scout. All of these details are part of that rugged messaging Scout hopes will appeal to customers. The company also said the Terra truck will be able to tow more than 10,000 pounds while the Traveler SUV will be able to handle 7,000 pounds. No word on how that will affect the vehicles’ range. The guts of both of these EVs will include what Scout describes as a modern zonal architecture, that allows for over-the-air software updates and remote diagnostics. Scout’s parent company VW has struggled to deliver this kind of software performance in its vehicles despite the creation of a 6,000-person-plus subsidiary called Cariad that is dedicated to exactly that. Recently, Volkswagen Group agreed to invest $1 billion into EV startup Rivian as part of a broad software development deal that could expand to as much as $5 billion. It’s possible, and probable even, that the joint venture will lend a software hand to Scout as well. The interior continues with the theme of new-meets-old. The touchscreen is front and center, but toggles and knobs, which are used to control the air-conditioning and heating, are located right below it. There is even a compass on the ceiling near the rearview mirror. One detail that embraces the International Harvester roots is the option to eschew the multifunctional console for a front row bench seat. “Americans have not forgotten how to do things like open a car door, like turn a knob, like pull a switch, so I promise you all sorts of functionality to let Americans stay functional and keep doing things themselves,” Keogh said in a slight dig at numerous modern EVs. The Scout Traveler and Terra models will have an entry price under $60,000. Scout noted those prices could be as low as $50,000 with available incentives. That’s assuming that incentives laid out in the Inflation Reduction Act remain. Scout is poised to capture those incentives since it will design the vehicles in Michigan and build them at a new $2 billion factory capable of producing 200,000 EVs a year in South Carolina. Scout is also taking the controversial step of selling its EVs directly to consumers, which would avoid using VW dealerships. The company said potential customers can make a reservation to order a Scout Traveler SUV or Scout Terra truck for a refundable $100.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/14/dpc-sued-google-rtb-complaint/,Ireland’s privacy watchdog sued for inaction over ‘massive Google data breach’,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Ireland’s evasive response to a major security complaint filed against Google’s adtech the year the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into application is the target of a new lawsuit that accuses the Data Protection Commission (DPC) of years of inaction over what the complainants assert is “the largest data breach ever.” Today local press in Ireland reported that the Irish High Court has agreed to hear the suit. The litigation has been prepared by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL), whose senior fellow, Johnny Ryan, is named as the plaintiff. At issue is the DPC’s response to a long-running complaint about Google’s role in the high-velocity trading of web users’ personal data to determine which ads get served — and, more specifically, the lack of attention the data-trading systems of the tracking-based advertising industry pay to security. (Security, of course, is a key principle of the EU’s flagship data protection regime.) The ICCL’s suit thus accuses the DPC of a failure to act on what it couches as a “massive Google data breach.” Conservative estimate: Google does this billions of times, every day. This is the biggest data breach ever recorded. (See estimate from Texas AG et al. v Google, p. 2 https://t.co/2ehG69zVKy ) pic.twitter.com/pv9uJpu6EH — Johnny Ryan (@johnnyryan) March 14, 2022 Ryan will be familiar to anyone who’s been following adtech’s mounting legal woes in Europe as the driving force behind a series of complaints and lawsuits, since 2018, targeting the high-velocity trading of people’s data for real-time ad auctions (real-time bidding, or RTB). A former adtech insider turned whistleblower, Ryan has amped up pressure on the industry for reform through a series of strategic GDPR complaints. But, more recently, his complaints have increasingly targeted the DPC itself. In September 2020 , for example, he published a dossier of evidence highlighting how the online ad-targeting industry profiles internet users’ intimate characteristics without their knowledge or consent — calling out the DPC for ongoing inaction over the RTB security complaint. He has also lodged a complaint with the European Commission that led to an ombudsperson stepping in to look into the EU’s own high-level monitoring of the (decentralized) application of the GDPR, which relies upon agencies in each member state to do the graft of investigating and enforcing violations of the law. On the 2018 Google adtech complaint, the DPC has — so far — announced some procedural steps. Following Ryan’s original September 2018 complaint, which named both Google and the online ad industry body the IAB Europe (two key players in the RTB system), Ireland opened a formal inquiry into Google’s adtech in May 2019. The regulator is the lead EU watchdog for Google. However, Ireland did not open an inquiry based on the substance of Ryan’s complaint; rather, it opened what’s known as an “own-volition inquiry” — saying it would seek to “establish whether processing of personal data carried out at each stage of an advertising transaction is in compliance with the relevant provisions of the GDPR, including the lawful basis for processing, the principles of transparency and data minimisation, as well as Google’s retention practices,” as it put it at the time. Notably, the DPC did not say its inquiry would interrogate Google’s role in RTB through a security lens — despite the core of Ryan’s complaint being that a system that “functions” by broadcasting highly sensitive data about people (browsing habits, device IDs, location, etc.), across the internet to intermediaries, with no way for the tracked users to control who receives their information or what gets done with it, is the opposite of secure. So that’s what Ryan, via the ICCL, is now pressing for: The lawsuit aims to force Ireland to investigate the security of RTB, an issue the regulator has so far seemed keen to avoid. While RTB has faced a number of other GDPR complaints, in relation to issues like the legal basis for processing people’s data in the first place, Ryan’s complaint intentionally zeroed in on security as it seemed to offer the clearest route to demonstrating that something was very rotten in the state of adtech, as he explained to TechCrunch back in 2018 . “I’m trying to be as efficient as possible with every bit of litigation that we launch,” Ryan tells us now. “For 3.5 years I have asked the Irish Data Protection Commission to investigate and act on the biggest data breach ever recorded. And it has not done so and as a result of that, every European has been exposed to this.” “The DPC is really good at muddying things,” he adds. “This is a really nice, crisp, clear example of the DPC having Europe-wide responsibility for a really big issue that affects everybody — everyone — and it’s not some small thing. And they haven’t done anything. So there isn’t really any thing that I could do — we have to sue them.” “If they don’t act on this, they may as well not exist,” he concludes. “ We are concerned that the rights of individuals across the EU are in jeopardy, because the DPC has failed to investigate Google’s RTB system over three and half years since first notified by Johnny Ryan in 2018. The issue at stake here affects the rights of every European and we are going to court to see that digital rights are protected. Repeated attempts to get the DPC to take up this rights violation have failed.” Last month , a flagship ad industry framework that was also targeted in complaints attached to RTB, the IAB Europe’s Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) — which is routinely served to web users in the form of a “privacy choices” pop-up, asking people to consent to their data to be used for ad-targeting in real-time ad auctions — was found by Belgium’s data protection authority to be in breach of the GDPR. (As was the IAB itself.) The IAB has been given a few months to find a fix for a very long list of violations — and some privacy experts argue this is likely an impossible task, given the systemic violations the TCF plugs into (and for which RTB is the core aim). Behavioral ad industry gets hard reform deadline after IAB’s TCF found to breach Europe’s GDPR The Belgian authority was acting on similar RTB complaints to Ryan’s that had been filed locally. (The IAB is overseen by Belgium’s regulator, so Ireland would not be expected to lead on that branch of his complaint. However, Ryan also accuses Ireland of failing to pass on his original complaint to Belgium as the GDPR’s one-stop-shop mechanism would surely intend.) The laundry list of failures identified by the Belgian DPA with regards to the IAB’s TCF very much features security — with breaches of the security of processing, integrity of personal data, data protection by design and default among those listed in its final decision earlier this year. Yet, despite security being clearly identified as a problem with a flagship industry framework that plugs into RTB (and, more than that, is intended to feed the system as a key strategic piece of adtech apparatus), the DPC’s still ongoing investigation of Google’s adtech — using its own terms of reference — does not mention “security.” In a timeline chronicling what the ICCL’s press release couches as “3 ½ years of inaction,” the civil liberties organization writes that on January 12 of this year the regulator finally said it had written a “statement of issues” of what it will investigate, vis-a-vis the Google complaint, but that statement “excludes data security — the critical issue of the complaint.” It’s not clear why the DPC has chosen to carve out security from its probe of Google’s adtech. Its plentiful critics would surely have thoughts on that. (Ryan says he has “no idea about their motives” when asked for a view — suggesting “many people see conspiracy where there is merely cock-up” and “we do not know why there is this persistent inertia” — hence “that’s why we need an independent review.”) Reached for comment on the ICCL’s lawsuit, deputy commissioner Graham Doyle declined wider remarks — saying only that there’s “not much to say at this stage beyond the fact that our investigation is progressing.” Ireland’s data protection regulator continues to attract trenchant criticism over its circuitous (some might say labyrinthine) approach to GDPR enforcement — especially in regards to cross-border complaints against major tech giants like Google and Facebook. Civil society, consumer protection and digital and privacy rights groups, and individual experts have all blasted the regulator for years for dragging its feet — or simply avoiding — properly investigating a string of major complaints and concerns, from systemic privacy and consent abuses to location tracking violations or indeed RTB’s massive security question, even though these are the sorts of systemic issues which, if confirmed by investigation, implicate massive consumer harms that scale right across the bloc. That also means these are the sorts of complaints that, were they to actually be enforced, could force wholesale reform of certain types of privacy-hostile data-mining business models. It’s notable that the handful of final decisions the DPC has issued against tech giants to date, since the GDPR began being applied in May 2018, have had to go through an objection resolution process baked into the regulation — after other EU data protection agencies rejected Ireland’s preference for lesser penalties. (See its 2020 security breach decision against Twitter and its 2021 transparency decision against WhatsApp .) A draft DPC decision against Facebook that was made public by the complainant (against the DPC’s wishes) last fall also looks laughably lenient. (That complainant also filed a criminal complaint against the regulator in November — accusing the DPC of using “procedural blackmail” to try to gag it.) It’s not clear how quickly the ICCL lawsuit against the DPC might progress and potentially accelerate Ireland’s GDPR enforcement of adtech. That may depend upon which of Ireland’s courts chooses to hear it. The regulator has faced a number of other legal challenges to its processes in recent years — including a couple in relation to a long-running complaint against Facebook’s EU-U.S. data transfers, one component of which it settled in January 2021 by agreeing to swiftly resolve the complaint. (However, a final decision on that issue is still pending.) The U.K.’s Information Commissioner’s Office, meanwhile, has also faced criticism over adtech inaction and litigation over RTB complaints starting in late 2020, after it closed a similar complaint without taking any enforcement action against the adtech industry (despite publicly acknowledging systemic lawlessness). In that case, the legal action only went to a tribunal, which ultimately decided it lacked the jurisdiction to assess the validity of the outcome the ICO had claimed (but which the plaintiffs had sought to challenge). A suit against the DPC that’s heard in court should not face such powers-based uncertainties — so if the ICCL and Ryan prevail in their arguments, the Irish regulator could face an order to investigate the security of Google’s adtech that it can’t simply ignore; it would be forced to enforce a security-minded cleanup of adtech. Which is quite a thought. Google did not respond to a request for comment on the ICCL lawsuit.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-livestream-to-instagram-and-facebook/,Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses livestream to Instagram and Facebook,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The original Ray-Ban Stories didn’t catch on quite like Meta had hoped. According to a recent report , the company managed to sell a bit over one-third of what the internal 300,000 unit goal it set for the first seven months the device was on sale. Perhaps even more damning is a section from the same report suggesting that around 90% of owners had already abandoned the hardware. As always, there’s a lot at play here, but I suspect a big part of the disappointment can be traced back to the system’s limitations. For one thing, the Stories couldn’t stream video — a pretty key feature one hopes for when it comes to sunglasses with embedded cameras. I certainly won’t go so far as to suggest that the forthcoming Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are destined to be a runaway hit, but I will tell you that at the very least its creators addressed the biggest issue with their predecessor. Unveiled this morning at Meta Connect in Menlo Park, California, the new sunglasses are capable of livestreaming video to (naturally) Facebook and Instagram. The systems come in the standard classic Wayfarer design, along with a new Headliner style. They look like standard sunglasses (or eyeglasses, depending on the lens), save for two round modules on the side of either eye. On the right is a 12-megapixel camera that can take stills and record video in 1080p. The other side — that looks more or less identical (for symmetry’s sake) — is actually an LED light that flips on to alert others that you’re recording. It’s a nice feature, given how relatively inconspicuous these things are. Without a light, it would honestly be pretty easy to record people without their knowledge (please don’t do this). While Meta says they didn’t receive any reports of the small group of people who bought the glasses uses them for nefarious purposes, it’s instituted a fail-safe here. If you cover the light with, say, black tape, you’ll get a message telling you to remove it. Also, the system won’t take photos or record in this state. The Ray-Ban Meta features open-ear speakers (not bone conduction) that are capable of getting 50% louder than their predecessors. We got our hands on some pairs at a recent Meta event, and I can attest to the fact that they can get to a comfortably loud volume. Something worth caveating all of this, of course, is the fact that we tested them in ideal conditions. I point that out because, while open-ear headphones are better in terms of situational awareness, there’s no passive cancellation. That means they’re competing with a lot of ambient sound and can be difficult to hear in loud environments. Unfortunately, there’s no way to, say, pair some AirPods directly to the glasses. Instead, you’ll have to rely on the built-in hardware to listen to music and take calls. There are more than 150 design combos possible, when you factor in all of the different design options, including frame color, style and lenses (including sunglasses, clear, prescription, transitions and polarized). There’s also a transparent option for the frames, offering a peek at the technology behind it. Perhaps we’re due for a see-through tech comeback, on the heels of Nothing’s devices. The Ray-Ban Meta are up for preorder starting today in the following markets: U.S., Canada, U.K., Ireland, Italy, France, Spain, Belgium, Austria, Australia, Germany, Norway, Finland, Denmark and Sweden. They go on sale October 12 from Meta, LensCrafters, Amazon and Best Buy. The price starts at $299 for standard lenses. Polarized run $329 and transitions $379. Prescription lenses are on a sliding scale. Topics Brian Heater was the Hardware Editor at TechCrunch until early 2025.

The Cybercab, which Tesla is pitching as the future of autonomous transport , was revealed to be a two-seater that could be purchased for less than $30,000. Then, in a surprise reveal, CEO Elon Musk showed off the larger Robovan for transporting up to 20 people . And Anthony Levandowski, who co-founded Google’s self-driving car program, broadly supported Musk’s visions in a post-event interview . Check out the full archive of the event below, which is set to skip the 53 minutes of techno that preempted the actual event, or go back and follow along with our live blog from Thursday Tesla loves to put on a show, and Thursday’s Robotaxi reveal might just be the flashiest of them all. The electric vehicle maker is slated to unveil its much-hyped Robotaxi vehicle at Warner Bros. Discovery’s movie studio in Burbank, California. For those attending, doors will open at 5 p.m. PT, with remarks beginning at 7 p.m. PT today. Tesla will livestream the “We, Robot” event on X , which Musk owns, and on the automaker’s usually streams events live on its YouTube page . The YouTube backup is a smart option, considering the technical issues X’s livestreams have faced. And you can follow along with our own live blog of the event here Musk first teased the Robotaxi event in April, setting a date of August 8 for a reveal — a date that Tesla had to push back due to “an important design change to the front.” The Robotaxi appears to have come at the expense of a next-generation $25,000 EV that Musk also promised. A few weeks after Musk announced the Robotaxi event, he slashed more than 10% of Tesla’s workforce and said the automaker was going “ balls to the wall for autonomy.” Musk has promised autonomous capabilities in Tesla vehicles for years. The company’s advanced driver-assistance system is rather brazenly named Full Self-Driving (FSD), even though it is not fully self-driving and requires a human driver to pay attention and take over if needed — a fact that is borne out again and again in drive-along videos that fans regularly post on social media. When Musk first floated the idea of robotaxis in 2019 , the idea was that some existing Teslas would be able to act as autonomous robotaxis with only software updates, potentially unlocking an opportunity for Tesla owners to make money from their cars when not driving them. That plan, which was supposed to result in millions of robotaxis on the road by 2020, has never been implemented. At the time, Musk said that in places where there aren’t enough people to share their cars, Tesla would provide a dedicated fleet of robotaxis. We expect this reveal — which we remind you is at a Hollywood studio — to be less about the autonomous technology and more about the vehicle itself. Musk has said he wants to build a robotaxi without a steering wheel or pedals, and images of the vehicle that were included in Walter Isaacson’s Elon Musk biography, which was published in 2023, reveal a Cybertruck-inspired, two-door, two-seater compact vehicle. Whatever the event brings, TechCrunch will be following it live and bringing you the news as it happens, so stay tuned. This post has been updated following the conclusion of Tesla’s We, Robot event.

Japanese boutique robotics firm Yukai Engineering returns to CES with Fufuly, which follows in Qoobo’s footsteps by quite literally breathing some life into a cushion. The hardware startup says the product utilizes “respiratory entrainment,” which refers to a phenomenon wherein the rhythm of a user’s breathing matches that of a respirator. That basically means the person’s breathing matches up with the robot cushion, rather than the other way around. Yukai says the product was developed based on research from the University of Tokyo. Certainly plenty has been written about the power of breathing in improving one’s mental state and reducing anxiety. It’s precisely the reason breathing is tied so closely to meditation, for example. There’s no app, and really, not much in the way of smarts here (and unlike Qoobo, it doesn’t directly respond to user stimulus). Instead, you cycle through three modes: regular, deep, and third designed to help the user relax. Per the Fulfuly website [translated from the Japanese], “It’s very easy to use. Switch it on and hug it. This is all you need.” If only the rest of life could be so simple. Like past Yukai products, the pillow will be launched via a crowdfunding campaign. No word on pricing as of yet, though CEO Shunsuke Aoki tells me that the product will likely cost more than Qoobo, which is currently priced a bit north of $100. Also new for the show is Lightony, a robotic lamp designed to “doze off” with the user. Topics Brian Heater was the Hardware Editor at TechCrunch until early 2025.

The bill, the Banning Surveillance Advertising Act , introduced by Reps. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) and Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) in the House and Cory Booker (D-NJ) in the Senate, would dramatically limit the ways that tech companies serve ads to their users, banning the use of personal data altogether. Any targeting based on “protected class information, such as race, gender, and religion, and personal data purchased from data brokers” would be off-limits were the bill to pass. Platforms could still target ads based on general location data at the city or state level and “contextual advertising” based on the content a user is interacting with would still be allowed. The bill would empower the FTC and state attorneys general to enforce violations, with fines of up to $5,000 per incident for knowing violations. “The ‘surveillance advertising’ business model is premised on the unseemly collection and hoarding of personal data to enable ad targeting,” Rep. Eshoo said. “This pernicious practice allows online platforms to chase user engagement at great cost to our society, and it fuels disinformation, discrimination, voter suppression, privacy abuses, and so many other harms.” Today I introduced the Banning Surveillance Advertising Act with @RepAnnaEshoo and @RepSchakowsky . With this act, advertisers will be forced to stop exploiting individuals’ online behavior for profits and our communities will be safer as a result. — Sen. Cory Booker (@SenBooker) January 19, 2022 Sen. Booker called the targeted advertising model “predatory and invasive,” stressing how the practice exacerbates misinformation and extremism on social media platforms. Privacy-minded companies including search engine maker DuckDuckGo and Proton, creator of ProtonMail, backed the legislation along with organizations including the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), the Anti-Defamation League, Accountable Tech and Common Sense Media.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/25/metas-threads-app-is-rolling-out-a-following-feed/,Meta’s Threads app is rolling out a Following feed,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Meta’s text-based social network Threads is rolling out one of the most requested features after its launch — a Following feed. The company has also announced the ability to see posts you’ve liked in your settings, which will be available soon. You’re able to either hide or show the For You and Following feeds by tapping on the Threads icon at the top of the app’s screen. In addition, the update includes new categories to sort your Activity feed, allowing you to filter by Follows, Quotes and Reposts, and a new Follow button on your followers list to easily follow other accounts back, Instagram tells TechCrunch. Plus, users with private accounts can now approve follow requests in one go with a new “approve all” option. Soon, users will also gain the ability to see posts they’ve liked in their settings, we’re told. In a post on his Instagram Channel, Mark Zuckerberg said that the company is adding translation features as well. “Threads started rolling out an option for a chronological feed of only people you’re following and added translations too. More to come!” he wrote. Users will need to be on the latest version of the Threads app to get these new features. However, because this is a gradual roll-out, you might not see the new feed or the other options immediately. The company said that translations are automatic based on the language they are written in and the user’s language settings. On Threads, Zuckerberg quoted a user’s post about a Following feed and said “Ask and you shall receive.” The placement of the “For You” and “Following” feeds appear on the top of the app — just like Twitter, we should note. That will make it easier for those leaving Twitter to get used to Threads’ app. Update your Threads app. The following tab is here. Might be time to eXit soon. pic.twitter.com/T2QRzZQdVU — Corner Taken Quickly ORIGI (@CrnrTknQckOrigi) July 25, 2023 In response to a user complaint that the new Following tab would only load a handful of posts, Threads iOS developer Cameron Roth noted the company is looking into the bug, adding “Seems we have created a lot of sudden demand for some reason…” Threads has been moving fast to update its app, in the wake of Twitter’s stumbles. It recently released its first major update since its launch , bringing support for iOS 17 , now available as a public beta, among other smaller changes. It then rolled out another update that was meant to bring translation support and more. But that update had been temporarily paused to sort out some issues. Still ahead for Threads are larger improvements like an edit button, multi-account support and integration with ActivityPub, the protocol powering the popular, decentralized Twitter alternative Mastodon. As Instagram head Adam Mosseri dubbed it, Threads is still “a work in progress.” Shortly after its launch, Instagram Threads became an overnight success, topping 100 million users within days of its arrival, though usage numbers have since declined . A Wall Street Journal article on Friday warned that Instagram’s new Twitter competitor had begun losing steam. Citing third-party data from Sensor Tower, the paper reported the number of daily active users on Threads dropped for the second week down to 13 million, a 70% decline from a July 7 high point. By comparison, Twitter’s daily active users are around 200 million. But it’s too early to count Threads out just yet . According to data.ai , the app has already achieved one-fifth of the weekly active user base of Twitter. The addition of the in-demand Following feed feature may help to once again boost Threads’ usage numbers which had dropped following the app’s blowout debut. The launch of the new chronological feed comes as Elon Musk removed the bird logo from Twitter and replaced it with an ‘X’ on Monday. Musk said that the company plans to “bid adieu to the Twitter brand” in the near future. However, the transition is not going smoothly, as most of the official handles and many parts of the website continue to feature the “Twitter” branding. Meta once again is cleverly taking advantage of the chaos at Twitter, er X, to lure users to its Twitter clone. As X seems to be in flux, proclaiming a future that involves payments, banking and video , among other things, those who want a more classic Twitter experience may find themselves trying Threads instead.

The chaos was described in a new filing that was submitted to Fisker’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy docket Friday afternoon by landlord Shamrock Properties II, LLC. Tony Lenzini, a representative for Shamrock, said in an attached declaration that the landlord “now faces tens of thousands of dollars in cleanup costs, damage repairs, and what appears to me to be hazardous waste removal.” Shamrock is now objecting to Fisker’s attempt to abandon the lease because of the mess that’s been left behind. Shamrock says Fisker sold some of the on-site assets to Heritage Global Partners, an auction house, but that it hasn’t been able to determine who legally owns any of the stuff that was left behind. A lawyer for Fisker did not respond to a request for comment. The filing comes as Fisker is trying to get its liquidation plan confirmed four months after filing for bankruptcy. That could happen as soon as next week. The bankrupt company has gotten support from its myriad creditors, although the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed an objection earlier Friday, revealing that it has opened an investigation into Fisker . Lenzini says in his declaration that representatives for Fisker accompanied him on a walkthrough of the facility, which is located in La Palma, California, on September 24. (Fisker shifted its headquarters to this facility after it closed its shiny main Manhattan Beach office in May .) He says they assured him that Heritage Global Partners “would have everything removed” by September 27 — the date Fisker was slated to hand over the property — and that “the building would be cleaned as thoroughly has [sic] possible.” Over those few days, though, Lenzini describes a manic scramble. He says people were “pulling items out of the office and warehouse and loading up trucks and cars” and claims no one was logging what was taken. Meanwhile, HPG president Nick Dove tells TechCrunch that his firm, which purchased some office equipment, furniture, and related items, had an agreement with Fisker that was supposed give them access until September 30. However, the company and its moving crew wasn’t allowed into the building September 30 to retrieve those items. He also says the “chemicals and batteries were not part of our transaction” with Fisker. On September 27, Lenzini says he “witnessed people hurriedly removing property from the building and loading vehicles with various items” but adds that he had “no idea who these people were — whether they were Fisker employees, HGP, Huron staff, or friends of either.” (Huron is the name of the consulting group that has advised Fisker through the bankruptcy process.) Lenzini says these people were “throwing debris everywhere, taking tools, computers, automotive parts, and more, and then returning for another load.” And yet, Lenzini says, the La Palma facility “has been left in complete disarray.” He says there are two 50- to 55-gallon drums, one that references containing oil and another that says it contains coolant. He says there are “approximately 20 automotive sized batteries” left on-site, too. It isn’t clear if those are electric vehicle battery packs or more typical 12-volt car batteries. Lawyers for Shamrock wrote that Fisker vehicles “were left parked” in the lot outside the facility, but did not specify if they are Ocean SUVs. “My concern is that I do not know what chemicals have been left at La Palma,” Lenzini writes. Photos attached to Lenzini’s declaration show full-size clay models of Fisker’s planned Ronin supercar and Alaska pickup truck, and an office full of tipped-over garbage cans and detritus. In addition to all this, lawyers for Shamrock claim people have broken into the facility and have been “attempting to set up residence when the Premises were left vacant and not secured.” Topics Sr. Reporter, Transportation LIMITED TIME: Save $300+ on your ticket, plus an additional 50% on a second for a full immersive day of AI!

The government agency announced that it’s going to launch a new streaming service later this year called NASA+. The ad-free, no-cost streaming service will include live coverage of future launches, documentaries and new original series that will be exclusively available on the platform. “We’re putting space on demand and at your fingertips with NASA’s new streaming platform,” said Marc Etkind, NASA’s associate administrator of communications, in a statement. “Transforming our digital presence will help us better tell the stories of how NASA explores the unknown in air and space, inspires through discovery, and innovates for the benefit of humanity.” NASA+ will be available via the NASA app on iOS and Android mobile and tablet devices, along with streaming media players such as Roku, Apple TV and Fire TV. The streaming service will also be accessible on the web via the agency’s new beta website . The new web experience will be home to information about the agency’s missions and research, climate data, Artemis updates and more. The updated nasa.gov and science.nasa.gov websites will provide a topic-driven experience, with a common search engine and integrated navigation. The agency currently uses NASA TV for its video content and launch streams. It runs a 24/7 slate of content on both the NASA site and YouTube. By launching its own streaming service, NASA is creating a dedicated space for viewers to access its content. NASA CIO Jeff Seaton said in a press release that modernizing the agency’s main websites and streamlining how the public engages with its content online are the first steps toward making NASA’s information “more accessible, discoverable and secure.” It’s unknown what the streaming service will look like, but given that the agency says it’s focusing on modernizing and streamlining its content, we will likely see an interface that is similar to those that we have become accustomed to with other streaming services.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/austrian-dpa-schrems-ii/,"In bad news for US cloud services, Austrian website’s use of Google Analytics found to breach GDPR",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A decision by Austria’s data protection watchdog upholding a complaint against a website related to its use of Google Analytics does not bode well for use of US cloud services in Europe. The decision raises a big red flag over routine use of tools that require transferring Europeans’ personal data to the US for processing — with the watchdog finding that IP address and identifiers in cookie data are the personal data of site visitors, meaning these transfers fall under the purview of EU data protection law. In this specific case, an IP address “anonymization” function had not been properly implemented on the website. But, regardless of that technical wrinkle, the regulator found IP address data to be personal data given the potential for it to be combined — like a “puzzle piece” — with other digital data to identify a visitor. Consequently the Austrian DPA found that the website in question — a health focused site called netdoktor.at, which had been exporting visitors’ data to the US as a result of implementing Google Analytics — had violated Chapter V of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which deals with data transfers out of the bloc. “US intelligence services use certain online identifiers (such as the IP address or unique identification numbers) as a starting point for the surveillance of individuals,” the regulator notes in the decision [via a machine translation of the German language text], adding: “In particular, it cannot be excluded that these intelligence services have already collected information with the help of which the data transmitted here can be traced back to the person of the complainant.” In reaching its conclusion, the regulator assessed various measures Google said it had implemented to protect the data in the US — such as encryption at rest in its data centers; or its claim that the data “must be considered as pseudonymous” — but did not find sufficient safeguards had been put in place to effectively block US intelligence services from accessing the data, as required to meet the GDPR’s standard. “As long as the second respondent himself [i.e. Google] has the possibility to access data in plain text, the technical measures invoked cannot be considered effective in the sense of the above considerations,” it notes at one point, dismissing the type of encryption used as inadequate protection. Austria’s regulator also quotes earlier guidance from German DPAs to back up its dismissal of Google’s “pseudonymous” claim — noting that this states: ” …the use of IP addresses, cookie IDs, advertising IDs, unique user IDs or other identifiers to (re)identify users do not constitute appropriate safeguards to comply with data protection principles or to safeguard the rights of data subjects. This is because, unlike in cases where data is pseudonymised in order to disguise or delete the identifying data so that the data subjects can no longer be addressed, IDs or identifiers are used to make the individuals distinguishable and addressable. Consequently, there is no protective effect. They are therefore not pseudonymisations within the meaning of Recital 28, which reduce the risks for the data subjects and assist data controllers and processors in complying with their data protection obligations.” The DPA’s wholesale dismissal of any legally relevant impact of the bundle of aforementioned “Technical and Organizational Measures” (such as standard encryption) — which were cited by Google to try to fend off the complaint — is significant because such claims are the prevailing tactic used by US-based cloud giants to try to massage compliance and ensure EU-to-US data transfers continue so they can continue business as usual. So if this tactic is getting called out here, as a result of a single website’s use of Google Analytics, it can and will be sanctioned by EU regulators elsewhere. After all, Google Analytics is everywhere online. (See also the extensive list of extremely standard measures cited by Facebook in an internal assessment of its EU-to-US data transfers’ — in which it too tries to claim ‘compliance’ with EU law, per an earlier document reveal .) The complaint back story here is that back in August 2020 European privacy campaign group noyb filed a full 101 complaints with DPAs across the bloc targeting websites with regional operators that it had identified as sending data to the US via Google Analytics and/or Facebook Connect integrations. Use of such analytics tools may seem intensely normal but — legally speaking, in the EU — it’s anything but because EU-to-US transfers of personal data have been clouded in legal uncertainty for years. The underlying conflict boils down to a clash between European privacy rights and US surveillance law — as the latter affords foreigners zero rights over how their data is scooped up and snooped on, nor any route to legal redress for whatever happens to their information when it’s in the US, making it extremely difficult for exported EU data to get the necessary standard of “essentially equivalent” protection that it gets at home when it’s abroad. To radically simplify: EU law says European levels of protection must travel with data. While US law says ‘we’re taking your data; we’re not telling you what we’re doing; and you can’t do anything about it anyway, sucker!’. US cloud providers that are subject to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) are all in the frame — which takes in a broad sweep of tech giants, including Google and Facebook, since this law applies broadly to “electronic communications services”. While Executive Order 12,333 , a Reagan era mandate that’s also relevant as it also expanded intelligence agency powers to acquire data, is thought to target vulnerabilities in telecoms infrastructure. The EU-US legal clash between privacy and surveillance dates back almost a decade at this point. It was catalyized by the 2013 Snowden disclosures which revealed the extent of US government mass surveillance programs — and led, back in 2015, to the EU’s Court of Justice to invalidate the Safe Harbor arrangement between the bloc and the US on the grounds that EU data could no longer be considered safe when it went over the pond. And whereas Safe Harbor had stood for around 15 years, its hastily agreed replacement — the EU-US Privacy Shield — lasted just four. So the lifespan of commercially minded European Commission decisions seeking to grease transatlantic data flows in spite of the massive privacy risks has been shrinking radically. Some complaints about risky EU-to-US data transfers also date back almost a decade at this point. But there’s fresh enforcement energy in the air since a landmark ruling by the CJEU in July 2020 — which struck down the Commission’s reupped data transfer arrangement (Privacy Shield), which — since 2016 — had been relied upon by thousands of companies to rubberstamp their US transfers. The court did not outlaw personal data transfers to so-called third countries entirely. Which is why these data flows didn’t cease overnight smack bang in the middle of 2020. However it clarified that such data flows must be assessed on a case by case basis for risks. And it made it clear that DPAs could not just turn a blind eye to compliance — hi Ireland! — rather they must proactively step in and suspend transfers in cases where they believe data is flowing to a risky location like the US. In a much watched for follow-on interpretation of the court ruling, the European Data Protection Board’s (EDPB) guidance confirmed that personal data transfers out of the EU may still be possible — if a set of narrow circumstances and/or conditions apply. Such as the data can be genuinely anonymized so that it is truly no longer personal data. Or if you can apply a suite of supplementary measures (such as technical stuff like applying robust end-to-end encryption — meaning there’s zero access to decrypted data possible by a US entity) — in order to raise the level of legal protection. The problem for adtech firms like Google and Facebook is that their business models are all about accessing people’s data. So it’s not clear how such data-mining giants could apply supplementary measures that radically limit their own access to this core business data without a radical change of model. Or, well, federating their services — and localizing European data and processing in the EU. The Austrian DPA decision makes it clear that Google’s current package of measures, related to how it operates Google Analytics, is not adequate because it does not remove the risk of surveillance agencies accessing people’s data. The decision puts heavy underscoring on the need for any such supplementary measures to actually e nhance standard provisions if they’re to do anything at all for your chances of compliance. Europe puts out advice on fixing international data transfers that’s cold comfort for Facebook Supplementary of course means extra. tl;dr you can’t pass off totally standard security processes, procedures, policies, protocols and measures as some kind of special Schrems II-busting legal magic, no matter how much you might want to. (A quick comparable scenario that might hammer home the point: One can’t — legally speaking — hold a party during a pandemic if lockdown rules ban social gatherings simply by branding a ‘bring your own bottle’ garden soirée as a work event. Not even if you’re the prime minister of the UK. At least not if you want to remain in post for long, anyway… ) It’s fair to say that the the tech industry response to the Schrems II ruling has been a massive, collective putting of heads into sand. Or, as the eponymous Max Schrems himself, honorary chair of noyb, puts it in a statement : “Instead of adapting services to be GDPR compliant, US companies have tried to simply add some text to their privacy policies and ignore the Court of Justice. Many EU companies have followed the lead instead of switching to legal options.” This charade has been possible because — to date — there hasn’t been much regulatory renforcement following the July 2020 ruling. Despite the European Data Protection Board warning immediately that there would be no grace period for coming into compliance. To the untrained eye that might suggest the industry’s collective strategy — of ignoring the legal nightmare wrapping EU-to-US transfers in the hopes the problem would just go away — has been working. But, as the Austria decision indicates, regulatory gears are grinding towards a bunch of rude awakenings. The European Commission — which remains eager for a replacement to the EU-US Privacy Shield — has also warned there will be no quick fix this time around, suggesting major reforms of US surveillance law are required to bridge the legal divide. (Although negotiations between the Commission and the US on a replacement data transfer agreement are continuing.) In the meanwhile Schrems II enforcements are starting to flow — and orders to cease US data flows may soon follow. In another sign of enforcement ramping up, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) — just this week — upheld a complaint against the European Parliament over US data transfers involving use of Google Analytics and Stripe. The EDPS’ decision reprimands the parliament and also orders it to fix outstanding issues within one month. The other 101 complaints noyb filed back in 2020 are also still awaiting decisions. And as Schrems notes EU DPAs have been coordinating their response to the data transfer issue. So there’s likely to be a pipeline of enforcements striking at usage of US cloud services in the coming months. And, well, a lot of sand falling out of eyes. Here’s Schrems on the Austria DPA’s reasoning again: “This is a very detailed and sound decision. The bottom line is: Companies can’t use US cloud services in Europe anymore. It has now been 1.5 years since the Court of Justice confirmed this a second time, so it is more than time that the law is also enforced.” “We expect similar decisions to now drop gradually in most EU member states,” he adds, further noting that Member State authorities have been coordinating their response to the flotilla of complaints (the EDPB announced a taskforce on the issue last fall). “In the long run we either need proper protections in the US, or we will end up with separate products for the US and the EU,” Schrems also said, adding: “I would personally prefer better protections in the US, but this is up to the US legislator — not to anyone in Europe.” While netdoktor has been found to have violated the GDPR, it’s not clear whether it will face a penalty as yet. It may also seek to appeal the Austrian DPA’s decision. The company has since moved its HQ to Germany, which complicates the regulatory jurisdiction component of this process — and means it may face additional enforcement, such as an order banning transfers, in a follow on action by a German regulator. There is another notable element of the decision that has gone Google’s way — for now. While the regulator upheld the complaint against netdoktor it did not find against Google’s US business for receiving/processing the data — deciding that the rules on data transfers only apply to EU entities and not to the US recipients. That bit of the decision is a disappointment to noyb which is considering whether to appeal — with Schrems arguing: “It is crucial that the US providers cannot just shift the problem to EU customers.” noyb further flags that Google may still face some pending sanction, however, as the Austria DPA has said it will investigate further in relation to potential violations of Article 5, 28 and 29 GDPR (related to whether Google is allowed to provide personal data to the US government without an explicit order by the EU data exporter). The DPA has said it will issue a separate decision on that. So Google may yet be on the hook for a GDPR breach in Austria. Penalties under the regulation can scale as high as 4% of a company’s annual global turnover. Although orders to ban data transfers may ultimately prove a lot more costly to certain types of data-mining business models. To wit: Long time EU privacy watchers will be aware that Facebook’s European business is on penalty time in Ireland over this same EU-US transfers issue. A preliminary order that Facebook suspend transfers was issued by Ireland in fall 2020 — triggering legal action from the social media giant to try to block the order. Facebook’s court challenge failed but a final decision remains pending from the Irish regulator — which promised noyb a swift resolution of the vintage complaint a full year ago. So the clock really is ticking on that data transfer complaint. And someone should phone Meta’s chief spin doctor, Nick Clegg, to ask if he’s ready to pull the plug on Facebook’s European service yet?

The beta program will give users early access to new features and bug fixes, but like any other beta program, there is an increased risk when downloading an unstable build. Threads launched on Wednesday and has already attracted 70 million users in just two days. The platform is missing a few notable features, such as direct messages, a “Following” feed , a full web version, a chronological feed and more. Given that the platform currently has somewhat of a bare-bones structure, the new beta program could be tempting for users who want to get their hands on new features. The invitation for the beta program notes that “certain data on your use of the app will be collected and shared with the developer to help improve the app.” The invitation also warns that “testing versions may be unstable.” You can sign up for beta access today, as there’s no waitlist, which means that anyone with and Android device can enter the program and try out future builds. Threads allows Instagram users to authenticate with their existing credentials in order to post short updates, including text up to 500 characters, links, photos and videos up to five minutes in length. At launch, Threads is available on iOS and Android in 100 countries, though not in the EU, reportedly due to concerns around adhering to local data privacy regulations. Although Threads has only been available for two days, it has already caught the attention of Elon Musk-owned Twitter, as the social media company is threatening legal action against Threads and accusing Meta of poaching former Twitter employees to create the new platform.

On Thursday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the South Asian nation is joining the non-biding exploration program. “Today, we have taken a giant leap in our space cooperation by deciding to join Artemis Accords,” Modi said while addressing a joint press conference with President Joe Biden in the White House. The leader is currently on his official trip to the U.S. India has emerged as the next big market for space missions. It is a home to over a hundred startups developing launch vehicles , satellites and space situational awareness infrastructure . The spacefaring country has also attracted global investments and introduced regulatory changes to sketch out public-private collaboration. However, India took its time to join the Artemis Accords, which were kicked off in October 2020 with seven founding member nations, including the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada and Japan, possibly to give its own ecosystem some time to better align with the international agreement’s ambitions. The program currently has almost all the spacefaring countries, except China and Russia. Earlier this week, Ecuador became the 26th nation to join the Artemis Accords. The Artemis Accords, which reinforce and complement 1967’s Outer Space Treaty, are a set of principles and commitments to provide participating nations interoperability of systems, access to emergency assistance, use open standards and develop new ones for exploration and work toward creating a sustainable environment in space. Partnering nations need to release their space-related data publicly and protect sites and artifacts with historical value while conducting operations in space and on the moon. Further, the program ensures that member countries extract and utilize space resources for sustainable exploration. This means the nations participating in the initiative need to maintain efficiency while extracting and utilizing resources on the moon, Mars and asteroids. Participating countries are required to publicly disclose the location and nature of their operations to ensure safety and prevent conflicts with other members. The program also brings participants eye to eye for issues such as the mitigation of orbital debris and disposal of obsoleting spacecraft. Alongside signing the Artemis Accords, India’s national space agency Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has partnered with NASA to work on a joint mission to the International Space Station (ISS) in 2024. This endeavor aims to enhance the research capabilities of Indian astronauts by providing them with advanced training from NASA and granting them access to the ISS. Separately, India has committed to investing $318 million in the construction of a Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory within the country. This project will involve collaboration with counterparts in the U.S., Europe and Japan, with the objective of detecting ripples in space-time. By studying these phenomena, scientists hope to gain insights into the fundamental origins of the universe. Moreover, the U.S. Geological Survey’s Landsat Satellite Series and ISRO’s Resourcesat Series have agreed to expand bilateral data exchange. This collaboration aims to enhance the understanding of the Earth by leveraging data for various applications, including climate resiliency, sustainable development, natural resource management and support for disaster management. The announcements coincide with India’s key space advancements, including the lunar exploration mission Chandrayaan-3 and the human spaceflight launch Gaganyaan . The country is also exploring a regulatory move for satellite connectivity and is due to bring a clearer policy for foreign direct investments in the space sector.

https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/facebooks-lead-eu-privacy-supervisor-hit-with-corruption-complaint/,Facebook’s lead EU privacy supervisor hit with corruption complaint,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Facebook’s problems with European privacy law could be about to get a whole lot worse. But ahead of what may soon be a major (and long overdue) regulatory showdown over the legality of its surveillance-based business model, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) is facing a Facebook-shaped problem of its own: It’s now the subject of a criminal complaint alleging corruption and even bribery in the service of covering its own backside (we paraphrase) and shrinking the public understand of the regulatory problems facing Facebook’s business. European privacy campaign group noyb has filed the criminal complaint against the Irish DPC, which is Facebook’s lead regulator in the EU for data protection. noyb is making the complaint under Austrian law — reporting the Irish regulator to the Austrian Office for the Prosecution of Corruption (aka WKStA ) after the DPC sought to use what noyb terms “procedural blackmail” to try to gag it and prevent it from publishing documents related to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) complaints against Facebook. The not-for-profit alleges that the Irish regulator sought to pressure it to sign an “illegal” non-disclosure agreement (NDA) in relation to a public procedure — its complaint argues there is no legal basis for such a requirement — accusing the DPC of seeking to coerce it into silence, as Facebook would surely wish, by threatening not to comply with its regulatory duty to hear the complainant unless noyb signed the NDA. Which is quite the (alleged) quid pro quo. The letter sent by the DPC to noyb seeking an agreement to maintain the confidentiality of all material relating to objections by other DPAs (as well as any associated observations by the data controller (Facebook), complainant (noyb et al), DPC or other EU supervisory authorities) vis-a-vis a draft decision related a complaint against Facebook that’s undergoing an active dispute resolution procedure — “on the grounds that such arrangements are necessary to preserve/maintain free and frank exchanges” and to ensure that “interim views” are not aired in order to “preserve the confidentiality and integrity of the co-decision-making procedure” as the DPC’s letter circularly demands — has been published by noyb here (redacting the name/s of the DPC officer/s who put their name/s to the demand). “The DPC acknowledges that it has a legal duty to hear us but it now engaged in a form of ‘procedural coercion,’” said noyb chair, Max Schrems, in a statement. “The right to be heard was made conditional on us signing an agreement, to the benefit of the DPC and Facebook. It is nothing but an authority demanding to give up the freedom of speech in exchange for procedural rights.” The regulator has also demanded noyb remove documents it has previously made public — related to the DPC’s draft decision of a GDPR complaint against Facebook — again without clarifying what legal basis it has to make such a demand. Ireland’s draft GDPR decision against Facebook branded a joke As noyb points out, it is based in Austria, not Ireland — so is subject to Austrian law, not Irish law. But, regardless, even under Irish law it argues there’s no legal duty for parties to keep documents confidential — pointing out that Section 26 of the Irish Data Protection Act , which was cited by the DPC in this matter, only applies to DPC staff (“relevant person”), not to parties. “Generally we have very good and professional relationships with authorities. We have not taken this step lightly, but the conduct of the DPC has finally crossed all red lines. They basically deny us all our rights to a fair procedure unless we agree to shut up,” added Schrems. He went on to warn that “Austrian corruption laws are far-reaching” — and to further emphasize: “When an official requests the slightest benefit to conduct a legal duty, the corruption provisions may be triggered. Legally there is no difference between demanding an unlawful agreement or a bottle of wine.” All of which looks exceptionally awkward for the Irish regulator. Which already, let’s not forget — at the literal start of this year — agreed to “swiftly” finalize another fractious complaint made by Schrems, this one relating to Facebook’s EU-U.S. data transfers, and which dates all the way back to 2013, following noyb bringing a legal procedure. (But of course there’s still no sign of a DPC resolution of that Facebook complaint either … So, uhhh, “Siri: Show me regulatory capture” … ) Last month noyb published a draft decision by the DPC in relation to another (slightly less vintage) complaint against Facebook — which suggested the tech giant’s lead EU data regulator intended not to challenge Facebook’s attempt to use an opaque legal switch to bypass EU rules (by claiming that users are actually in a contract with it receive targeted ads, ergo GDPR consent requirements do not apply). The DPC had furthermore suggested a wrist-slap penalty of $36 million — for Facebook failing transparency requirements over the aforementioned “ad contract.” That decision remains to be finalized because — under the GDPR’s one-stop-shop mechanism for deciding cross-border complaints — other EU DPAs have a right to object to a lead supervisor’s preliminary decision and can ratchet out a different outcome. Which is what noyb is suggesting may be about to happen vis-a-vis this particular Facebook complaint saga. Winding back slightly, despite the EU’s GDPR being well over three years old (in technical application terms), the DPC has yet to make a single final finding against Facebook proper. So far it’s only managed one decision against Facebook-owned WhatsApp — which resulted in an inflated financial penalty for transparency failures by the messaging platform after other EU DPAs intervened to object to a (similarly) low-ball draft sanction Ireland had initially suggested. In the end WhatsApp was hit with a fine of $267 million — also for breaching GDPR transparency obligations. A notable increase on the DPC’s offer of a fine of up to $56 million. The tech giant is appealing that penalty — but has also said it will be tweaking its privacy policy in Europe in the meanwhile. So it’s a (hard won) win for European privacy advocates — for now. The WhatsApp GDPR complaint is just the tip, of course. The DPC has been sitting, hen-like, on a raft of data protection complaints against Facebook and other Facebook-owned platforms — including several filed by noyb on the very the day the regulation came into technical application all the way back in May 2018 . These “forced consent” complaints by noyb strike at the heart of the headlock Facebook applies to users by not offering them an opt-out from tracking-based advertising. Instead the “deal” Facebook (now known as Meta) offers is a take-it-or-leave-it “choice” — either accept ads or delete your account — despite the GDPR setting a robust standard for what can legally constitute consent that states it must be specific, informed and freely given Arm twisting is not allowed. Yet Facebook has been twisting European arms before and since the GDPR all the same. So the “forced consent” complaints — if they do ever actually get enforced — have the potential to purge the tech giant’s surveillance-based business model once and for all. As, perhaps, does the vintage EU-U.S. data transfers issue. (Certainly it would crank up Facebook’s operational costs if it had to federate its service so that Europeans’ data was stored and processed within the EU to fix the risk of U.S. government mass surveillance.) Facebook, Google face first GDPR complaints over ‘forced consent’ However, per the draft DPC decision on the forced consent issue, published (by noyb) last month, the Irish regulator appeared to be preparing to (at best) sidestep the crux question of the legality of Facebook’s data mining, writing in a summary: There is no obligation on Facebook to seek to rely solely on consent for the purposes of legitimising personal data processing where it is offering a contract to a user which some users might assess as one that primarily concerns the processing of personal data. Nor has Facebook purported to rely on consent under the GDPR. noyb has previously accused the DPC of holding secret meetings with Facebook around the time it came up with the claimed consent bypass and just as the GDPR was about come into application — implying the regulator was seeking to support Facebook in finding a workaround for EU law. The not-for-profit also warned last month that if Facebook’s relabelling “trick” (i.e., switching a claim of “consent” to a claim of “contract”) were to be accepted by EU regulators it would undermine the whole of the GDPR — making the much lauded data protection regime trivially easy for data-mining giants to bypass. Likewise, noyb argues, had it signed the DPC’s demanded NDA it would have “greatly benefited Facebook.” It would also have helped the DPC by keeping a lid on the awkward detail of lengthy and labyrinthine proceedings — at a time when the regulator is facing rising heat over its inaction against Big Tech, including from lawmakers on home soil . (Some of which are now pushing for reform of the Commission — including the suggestion that more commissioners should be recruited to remove sole decision-making power from the current incumbent, Helen Dixon.) “The DPC is continuously under fire by other DPAs, in public inquiries and the media. If an NDA would hinder noyb’s freedom of speech, the DPC’s reputational damage could be limited,” noyb suggests in a press release, before going on to note that had it been granted a benefit by signing an NDA (“in direct exchange for the DPC to conduct its legal duties”) its own staff could have potentially committed a crime under the Austrian Criminal Act. The not-for-profit instead opted to dial up publicity — and threaten a little disinfecting sunlight — by filing a criminal complaint with the Austrian Office for the Prosecution of Corruption. It’s essentially telling the DPC to put up a legal defence of its procedural gagging attempts — or, well, shut up. Here’s Schrems again: We very much hope that Facebook or the DPC will file legal proceedings against us, to finally clarify that freedom of speech prevails over the scare tactics of a multinational and its taxpayer-funded minion. Unfortunately we must expect that they know themselves that they have no legal basis to take any action, which is why they reverted to procedural blackmail in the first place. Nor is noyb alone in receiving correspondence from the DPC that’s seeking to apply swingeing confidentiality clauses to complainants. Following publication of noyb’s criminal complaint, Johnny Ryan, a fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, tweeted that it received a “confidentiality demand” from the DPC in relation to a GDPR complaint raised against Google’s adtech — suggesting the regulator is seeking to use the same threat of silence or be removed from the proceeding against another complainant against Big Tech. “Everything I and my lawyers read would be tracked in a ‘data room.’ Otherwise, DPC withholds all materials from us (including Google docs that are already public),” he wrote. DPC also sent us a confidentiality demand -in my complaint v mega Google RTB data breach. It is 6,429 words long. Everything I and my lawyers read would be tracked in a “data room”. Otherwise, DPC withholds all materials from us (including Google docs that are already public). — Johnny Ryan (@johnnyryan) November 23, 2021 TechCrunch has also reviewed correspondence sent to the Irish regulator earlier this fall by (yet) another complainant — who writes to query its legal basis for a request to gag disclosure of correspondence and draft reports. Despite repeated requests for clarification by the complainant, the DPC appears to have entirely failed — over the course of more than a month — to reply to the request for its legal basis for making such a gag request. This suggests noyb’s experience of threats and scare tactics lacking legal substance is not unique — by looks rather more like modus operandi — backing up its claim that the DPC has questions to answer about “how it conducts its office.” We’ve reached out to the DPC for comment on the allegations it’s facing. Update 1: The DPC has responded at length to what it says have been multiple media queries related to noyb’s action. In its remarks, which are written in a Q&A style — ostensibly responding to a number of specific questions it suggests were received from numerous media outlets (none of which were asked by this media outlet, however) — the regulator claims that information related to an ongoing procedure must be kept confidential in order to ensure “fairness to all parties”, which it further describes as a “Constitutional obligation”. It also writes that it “must balance its obligations to protect confidential information against the complainant’s and [emphasis its] the data controller’s rights to fair procedures.” But it does not specify the legal basis for this claimed ‘balancing obligation’. On the question of what legal basis the DPC is relying on to demand confidentiality, it writes vaguely that it “draws on its obligations under the GDPR, the Irish Data Protection Act 2018 and its Constitutional obligation to apply fair procedures”. Later it reiterates its claim that Section 26 of the Data Protection Act “ provides that the DPC may designate [emphasis its] information as being confidential so that it must be kept confidential while the inquiry is ongoing” for a number of reasons it already claimed in its letter to noyb — such as wanting to preserve a free and frank exchange; avoid parallel exchanges around an ongoing procedure; and avoid the publication of material that “may reasonably be considered likely to compromise the decision-making process and/or give rise to procedural unfairness and/or cause harm to the interests of the complainant and/or controller”. Section 26 of the Irish Data Protection Act does deal with prohibitions on the disclosure of confidential information — where clause (1) states: “A relevant person shall not disclose confidential information obtained by him or her while performing functions under this Act or the Data Protection Regulation unless he or she is required or permitted by law, or duly authorised by the Commission, to do so.” However — as Schrems/noyb already pointed out — the Act goes on to define “a relevant person” as either a Commissioner; a member of staff of the Commission; an authorized officer; any other person engaged under a contract for services by the Commission or a member of the staff of such a person; or a person who has acted in any of those capacities — none of which describes Schrems or noyb. So here the DPC appears to be attempting to misdirect the crux legal question — i.e. on what lawful grounds is the regulator demanding confidentiality around the procedure? — by not engaging with the substance of the legal critique. In short, it looks like copy-paste bluster. The DPC’s response includes further misdirection when it makes a reference to the Austria data protection authority — where the GDPR complaint in question was originally filed, before being referred to the Irish DPC under the regulation’s one-stop-shop mechanism for dealing with cross-border cases — writing that the Austrian DPA “held that Mr Schrems was not entitled to sight of documents exchanged between the DPC and its fellow data protection authorities”. But given this section of the procedure is being undertaken in Ireland by the Irish regulator, not in Austria by the Austrian regulator, it’s not clear what relevance Austrian procedural decisions vis-a-vis process openness have here. TechCrunch asked Schrems about this point — and he described it as “typical ‘reframing” by the DPC, accusing the regulator of “deliberately” mixing up two separate issues. Aka, whether a part of the procedure is open to the parties in general (as is the case in Ireland; but not in Austria); and “details about documents within a procedure”. “The Austrian DPA takes the view that the entire [GDPR] Article 60 cooperation procedure is not open to the parties at all (neither Facebook nor noyb), but only among DPAs. That’s arguable, even when I disagree personally,” Schrems explained. “The DPC takes the view it is open to the parties. “We urged them to coordinate, but they didn’t. Now we have one DPA that sees the procedure to be open (to Facebook in Ireland) and the other DPA to be closed (that’s ours in Austria). “IF it would be open to the parties, the Austrians would provide the documents (no doubt about it), they even made USB drives for us. So they [the DPC] deliberately mix up two things: If a part of the procedure is open to the parties in general — and — the details about documents within a procedure… ” NB: noyb has now responded in detail to the DPC’s claims — see update (1)b below for their full commentary. The DPC’s 1,339-word response (which we’ve pasted below in full for reference; see update (1 )a ) also does not directly address the question of the fairness of removing noyb from the procedure as its earlier letter threatens to unless it agrees to the confidentiality demand. Instead the regulator opts to pose the question of “what will happen to the case if Mr Schrems declines to give an undertaking — actionable in the Irish courts — that there will be no more publication of documents”; and whether “the objections phase and the final decision can proceed without him/noyb/the complainant receiving documents”. “The objections phase at least will proceed as planned,” the DPC writes on that, before equivocating an answer to what will happen after. “What happens at any later stage will depend on a number of factors to include the outcome of the consultation process as between the DPC and the other data protection authorities, but also on whether Mr Schrems’ maintains his present position that he must be given access to all materials on the basis that it will be for Mr Schrems alone to decide what (if anything) he may publish or use, and retaining the right to change his position at his sole election and at any time of his choosing.” The DPC concludes its screed by observing that: “Ultimately, noyb will also have a right of appeal against the final decision delivered at the end of the co-decision-making procedure” — which does not in any way compensate for an unfair procedure. But it does, perhaps, sound like a regulator that’s very comfortable with legal challenges — and may even be anticipating an additional layer of court action down the line, i.e. related to the DPC withholding documents from the complainant (when, presumably, it’s not withholding the same stuff from Facebook… Fairness eh!). TechCrunch’s view, after examining the DPC’s response, is there is nothing here to prevent a reasonable observer concluding that the bulk of the regulator’s ‘sweating toil’ is actually aimed at generating obfuscating friction (and even suggestive fictions) — which in turn is only likely to build in fresh delays that slow down regulatory procedures and, ultimately, further retard enforcement against tech giants like Facebook. But do take a good 15-20mins of your own time for a close reading of the DPC’s remarks (below) to make up your own mind. But what about Facebook? noyb’s press release goes on to predict a “tremendous commercial problem” looming for the data-mining giant — as it says DPC correspondence “shows that other European DPAs have submitted ‘relevant and reasoned objections’ and oppose the DPC’s view” [i.e., in the consent bypass complaint against Facebook]. “If the other DPAs have a majority and ultimately overturn the DPC’s draft decision, Facebook could face a legal disaster, as most commercial use of personal data in the EU since 2018 would be retroactively declared illegal,” noyb suggests, adding: “Given that the other DPAs passed Guidelines in 2019 that are very unfavourable to Facebook’s position, such a scenario is highly likely.” The not-for-profit has more awkward revelations for the DPC and Facebook in the pipe, too. It says it’s preparing fresh document releases in the coming weeks — related to correspondence from the DPC and/or Facebook — as a “protest” against attempts to gag it and to silence democratic debate about public procedures. “On each Sunday in advent, noyb will publish another document, together with a video explaining the documents and an analysis why the use of these documents is fully compliant with all applicable laws,” it notes, adding that what it’s billing as the “advent reading” will be published on noyb.eu — “so tune in!” So looks like the next batch of “Facebook Papers” that Meta would really rather you didn’t see will be dropping soon. via GIPHY Update (1)a: Here’s the DPC’s response to our request for comment in full (NB: We’ve redacted the name of the DPC officer which was appended to the end of the text): “Thank you for your recent media query to this office. The DPC has had numerous queries on the matter and so we have prepared a compilation of the answers in the hope that the information will be of assistance to you. 1. There seems to be a standoff between the original Austrian complainant and the DPC over confidentiality of documents. In the one-stop shop arrangements for GDPR, in a dispute like this, which jurisdiction has primacy: where the case was filed, or where it is being processed? Under the GDPR, because the relevant data controller (in this case, Facebook Ireland) has its main establishment in Ireland, the Irish DPC is what is called the “lead supervisory authority” and so has the obligation to investigate and make a preliminary decision about the issues raised in the complaint. The Austrian data protection supervisory authority referred the complaint to the Irish DPC on this basis. Once we have reached a “draft decision” (which is how our proposed decision is referred to under Article 60 of the GDPR), it is then sent to and considered by our colleagues in the data protection authorities in the other EU member states as part of a co-decision-making procedure. Following this process, the Irish DPC reaches a final decision on the complaint reflecting either the consensus achieved amongst data protection authorities or, where differences arise between them which cannot be reconciled, a decision of the European Data Protection Board following a dispute resolution procedure. The Irish DPC is obliged to follow Irish fair procedures law as part of our decision-making process. These fair procedures obligations have been confirmed on several occasions by the Irish courts, including the Supreme Court. One of the considerations here is that, as a matter of fairness to all parties, the integrity of the inquiry process should be respected and the confidentiality of information exchanged between the parties upheld. What we mean by this is that it would be unfair to any party under investigation by a regulator (not just the DPC) if the materials that they provide to that regulator, and the regulator’s queries to and correspondence with them, should be made public before any decision is reached in relation to the matters that are under investigation. This would effectively mean an investigation against anybody would be turned into an open, public process before any decision is reached against them, and this is not fair nor has it ever been a feature of regulation in Ireland up to now. Reflecting these sorts of considerations, Section 26 provides that the DPC may designate information as being confidential so that it must be kept confidential while the inquiry is ongoing. The reasons why information is designated as confidential include the following: – to preserve/maintain free and frank exchanges between the DPC and each of the complainant and the controller, facilitating the kind of dialogue (and associated information flows) necessary to ensure that all of the issues under examination can be fully and effectively explored, and positions advanced by relevant parties fully and properly tested; – to ensure that the issues under examination can be addressed within the confines of the decision-making process itself, and to reduce the scope for parallel exchanges taking place outside that process; and, – to avoid the publication (or other disclosure to third parties) of exchanges identifying interim views and/or positions that remain under consideration by the DPC and which, if disclosed prior to the conclusion of the decision-making process, may reasonably be considered likely to compromise the decision-making process and/or give rise to procedural unfairness and/or cause harm to the interests of the complainant and/or controller, as the case may be. It is of note here that both the Irish and Austrian data protection authorities agree that neither the complainant nor the controller have a right to participate in the consultation process that forms a key part of the co-decision-making procedure described above. From there, the Austrian DPA held that Mr Schrems was not entitled to sight of documents exchanged between the DPC and its fellow data protection authorities. For its part, the DPC believes that the parties should be given sight of such materials, provided only that they agree to treat them as confidential within the decision-making process 2. According to noyb/Schrems, the Austrian DPA says there is no confidentiality clause covering such procedural documents. You say in your letters to noyb that there is a confidentiality clause. As noted, the Austrian SA has made it clear on two separate occasions now that it did not consider that Mr Schrems was entitled to sight of documents exchanged between the DPC and its fellow data protection authorities in the course of the co-decision-making procedure. It has also expressed the view to the DPC that Mr Schrems would not have been entitled to the draft decision and accordingly its publication on foot of the equivalent Austrian process could not arise. The DPC’s position is as outlined under point 1. a. Does the DPC draw on legislation outside the 2018 data protection act regarding confidentiality of procedures? And, if so, where? The Irish DPC draws on its obligations under the GDPR, the Irish Data Protection Act 2018 and its Constitutional obligation to apply fair procedures (as set out above). b. NOYB says the paragraphs of the 2018 act the DPC cites apply only to a “relevant person” which includes DPC employees and contractors. Is this correct, or is there another section of the act that applies to parties in a complaint, too? One of the legal obligations on the Irish DPC is under Section 26 of the Data Protection Act 2018. This requires that “relevant persons” (which include officers of the DPC) must not disclose confidential information, unless this is required (for example, by fair procedures obligations, as explained above) or is permitted by law. Even then, however, the DPC must balance its obligations to protect confidential information against the complainant’s and the data controller’s rights to fair procedures. In practical terms, the DPC is bound to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the confidentiality of such material is upheld in its own hands but also when it passes to the hands of a third party. To put it another way, the DPC can’t comply with its obligation to protect the confidentiality of material in its own hands, if it then passes that same material to a third party, without restriction, knowing or reasonably believing there is a strong likelihood the third party will publish it 3. What happens to the case if Mr Schrems declines to give an undertaking – actionable in the Irish courts – that there will be no more publication of documents? Can the objections phase and the final decision proceed without him/NOYB/the complainant receiving documents As flagged above, neither the complainant nor the controller are afforded an active role in the co-decision-making procedure described briefly above, save to the extent that, for reasons derived from Irish procedural law, the DPC takes steps to afford the complainant and controller a right to see the objections and to make written observations if any adjustments are proposed to the current iteration of the draft decision. As such, the objections phase at least will proceed as planned. What happens at any later stage will depend on a number of factors to include the outcome of the consultation process as between the DPC and the other data protection authorities, but also on whether Mr Schrems’ maintains his present position that he must be given access to all materials on the basis that it will be for Mr Schrems alone to decide what (if anything) he may publish or use, and retaining the right to change his position at his sole election and at any time of his choosing. Ultimately, NOYB will also have a right of appeal against the final decision delivered at the end of the co-decision-making procedure.” Update (1)b: Noyb has now sent a detailed rebuttal of the DPC’s response — which we’re also publishing in full below. NB: Here the DPC’s source text is presented in quotation marks and formatted in italics; while noyb’s responses are presented below in bold to distinguish between them. Further note: noyb did not respond to the DPC’s response to question 3 — so we have excluded repeating that chunk of text: DPC: “1. There seems to be a standoff between the original Austrian complainant and the DPC over confidentiality of documents. In the one-stop shop arrangements for GDPR, in a dispute like this, which jurisdiction has primacy: where the case was filed, or where it is being processed?” Note by noyb: There is nothing in the answers below that answers the question in the headline about applicable procedural laws. DPC: “Under the GDPR, because the relevant data controller (in this case, Facebook Ireland) has its main establishment in Ireland, the Irish DPC is what is called the “lead supervisory authority” and so has the obligation to investigate and make a preliminary decision about the issues raised in the complaint.  The Austrian data protection supervisory authority referred the complaint to the Irish DPC on this basis.” Note from noyb: This is correct, but what is left out, is that the DPAs have to “coordinate” under Article 60(1) GDPR and that each DPA applies its own procedural law in such a case. So there is a “One Stop Shop” for the controller and the complainant, in their local language and under the local procedure. DPC: “Once we have reached a “draft decision” (which is how our proposed decision is referred to under Article 60 of the GDPR), it is then sent to and considered by our colleagues in the data protection authorities in the other EU member states as part of a co-decision-making procedure.  Following this process, the Irish DPC reaches a final decision on the complaint reflecting either the consensus achieved amongst data protection authorities or, where differences arise between them which cannot be reconciled, a decision of the European Data Protection Board following a dispute resolution procedure. The Irish DPC is obliged to follow Irish fair procedures law as part of our decision-making process.  These fair procedures obligations have been confirmed on several occasions by the Irish courts, including the Supreme Court.” Note from noyb: This is correct, but there is no mention about what “fair procedure obligations” exactly were confirmed by what court case. In fact there is not a single case that would provide for confidentiality before the DPC. We have asked for a legal basis in the law or in case law, but the DPC is silent on this. Just saying “some court said something about fair procedures” is not a basis to demand NDAs from parties or kick them out of the procedure (in fact it’s the opposite of a “fair procedure”). DPC: “One of the considerations here is that, as a matter of fairness to all parties, the integrity of the inquiry process should be respected and the confidentiality of information exchanged between the parties upheld.  What we mean by this is that it would be unfair to any party under investigation by a regulator (not just the DPC) if the materials that they provide to that regulator, and the regulator’s queries to and correspondence with them, should be made public before any decision is reached in relation to the matters that are under investigation.  This would effectively mean an investigation against anybody would be turned into an open, public process before any decision is reached against them, and this is not fair nor has it ever been a feature of regulation in Ireland up to now.” Note from noyb: This is Facebook’s position, but in fact public debate and criticism (especially when it comes to the data protection right of millions) in a democratic society cannot be limited to after a decision is made. In fact, it is crucial that parties and the public can form an opinion during a decision process. As a default political, regulatory or court procedures are therefore open to the public – unless there are serious grounds to limit information. The DPC take the view that by default the public and the parties may not voice concerns or just get informed about a procedure before it is too late. What comes in addition to that, is that the DPC is extremely complicated and slow in the decision process. The pending case lasts for about 3.5 years by now. Usually such decisions are shorter and the room for public debate is therefore more limited. In the “EU-US data transfer” case, the investigation is ongoing for more than 8 years. The public would never have been informed about the background of two CJEU decisions, if such “fairness” rules would have continuously applied since 2013. DPC: “Reflecting these sorts of considerations, Section 26 provides that the DPC may designate information as being confidential so that it must be kept confidential while the inquiry is ongoing. The reasons why information is designated as confidential include the following:” Note from noyb: This is incorrect. Section 26 does not have the word “designate” in it. It does not allow the DPC to (one-sidedly) just decide what is “confidential” or not. Instead there is an objective test to be applied, which may be contested by the parties, because the DPC’s view may go too far or not far enough. It is not an absolute right by the DPC to just “declare” things to be confidential. DPC: “-        to preserve/maintain free and frank exchanges between the DPC and each of the complainant and the controller, facilitating the kind of dialogue (and associated information flows) necessary to ensure that all of the issues under examination can be fully and effectively explored, and positions advanced by relevant parties fully and properly tested; –        to ensure that the issues under examination can be addressed within the confines of the decision-making process itself, and to reduce the scope for parallel exchanges taking place outside that process; and, –        to avoid the publication (or other disclosure to third parties) of exchanges identifying interim views and/or positions that remain under consideration by the DPC and which, if disclosed prior to the conclusion of the decision-making process, may reasonably be considered likely to compromise the decision-making process and/or give rise to procedural unfairness and/or cause harm to the interests of the complainant and/or controller, as the case may be.” Note from noyb: This is incorrect. Section 26 does not name any of these elements. They are completely made up by the DPC. DPC: “It is of note here that both the Irish and Austrian data protection authorities agree that neither the complainant nor the controller have a right to participate in the consultation process that forms a key part of the co-decision-making procedure described above. From there, the Austrian DPA held that Mr Schrems was not entitled to sight of documents exchanged between the DPC and its fellow data protection authorities.” Note from noyb: this is misleading – the Austrian DPA in fact only takes the view that the cooperation process under Article 60(3) to (5) GDRP is not open the (both) parties. The DPC instead explicitly says that both parties have a right to be heard in its letters. We urged both DPAs to come to consensus, but it seems they were unable to reach such a consensus. There is now a situation where the Irish DPA takes the view that there is a role for the parties, but that documents are secret and the Austrian DPA takes the view that there is no role for the parties, but if there would be a role, § 17 AVG make the documents useable for anyone. Bottom line is: Facebook will be heard and noyb will not. DPC: “For its part, the DPC believes that the parties should be given sight of such materials, provided only that they agree to treat them as confidential within the decision-making process” Note from noyb: There is no basis for such a conclusion. In fact, the DPC itself may violate Section 26 if it shares “confidential” documents with the parties, as Section 26 is absolute in the consequences. The reality is that Section 26 is binary: If it is “confidential” it has to stay within the DPC, if it is not “confidential” it may be shared with external parties, who are themselves not subject to Section 26. DPC: “2. According to noyb/Schrems, the Austrian DPA says there is no confidentiality clause covering such procedural documents. You say in your letters to noyb that there is a confidentiality clause. As noted, the Austrian SA has made it clear on two separate occasions now that it did not consider that Mr Schrems was entitled to sight of documents exchanged between the DPC and its fellow data protection authorities in the course of the co-decision-making procedure.” Note from noyb: This is incorrect and/or misleading. The Austrian DPA took the view that this entire process is not open to the parties (neither the complainant nor Facebook), so it does not fall under the right to access to documents (independent of the documents being confidential or not). The DPC take the opposite view, that the process is open to the parties, but the documents are confidential. The DPAs were unable to agree on a joint position. DPC: “It has also expressed the view to the DPC that Mr Schrems would not have been entitled to the draft decision and accordingly its publication on foot of the equivalent Austrian process could not arise.” Note from noyb: This is absolutely incorrect. The Austrian DPA never said that. They even provided us with a USB drive with all the documents of the procedure. § 17 AVG is binary: Once you get the documents, they are free. See for example the Austrian Supreme Administrative Court (VwGH 22. 10. 2013, 2012/10/0002; VwGH 21. 2. 2005, 2004/17/0173; Rz 5). DPC: “The DPC’s position is as outlined under point 1. a. Does the DPC draw on legislation outside the 2018 data protection act regarding confidentiality of procedures? And, if so, where? The Irish DPC draws on its obligations under the GDPR, the Irish Data Protection Act 2018 and its Constitutional obligation to apply fair procedures (as set out above).” Note from noyb: The GDPR has 99 Articles, the Irish Data Protection Act has hundreds of Sections and “Constitutional obligations” are not any clear framework for such a specific question. In fact the DPC cannot point to any specific provision, because there are none. DPC: “b. NOYB says the paragraphs of the 2018 act the DPC cites apply only to a “relevant person” which includes DPC employees and contractors. Is this correct, or is there another section of the act that applies to parties in a complaint, too? One of the legal obligations on the Irish DPC is under Section 26 of the Data Protection Act 2018.  This requires that “relevant persons” (which include officers of the DPC) must not disclose confidential information, unless this is required (for example, by fair procedures obligations, as explained above) or is permitted by law. Even then, however, the DPC must balance its obligations to protect confidential information against the complainant’s and the data controller’s rights to fair procedures.” Note from noyb: This is not in the law or any case law and just made up. DPC: “In practical terms, the DPC is bound to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the confidentiality of such material is upheld in its own hands but also when it passes to the hands of a third party.” DPC: “To put it another way, the DPC can’t comply with its obligation to protect the confidentiality of material in its own hands, if it then passes that same material to a third party, without restriction, knowing or reasonably believing there is a strong likelihood the third party will publish it” Note from noyb: This “conflict” is not really existing. The DPC has in fact blackened any documents that it considered “sensitive” or somehow protected. The rest is simply not falling under Section 26 and therefore there is no need to “balance”. The conflict that the DPC tries to generate here, is just because it declares even the most trivial email as “confidential”.” This report has been updated with a link to the DPC’s letter to noyb ; with Johnny Ryan’s confirmation of another confidentiality demand by the regulator in its complaint against Google’s adtech; with comment from the DPC and our analysis of its claims, including additional comment from Schrems; and with noyb’s detailed rebuttal of the DPC’s commentary Ireland’s data watchdog slammed for letting adtech carry on ‘biggest breach of all time’ Lack of big tech GDPR decisions looms large in EU watchdog’s annual report Topics Senior Reporter Natasha was a senior reporter for TechCrunch, from September 2012 to April 2025, based in Europe.

So until an AI can do it for you, here’s a handy roundup of the last week’s stories in the world of machine learning, along with notable research and experiments we didn’t cover on their own. This week, Google dominated the AI news cycle with a range of new products that launched at its annual I/O developer conference. They run the gamut from a code-generating AI meant to compete with GitHub’s Copilot to an AI music generator that turns text prompts into short songs . A fair number of these tools look to be legitimate labor savers — more than marketing fluff, that’s to say. I’m particularly intrigued by Project Tailwind , a note-taking app that leverages AI to organize, summarize and analyze files from a personal Google Docs folder. But they also expose the limitations and shortcomings of even the best AI technologies today. Take PaLM 2 , for example, Google’s newest large language model (LLM). PaLM 2 will power Google’s updated Bard chat tool, the company’s competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and function as the foundation model for most of Google’s new AI features. But while PaLM 2 can write code, emails and more, like comparable LLMs, it also responds to questions in toxic and biased ways. Google’s music generator, too, is fairly limited in what it can accomplish. As I wrote in my hands on , most of the songs I’ve created with MusicLM sound passable at best — and at worst like a four-year-old let loose on a DAW There’s been much written about how AI will replace jobs — potentially the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs, according to a report by Goldman Sachs. In a survey by Harris, 40% of workers familiar with OpenAI’s AI-powered chatbot tool, ChatGPT, are concerned that it’ll replace their jobs entirely. Google’s AI isn’t the end-all be-all. Indeed, the company’s arguably behind in the AI race. But it’s an undeniable fact that Google employs some of the top AI researchers in the world . And if this is the best they can manage, it’s a testament to the fact that AI is far from a solved problem. Google I/O 2023 is a wrap — here’s a list of everything announced Here are the other AI headlines of note from the past few days: Andrew Ng’s new company Landing AI is taking a more intuitive approach to creating computer vision training. Making a model understand what you want to identify in images is pretty painstaking, but their “visual prompting” technique lets you just make a few brush strokes and it figures out your intent from there. Anyone who has to build segmentation models is saying “my god, finally!” Probably a lot of grad students who currently spend hours masking organelles and household objects. Microsoft has applied diffusion models in a unique and interesting way , essentially using them to generate an action vector instead of an image, having trained it on lots of observed human actions. It’s still very early and diffusion isn’t the obvious solution for this, but as they’re stable and versatile, it’s interesting to see how they can be applied beyond purely visual tasks. Their paper is being presented at ICLR later this year. Meta is also pushing the edges of AI with ImageBind , which it claims is the first model that can process and integrate data from six different modalities: images and video, audio, 3D depth data, thermal info, and motion or positional data. This means that in its little machine learning embedding space, an image might be associated with a sound, a 3D shape, and various text descriptions, any one of which could be asked about or used to make a decision. It’s a step toward “general” AI in that it absorbs and associates data more like the brain — but it’s still basic and experimental, so don’t get too excited just yet. Everyone got excited about AlphaFold, and for good reason, but really structure is just one small part of the very complex science of proteomics. It’s how those proteins interact that is both important and difficult to predict — but this new PeSTo model from EPFL attempts to do just that. “It focuses on significant atoms and interactions within the protein structure,” said lead developer Lucien Krapp. “It means that this method effectively captures the complex interactions within protein structures to enable an accurate prediction of protein binding interfaces.” Even if it isn’t exact or 100% reliable, not having to start from scratch is super useful for researchers. The feds are going big on AI. The president even dropped in on a meeting with a bunch of top AI CEOs to say how important getting this right is. Maybe a bunch of corporations aren’t necessarily the right ones to ask, but they’ll at least have some ideas worth considering. But they already have lobbyists, right? I’m more excited about the new AI research centers popping up with federal funding . Basic research is hugely needed to counterbalance the product-focused work being done by the likes of OpenAI and Google — so when you have AI centers with mandates to investigate things like social science (at CMU) , or climate change and agriculture ( at U of Minnesota ), it feels like green fields (both figuratively and literally). Though I also want to give a little shout out to this Meta research on forestry measurement Lots of interesting conversations out there about AI. I thought this interview with UCLA (my alma mater, go Bruins) academics Jacob Foster and Danny Snelson was an interesting one. Here’s a great thought on LLMs to pretend you came up with this weekend when people are talking about AI: These systems reveal just how formally consistent most writing is. The more generic the formats that these predictive models simulate, the more successful they are. These developments push us to recognize the normative functions of our forms and potentially transform them. After the introduction of photography, which is very good at capturing a representational space, the painterly milieu developed Impressionism, a style that rejected accurate representation altogether to linger with the materiality of paint itself. Definitely using that! Topics AI Editor Writer & Photographer Devin Coldewey is a Seattle-based writer and photographer. His personal website is coldewey.cc.

Rivian may have actually done it, but getting there wasn’t easy. Just ask Rivian’s chief of software Wassym Bensaid . In a bid to drive down manufacturing costs and improve the performance of its EVs, Rivian changed 600 parts on its flagship R1S SUV and R1T pickup truck. The company left the exterior mostly untouched and instead reworked the guts, including the electrical architecture and a redesigned software user interface that provides detailed illustration-like graphics using Unreal Engine as well as deeper integration with Apple and Google. Bensaid, who joined the EV maker in 2019, drove the creation of the vertically integrated software stack at . In other words, Bensaid knows a thing or two about building a product from scratch in a high-stakes environment. Lucky for us, Bensaid will join us on the Builders Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 to discuss what it takes to build a product from scratch — including how to navigate conflict and challenges — and how Rivian is trying to bring joy to customers through software. We might even learn what’s coming next at the EV maker. Bensaid, who oversees the design of Rivian’s network architecture, security, data and analytics, battery management system and vehicle controls, has a long career in software and systems engineering. He started in wireless with NXP Semiconductors and Motorola and led the execution of research and development programs at Freescale and Intel. Most recently, Bensaid held senior engineering leadership positions at Intel and Silver Spring Networks, which was acquired by Itron. His results at Rivian have been well received. Even Volkswagen Group has taken notice. The German automaker recently agreed to invest $1 billion into Rivian as part of a broad software development deal that could expand to as much as $5 billion. Disrupt 2024 , which will be held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco from October 28 to October 30, is the center of the startup universe. Investors, founders, engineers, designers and anyone else who is connected or interested in tech converge at Disrupt to learn, network, share ideas and maybe even launch the next big product.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/17/varda-space-raising-new-tranche-of-funding-at-500m-post-money-valuation/,Varda Space raising new tranche of funding at $500M post-money valuation,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Varda Space Industries, the in-space manufacturing startup that wants to revolutionize the production of pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and more, is in the process of raising $25 million in new capital that would put its valuation at around $500 million after investment, according to documents viewed by TechCrunch. The fundraising comes at a crucial time for Varda, which is preparing to send its first spacecraft to orbit . The startup has ambitions to operate multiple autonomous “space factories” in orbit capable of manufacturing sensitive materials that can only be produced in a zero-G environment. While in-space manufacturing is not new, thanks to years of research on the International Space Station, no company has yet been able to manufacture in the space environment at scale nor return the products to Earth. The $25 million pre-Series C “family and friends” round is being raised as a special-purpose vehicle (or SPV) managed by Side Door Ventures, which has invested in two of Varda’s prior rounds. One of Side Door’s investors, Jordan Croom, joined Varda in September 2021 as head of payloads and mechanisms. According to his LinkedIn, Croom focuses primarily “on early stage deep/frontier tech in industries such as space, robotics, energy, climate, and transportation” at Side Door. The company may have since updated its term sheet. Hustle Fund Scale, which is helping organize the SPV, is requesting that interested investors commit and wire money by May 31. Varda declined to comment for this story. The company’s inaugural mission will fly on SpaceX’s Transporter-8 ride-share mission in June. The spacecraft, which was manufactured by Rocket Lab as part of a bulk-order buy, will contain small Varda-made manufacturing and reentry modules. After spending around three months in orbit, the company hopes to return between 40 and 60 kilograms of material to Earth. Among the applications that Varda is planning on targeting is pharmaceuticals. Microgravity has major implications for drug development and could improve bioavailability, extend shelf life, and offer other breakthroughs. The total addressable market for these products and others — including semiconductors and fiber-optic cables — could be astronomical. Last fall, Varda brought on a life sciences market development lead and a VP of biopharma business development to expand its relationships with potential pharmaceutical customers, according to LinkedIn. In March, the company also hired a principal pharmaceutical scientist. The El Segundo, California–based startup was co-founded by Will Bruey, an engineer who had a nearly six-year tenure at SpaceX working on its Dragon spacecraft, and Founders Fund principal Delian Asparouhov. The company has raised a notable amount of funding since being founded in the fall of 2020, including an $11 million seed round and a $42 million Series A . However, according to documents from HF Scale, Varda has raised $150 million to date from investors. Varda faces competition from companies such as Redwire, Space Forge and the Exploration Company that also have ambitions to manufacture sensitive materials in space.

https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/temasek-leads-550m-series-c-extension-into-orca-security-which-aims-for-further-international-foothold/,"Temasek leads $550M Series C extension into Orca Security, which aims for further international foothold",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Orca Security , an Israeli security company offering an agent-less platform for protecting cloud-based assets, secured a $550 million extension to the Series C funding round it raised seven months ago. The initial $210 million round brought the company’s valuation to over $1 billion, and the latest round boosts the valuation by 50% to $1.8 billion, Avi Shua, co-founder and CEO told TechCrunch. Temasek led the round and was joined by strategic investors SAIC and Splunk Ventures. The initial C round was led by CapitalG and included Redpoint Ventures, GGV, ICONIQ Capital, Lone Pine Capital, Stripes, Adams Street Partners, Willoughby Capital and Harmony Partners. Orca Security raises $210M Series C at a unicorn valuation The extension is in line with the quick rounds Orca Security racked up over the past year. The company raised a $55 million Series B round last December, which followed a $20.5 million Series A round prior to that in May. Since the Series C earlier this year, the company was busy building a new platform that will move the security environment to the cloud in minutes instead of months, Shua said. “It’s like an MRI for the cloud,” he added. “Once you connect to the cloud environment, you can get a comprehensive view of the risks without any friction.” As companies have moved to digital over the past two years, organizations were pushed to deliver features and capabilities in the digital space and couldn’t wait. This led to increased adoption of the cloud and security solutions. For Orca Security, this translated into “booming” growth, Shua said. The company has more than 200 people and grew revenue by 800%. After closing the Series C, Shua received interest from additional investors wanting to partner with the company, and some of the names stood out to him as partners that could help the company accelerate. “Temasek is a world-known investor and with strategic partners like Splunk and SAIC, we can go further,” he added. “We were not desperate for cash, but did want to position ourselves for the growth we were experiencing.” He intends to deploy the new funding into three areas: engineering to continue to deliver more functionality, to extend its global reach and on go-to-market. In support of both the global growth and go-to-market, Orca Security also announced Tuesday that it hired Meghan Marks as chief marketing officer. Previously, Marks was CMO for Palo Alto Network’s Prisma Cloud business unit. Orca Security is operating in over 15 countries today and recently launched versions of its website in German, French, Chinese and Japanese. It will expand its footprint in the U.K., where it is opening an office and R&D center in London, as well as across the EMEA and APAC regions. It plans to staff the new London office with two dozen employees by the end of the year. Shua sees the cloud continuing to move fast, and he expects cloud security to be the next trillion-dollar market over the next five years. “Orca Security is positioned to be a leader in the market, and we are focused on technology that no one else has,” he added. “We are living in a fragile world, and there are usually no negative aspects to cyber. If you fail, you just try again in the next few minutes, which makes it harder to control. This is the reason the cyber market is growing. What we deploy can be used to protect the environment.” Is there still room in the cloud-security market?

https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/05/confusion-sets-in-as-meta-content-moderators-go-without-pay/,Confusion sets in as Meta content moderators go without pay,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Content moderators under Sama, Meta’s content review sub-contractor in Africa, earlier today picketed at the company’s headquarters in Kenya demanding April salary, while urging it to observe the court orders that barred it from conducting mass layoffs. The demonstrations came after Sama, in an email, instructed moderators to clear with the company by May 11, a move the employees say is against the existing court orders. The 184 moderators sued Sama for allegedly laying them off unlawfully, after it wound down its content review arm in March, and Majorel, the social media giant’s new partner in Africa, for blacklisting on instruction by Meta. The court issued a temporary injunction on March 21 barring Sama from effecting any form of redundancy, and Meta from engaging Majorel , which was also instructed to refrain from blacklisting the moderators. Sama was directed to continue reviewing content on Meta’s platforms, and to be its sole provider in Africa pending determination of the case. However, Sama sent the moderators on compulsory leave in April saying it had no work for them as its contract with Meta had expired. Sama told TechCrunch that it had sent the notice “to staff whose contract had expired to go through our regular clearance process. This clearance process involves the return of company equipment to make sure that all final dues can be paid without deduction for that equipment, in accordance with Kenyan law.” It said the moderators’ contracts had ended in March after its deal with Meta expired, saying that it was only processing the moderators final dues. “We understand our former employees’ frustration because they were led by others to believe that they would all receive salary indefinitely while on leave, but that is not what the court dictated,” said Sama. Yet, Sama’s VP of global service delivery, Annpeace Alwala, had in an affidavit dated April 12, and seen by TechCrunch, asked the court to set aside the temporary injunction saying that keeping the content moderators came “with a serious cost implication.” Alwala had outlined that it would cost about $90,000 monthly to keep the moderators, and a further $135,000 to process their work permits and security bond. The moderators filed the suit alleging that Sama failed to issue redundancy notices, as required by Kenyan law. The suit also claims, among other issues, that the moderators were not issued with a 30-day termination notice, and that their terminal dues were pegged on their signing of non-disclosure documents. Sama says it observed the Kenyan law. Sama, whose long list of clientele includes OpenAI, dropped Meta’s contract and content review services , laying off 260 people in the process, to concentrate on labeling work (computer vision data annotation), following the heat from a 2022 lawsuit in Kenya by its former content moderator, Daniel Motaung . Motuang, a South African, had accused Sama and Meta of forced labor and human trafficking, unfair labor relations, union busting and failure to provide “adequate” mental health and psychosocial support. He was allegedly laid off for organizing a 2019 strike and trying to unionize Sama’s employees. Sama and Majorel moderators earlier this week voted to form a union.

Now, he’s out. Polestar said Tuesday Ingenlath has resigned as CEO , a position he has held since the EV startup spun out of Volvo in 2017. He will be replaced by Michael Lohscheller, who was previously CEO of the Stellantis brand Opel, as well as VinFast and Nikola. The executive shakeup comes at a precarious time for Polestar, which has undergone layoffs and other cost-cutting measures over the past year. The company, which is now publicly traded, is attempting to bring several new EVs to market even as it experiences slower sales growth. Earlier this year, Volvo divested a significant portion of its holdings. Polestar has since turned to banks for a $1 billion loan , critical funds needed to keep its EV plans moving ahead.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/28/satellite-to-phone-race-heats-up-with-voice-calls-and-cross-canada-access/,Satellite-to-phone race heats up with voice calls and cross-Canada access,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The prospect of contacting a satellite to send a text or contact emergency services may soon be an effortless reality as startups move from proof of concept to actual product. Canadians on the Rogers network, which just inked a deal with Lynk, will get direct satellite-phone connections across the country; and not to be outdone, AST SpaceMobile claims to have made the first satellite voice call using a regular cell phone as well. Connecting a stock smartphone like last year’s Samsung or iPhone to a satellite would have sounded like a fantasy a few years ago, when we all knew it was impossible. But now companies are jostling for position as it becomes clear that satellite services will be a compelling offering on any mobile plan or phone model over the next few years. Lynk’s approach is to offer as universal as possible an SMS service to as much of the planet as possible, in the hopes that no one who needs help or is off the grid for any other reason will ever have to face “no signal.” It has demonstrated texting from the middle of nowhere (in fact the founder texted me) and also can blanket an area unexpected without signal — due to a power outage or natural disaster — with crucial info like where to find shelter. The company has been striking deals across the world with various carriers, and is now at the very doorstep of the U.S. (which has a tough regulatory environment and entrenched mobile players) with a deal with Canada’s biggest provider, Rogers . Although the idea is that everyone will be able to use this, every satellite cellular station still needs to operate through a licensed carrier. The Rogers deal doesn’t necessarily mean total exclusivity (for example, you’re lost and need help but have a different carrier) but Lynk CEO Charles Miller told me it’s not always simple to figure out who does and doesn’t have access. “Every country is a little different,” he said. “Sometimes there’s technical limitations. They have national roaming in Canada, so perhaps it works out, our goal is to provide those services to everybody, but for now it’s TBD.” Here’s hoping the non-Rogers subscribers up there (and god knows they have their reasons) can get access if they need it. Bringing an alternative connectivity package to the table is AST SpaceMobile, which has launched its first test satellite and for the first time demonstrated a direct phone-to-satellite call using an unmodified consumer handset. I double checked (this stuff can be tricky) and this was a continuous two-way connection between the phone and the satellite, which relayed it to the terrestrial network: Abel’s phone in Texas was connected directly to the satellite for both send and receive two-way communications, without any other intermediary. He made the phone call by typing in the number to the regular Samsung dial app on the Galaxy S22, just like you would make any regular phone call. The other end of the phone call in Japan was received via the normal terrestrial communications network (a cell tower). Demonstrating the capability, even in 2G (as the company confirmed it was) is a big step forward, since the engineering involved in getting a regular phone to connect with something in low Earth orbit is already difficult — maintaining a continuous connection is even harder. Scaling is yet another problem that AST SpaceMobile will face, but having proven the capability, that challenge probably seems less daunting now. The company’s BW3 satellite is the prototype for a constellation that will provide “2G, 3G, 4G LTE and 5G” coverage from space, though they only have the first of those working just now. Let’s hope for great success, because I lose 5G just going down the block. Help me out, AST SpaceMobile. The other bands are “the next phase of testing,” the company said. Of course Apple has made headlines with its emergency SOS service, which connects to the Iridium network but requires you to sort of sight your phone on a passing satellite in order to exchange a set of mostly premade messages. Useful if you’re stuck in a canyon and need a helicopter to scoop you up , but not if you want to check the weather or tell your spouse your backpacking trip is going fine. Apple’s Emergency SOS via satellite prompts rescue after car goes off a cliff north of LA And then there’s T-Mobile and SpaceX, which plan to provide a Starlink data connection to the network’s customers . While no one can gainsay Starlink’s ability to provide a signal from orbit, it has not yet demonstrated an orbital connection to an unmodified phone, something it supposedly will do this year. Pretty soon these services will graduate from experiment to line item and we’ll be back to the days when texts cost a dime each. Still, it’s better than nothing, and that’s definitely what a lot of people have once they leave the city to take a hike or go fishing. Let’s hope the connection stays on-demand, though — no one needs to get spam messages from orbit while they’re waiting for the trout to bite in a remote mountain lake. That’s not a future anyone wants. Topics Writer & Photographer Devin Coldewey is a Seattle-based writer and photographer. His personal website is coldewey.cc.

https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/nso-pegasus-bahrain-iphone-security/,"A new NSO zero-click attack evades Apple’s iPhone security protections, says Citizen Lab",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A Bahraini human rights activist’s iPhone was silently hacked earlier this year by a powerful spyware sold to nation-states, defeating new security protections that Apple designed to withstand covert compromises, say researchers at Citizen Lab. The activist, who remains in Bahrain and asked not to be named, is a member of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, an award-winning nonprofit organization that promotes human rights in the Gulf state. The group continues to operate despite a ban imposed by the kingdom in 2004 following the arrest of its director for criticizing the country’s then-prime minister. Citizen Lab, the internet watchdog based at the University of Toronto, analyzed the activist’s iPhone 12 Pro and found evidence that it was hacked starting in February using a so-called “zero-click” attack, since it does not require any user interaction to infect a victim’s device. The zero-click attack took advantage of a previously unknown security vulnerability in Apple’s iMessage, which was exploited to push the Pegasus spyware, developed by Israeli firm NSO Group, to the activist’s phone. The hack is significant, not least because Citizen Lab researchers said it found evidence that the zero-click attack successfully exploited the latest iPhone software at the time, both iOS 14.4 and later iOS 14.6 , which Apple released in May. But the hacks also circumvent a new software security feature built into all versions of iOS 14, dubbed BlastDoor, which is supposed to prevent these kinds of device hacks by filtering malicious data sent over iMessage. Because of its ability to circumvent BlastDoor, the researchers called this latest exploit ForcedEntry. Citizen Lab’s Bill Marczak told TechCrunch that the researchers made Apple aware of the efforts to target and exploit up-to-date iPhones. When reached by TechCrunch, Apple would not explicitly say if it had found and fixed the vulnerability that NSO is exploiting. In a boilerplate statement re-released Tuesday, Apple’s head of security engineering and architecture Ivan Krstic said: “Apple unequivocally condemns cyberattacks against journalists, human rights activists, and others seeking to make the world a better place … Attacks like the ones described are highly sophisticated, cost millions of dollars to develop, often have a short shelf life, and are used to target specific individuals. While that means they are not a threat to the overwhelming majority of our users, we continue to work tirelessly to defend all our customers, and we are constantly adding new protections for their devices and data.” A spokesperson for Apple said BlastDoor was not the end of its efforts to secure iMessage and that it has strengthened its defenses in iOS 15, which is slated for release in the next month or so. Citizen Lab said the Bahraini government was likely behind the targeting of the Bahraini human rights activist, as well as eight other Bahraini activists between June 2020 and February 2021. Bahrain is one of several authoritarian states known to be government customers of Pegasus, including Saudi Arabia, Rwanda, the United Arab Emirates and Mexico; though, NSO has repeatedly declined to name or confirm its dozens of customers, citing nondisclosure agreements. Five of the targeted Bahrainis’ phone numbers were found on the Pegasus Project list of 50,000 phone numbers of potential surveillance targets of the Pegasus spyware, which gives its government customers near-complete access to a target’s device, including their personal data, photos, messages and location. One of those listed phone numbers belongs to another member of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, which Citizen Lab said was targeted months earlier and with a different zero-click exploit, called Kismet, which predates ForcedEntry. Citizen Lab says Kismet no longer works on iOS 14 and later since BlastDoor was introduced, but still poses a risk to devices running older iPhone versions. Two other Bahrainis, who now live in exile in London and consented to be named, also had their iPhones hacked. Moosa Abd-Ali, a photojournalist who was previously targeted by FinFisher spyware sold to the Bahraini government, had his iPhone hacked while living in London. Citizen Lab said it has only seen the Bahraini government spy in Bahrain and in neighboring Qatar, and said it suspects that another foreign government with access to Pegasus may have been responsible for the hack. Recent reporting found the United Arab Emirates, a close ally of Bahrain, is the “principal government” for selecting phone numbers in the U.K. Abd-Ali’s phone number was also on the list of 50,000 phone numbers. Bahraini activist Yusuf Al-Jamri also had his iPhone hacked, believed by the Bahraini government, some time before September 2019, though it is not known if Al-Jamri’s iPhone was hacked while in Bahrain or in London. Al-Jamri was granted asylum in the U.K. in 2017. The seven unnamed Bahrainis continue to work in the kingdom despite a long history of human rights violations, internet censorship and widespread oppression. Reporters Without Borders ranks Bahrain’s human rights record as one of the most restrictive in the world, ranked only behind Iran, China and North Korea. A 2020 report by the U.S. State Department on Bahrain’s human rights said the country cited considerable violations and abuses, and noted that the government “used computer programs to surveil political activists and members of the opposition inside and outside the country.” When reached, NSO Group did not answer specific questions nor would it say if the Bahraini government was a customer. In a statement attributed only as an NSO spokesperson sent via its external public relations firm Mercury, NSO said that it had not seen Citizen Lab’s findings and that it would investigate if it receives “reliable information related to misuse of the system.” NSO recently claimed it cut off five government customers’ access to Pegasus for human rights abuses. Zainab Al-Nasheet, a spokesperson for the Bahraini government, told TechCrunch in a statement: “These claims are based on unfounded allegations and misguided conclusions. The government of Bahrain is committed to safeguarding the individuals’ rights and freedoms.” Abd-Ali, who said he was arrested and tortured in Bahrain, said that he thought he would find safety in the U.K. but that he still encounters digital surveillance but also physical attacks, as many victims of spyware experience . “Instead of protecting me, the U.K. government has stayed silent while three of their close allies — Israel, Bahrain and the UAE — conspired to invade the privacy of myself and dozens of other activists,” he said.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/24/meta-verified-is-rolling-out-to-users-in-australia-and-new-zeland/,Meta Verified is rolling out to users in Australia and New Zealand,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Meta announced its subscription plan, Meta Verified, earlier this week and now the social media company is rolling out to users based in Australia and New Zealand. The company began the rollout around 6:30 PM Sydney time on Friday. The subscription offers a verified label, improved reach, better protection from impersonation, access to customer support and exclusive stickers on Facebook and Instagram. Users can look at the benefits offered by the subscription and the procedure to join on this website . The company is doing a slow rollout of the plan, so many users might not see the option to purchase it right away. Meta Verified is a paid plan for individual and professional accounts that costs $11.99 per month on the web and $14.99 per month on iOS or Android. Importantly, users need to buy separate plans for Instagram and Facebook, and currently, you can only purchase the web plan for Facebook. So if you wanted to buy Meta Verified for both platforms, you will need to spend $27 a month. In comparison, Netflix’s top-tier plan costs $19.99 per month and Spotify’s premium individual plan costs $9.99 per month. The company said that it hopes to “offer an account linking option in the near future.” That means the subscription could work across both services in the future. To purchase a Meta Verified plan, users need to be above 18, have a history of recent activity like posting and have a profile photo that matches the government ID they provide as proof. At the moment, Meta won’t allow subscribers to change their profile name, username, date of birth or profile picture without unsubscribing and applying again. What’s more, the company is also changing the meaning of the blue checkmark on the platform. While it’s not getting rid of checkmarks for notable profiles like Twitter, it’s changing the definition of it. Meta has changed the description of the checkmark from “a tool to help people find the real accounts of public figures and brands” to “a tool to help people find the real accounts of people and brands.” Earlier this week, the company told TechCrunch that to differentiate between notable profiles and Meta Verified subscribers, it will begin showing follower counts at more places. “The blue badge will look the same as we evolve the meaning of the badge to focus on authenticity,” it noted.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/11/scott-painter-autonomy-ads-vehicle-subscription-softwar/,Why Scott Painter is selling a beach house to start a new vehicle software company,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Serial entrepreneur Scott Painter’s plan to build an all-electric vehicle subscription company called Autonomy has not worked out. So he’s pivoting once again to what he calls the “hardest build” of his career. While Autonomy will continue operating the small 1,000-car fleet it assembled over the last few years — far from the stated goal of 23,000 — Painter is spinning out a new company called Autonomy Data Services, or ADS, he tells TechCrunch in an exclusive interview. That new company will provide a software platform and data to automakers who want to operate their own subscription services for electric, gas, new, or even used cars. Painter also says he’s in talks with car dealers, fleet operators, and even companies that sell construction and farm equipment but might want to offer subscriptions. He says an early version of the service is already generating revenue. Painter says ADS is negotiating with multiple automakers, including three that have already run their own subscription service in the past. The company is partnering with Deloitte to run the service; ADS will get a revenue share as the software-as-a-service provider, while Deloitte will charge the automakers (or other customers) to customize the platform. It’s yet another turnaround for Painter, who has had a rocky few years. After stepping down as CEO of auto retailer TrueCar in 2015 (a company he founded in 2005), he created car leasing startup Fair, which received over $300 million from SoftBank. That ended poorly , with early investors accusing SoftBank of driving the company into the ground and Painter ultimately stepping down as chairman in 2021. His latest pivot didn’t come easy, either. To make all this happen in the first place, Painter had to convince Autonomy’s investors, some of whom were underwater after the subscription service never took off as promised. “Our lenders had what’s called senior secured status; they could have killed the company and tried to liquidate the fleet” to get some of their money back, he says. But he worked with them to convert $32 million worth of debt in Autonomy into equity in ADS. He also says he had to “personally dig deep,” including selling a $6 million beach house on the Pacific Coast Highway, mortgaging another property, and “selling a bunch of assets that I didn’t want to sell.” “It has been the hardest build I’ve ever had as an entrepreneur,” he says, describing the whole process as “hugging the cactus.” Autonomy was already struggling last year when Elon Musk’s aggressive price-cutting destroyed the value of the small fleet , which was mostly Teslas. (Painter, who knows Musk personally, says he has tried “to impress upon Elon how important it is to be more predictable about discounting” to no avail.) The problem this time around is that most every major automaker has already tried subscription services. And almost every single one of them walked away from the idea. Painter says that happened because automakers “did not have the fidelity yet, or the understanding of how subscriptions would work.” Because all of those automaker subscription services were brand new, he says, they didn’t understand how customers would behave. Would they subscribe for just a few months? Or a few years? Without that information, Painter argues, it’s really hard to figure out pricing, and so automakers charged a lot for their subscription services – something that scared away buyers. That kind of information is one of the things he plans to offer with ADS. And it’s not just coming from the Autonomy customers. Painter quietly bought up the assets of bankrupt used car marketplace Shift Technologies earlier this year for less than a million dollars. In the years leading up to its collapse, Shift had bought Painter’s former car-leasing startup Fair, which itself had previously acquired Ford’s subscription service Canvas — bringing the remnants of his former business back under his ownership — and Uber’s leasing service Xchange. The data from all of those companies can be used to predict “how long people stay in cars based on their customer cohort, what their FICO score is, how much income they have, so on and so forth,” Painter says. This is important not just because it offers certainty, but because the flexibility of subscription services is attractive to customers with lower credit scores. In addition to the customer data, Painter says he got all the source code, patents, trademarks and compliance and legal “work product” from those defunct businesses, which he says should make it very easy for ADS to get up and running with customers in new markets. In all, he says he got more than a terabyte, jokingly calling it an “astonishing avalanche of s—.” “My IT guys were just like, what are you going to do with all this stuff? It just kept coming,” he says. But, he points out, the companies that generated all this data “spent almost a billion dollars collectively developing software” that he now owns and is using at ADS. “I mean, when [SoftBank CEO] Masayoshi Son finds out that I was able to buy all of the Fair IP and assets for less than a million dollars, it’s just, I mean, it’s gonna just kill him,” he jokes. And while he’s gathered $2.5 million to fund the effort, the work is not done. “We’ve done everything that we had to do to make [ADS] an investable business. Right now we’re just looking for an equity partner that will come in for somewhere between $5 [million] and $8 million,” he says. “That’ll give the company two years of runway to then continue to scale with Deloitte.” Topics Sr. Reporter, Transportation LIMITED TIME: Save $300+ on your ticket, plus an additional 50% on a second for a full immersive day of AI!

https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/24/rocket-lab-reveals-big-supplier-deal-with-mystery-mega-constellation-customer/,Rocket Lab reveals big supplier deal with mystery mega constellation customer,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Rocket Lab has proven that it’s much more than a launch company. One glance at the company’s most recent earnings presentation shows as much: its space systems business, which designs, manufactures and sells satellite components and spacecraft, brought in over 70% of company revenue compared to launch in 2022, at $150.3 million versus $60.7 million, respectively. The space systems business — whose products include star trackers, reaction wheels, solar power systems, separation systems and more — also saw a massive growth in revenue, increasing by 239% year-over-year. To meet this growing demand, the company further announced last year that it was building out new manufacturing capabilities for reaction wheels, in particular. The investment is paying off: It appears that Rocket Lab has landed a contract to provide reaction wheels to an unnamed mega constellation customer. The company said as much in a February press release announcing a new 12Nms reaction wheel product, saying that the wheel is “currently planned for flight with an undisclosed large mega constellation customer.” More recently, Rocket Lab CFO Adam Spice added more color to this statement, revealing that the deal is worth “thousands” of reaction wheels per year. “We entered into an agreement with a mega constellation where it’s thousands of reaction wheels per year and much bigger reaction wheels,” Spice said at Cowen’s 44th Annual Aerospace/Defense and Industrials Conference in February. “What that allowed us to do is build a dedicated high-volume production facility in New Zealand and we brought the cost down by almost an order of magnitude on those wheels.” At a Bank of America event this Tuesday, Spice reiterated the enormity of the deal: “We secured a contract with a mega constellation customer where we’ll ship two or three thousand reaction wheels per year to one customer.” While the company has not publicly disclosed the name of this customer — and declined to comment on the matter to TechCrunch, citing commercial sensitivity — there’s only a handful of known possibilities. Amazon’s Project Kuiper is one likely candidate, and OneWeb’s growing network could plausibly be another. SpaceX has demonstrated that it wants to stay in-house as much as possible for its production stack, however, so Starlink isn’t likely. In its data sheet on the 12Nms reaction wheel, Rocket Lab lists the base price at $100,000. Of course, on contracts of this size, the price per unit is often discounted (which Spice acknowledged, saying at the Cowen conference that the ASP for the mega constellation reaction wheels “came down quite a bit”), but it suggests a big win for Rocket Lab’s revenues and a possible source for the doubling of the company’s backlog last year: from $241 million at the end of 2021 to $503 million.

https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/nym-gets-6m-for-its-anonymous-overlay-mixnet-to-sell-privacy-as-a-service/,Nym gets $6M for its anonymous overlay mixnet to sell privacy as a service,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Switzerland-based privacy startup Nym Technologies has raised $6 million, which is being loosely pegged as a Series A round. Earlier raises included a $2.5 million seed round in 2019. The founders also took in grant money from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research fund during an earlier R&D phase developing the network tech. The latest funding will be used to continue commercial development of network infrastructure, which combines an old idea for obfuscating the metadata of data packets at the transport network layer ( Mixnets ) with a crypto inspired reputation and incentive mechanism to drive the required quality of service and support a resilient, decentralized infrastructure. Nym’s pitch is it’s building “an open-ended anonymous overlay network that works to irreversibly disguise patterns in Internet traffic”. Unsurprisingly, given its attention to crypto mechanics, investors in the Series A have strong crypto ties — and cryptocurrency-related use cases are also where Nym expects its first users to come from — with the round led by Polychain Capital, with participation from a number of smaller European investors including Eden Block, Greenfield One, Maven11, Tioga and 1kx. The internet’s “original sin” was that core infrastructure wasn’t designed with privacy in mind. Therefore the level of complexity involved in Mixnets — shuffling and delaying encrypted data packets in order to shield sender-to-recipient metadata from adversaries with a global view of a network — probably seemed like over-engineering all the way back when the web’s scaffolding was being pieced together. But then came Bitcoin and the crypto boom and — also in 2013 — the Snowden revelations, which ripped the veil off the NSA’s “collect it all” mantra, as Booz Allen Hamilton sub-contractor Ed risked it all to dump data on his own (and other) governments’ mass surveillance programs. Suddenly network level adversaries were front page news. And so was internet privacy. Since Snowden’s big reveal, there’s been a slow burn of momentum for privacy tech — with rising consumer awareness fuelling usage of services like E2E encrypted email and messaging apps. Sometimes in spurts and spikes, related to specific data breaches and scandals. Or indeed privacy-hostile policy changes by mainstream tech giants ( hi Facebook !). Signal’s Brian Acton talks about exploding growth, monetization and WhatsApp data-sharing outrage Legal clashes between surveillance laws and data protection rights are also causing growing B2B headaches, especially for U.S.-based cloud services. While growth in cryptocurrencies is driving demand for secure infrastructure to support crypto trading. In short, the opportunity for privacy tech, both B2B and consumer-facing, is growing. And the team behind Nym thinks conditions look ripe for general purpose privacy-focused networking tech to take off too. Of course there is already a well-known anonymous overlay network in existence: Tor, which does onion routing to obfuscate where traffic was sent from and where it ends up. The node-hopping component of Nym’s network shares a feature with the Tor network. But Tor does not do packet mixing — and Nym’s contention is that a functional mixnet can provide even stronger network-level privacy. It sets out the case on its website — arguing that “Tor’s anonymity properties can be defeated by an entity that is capable of monitoring the entire network’s ‘entry’ and ‘exit’ nodes” since it does not take the extra step of adding “timing obfuscation” or “decoy traffic” to obfuscate the patterns that could be exploited to deanonymize users. “Although these kinds of attacks were thought to be unrealistic when Tor was invented, in the era of powerful government agencies and private companies, these kinds of attacks are a real threat,” Nym suggests, further noting another difference in that Tor’s design is “based on a centralized directory authority for routing”, whereas Nym fully decentralizes its infrastructure. Proving that suggestion will be quite the challenge, of course. And Nym’s CEO is upfront in his admiration for Tor — saying it is the best technology for securing web browsing right now. “Most VPNs and almost all cryptocurrency projects are not as secure or as private as Tor — Tor is the best we have right now for web browsing,” says Nym founder and CEO Harry Halpin. “ We do think Tor made all the right decisions when they built the software — at the time there was no interest from venture capital in privacy, there was only interest from the U.S. government. And the internet was too slow to do a mixnet. And what’s happened is, speed up 20 years, things have transformed. Who’s funding privacy tech? “The U.S. government is no longer viewed as a defender of privacy. And now — weirdly enough — all of a sudden venture capital is interested in privacy and that’s a really big change”, said Halpin. With such a high level of complexity involved in what Nym’s doing, it will, very evidently, need to demonstrate the robustness of its network protocol and design against attacks and vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis — such as those seeking to spot patterns or identify dummy traffic and be able to relink packets to senders and receivers. The tech is open source, but Nym confirms the plan is to use some of the Series A funding for an independent audit of new code. It also touts the number of PhDs it has hired to-date — and plans to hire a bunch more, saying it will be using the new round to more than double its headcount, including hiring cryptographers and developers, as well as marketing specialists in privacy. The main motivation for the raise, per Halpin, is to spend on more R&D to explore — and (he hopes) — solve some of the more specific use cases it’s kicking around, beyond the basic one of letting developers use the network to shield user traffic (à la Tor). Nym’s white paper, for example, touts the possibility for the tech being used to enable users to prove they have the right to access a service without having to disclose their actual identity to the service provider. Another big difference versus Tor is that Tor is a not-for-profit — whereas Nym wants to build a for-profit business around its mixnet. It intends to charge users for access to the network — so for the obfuscation as a service of having their data packets mixed into a crowd of shuffled, encrypted and proxy node-hopped others. But potentially also for some more bespoke services — with Nym’s team eyeing specific use cases such as whether its network could offer itself as a “super VPN” to the banking sector to shield their transactions; or provide a secure conduit for AI companies to carry out machine learning processing on sensitive data-sets (such as healthcare data) without risking exposing the information itself. “The main reason we raised this Series A is we need to do more R&D to solve some of these use cases,” says Halpin. “But what impressed Polychain was they said ‘wow there’s all these people that are actually interested in privacy — that want to run these nodes, that actually want to use the software.’ So originally when we envisaged this startup we were imagining more B2B use cases, I guess, and what I think Polychain was impressed with was there seemed to be demand from B2C; consumer demand that was much higher than expected.” Halpin says they expect the first use cases and early users to come from the crypto space — where privacy concerns routinely attach themselves to blockchain transactions. The plan is to launch the software by the end of the year or early next, he adds. “We will have at least some sort of chat applications — for example it’s very easy to use our software with Signal… so we do think something like Signal is an ideal use case for our software — and we would like to launch with both a [crypto] wallet and a chat app,” he says. “Then over the next year or two — because we have this runway — we can work more on kind of higher speed applications. Things like try to find partnerships with browsers, with VPNs.” At this (still fairly early) stage of the network’s development — an initial testnet was launched in 2019 — Nym’s eponymous network has amassed more than 9,000 nodes. These distributed, crowdsourced providers are only earning a NYM reputation token for now, and it remains to be seen how much exchangeable crypto value they might earn in the future as suppliers of key infrastructure if/when usage takes off. Why didn’t mixnets as a technology take off before, though? After all, the idea dates back to the 1980s. There’s a range of reasons, according to Halpin — issues with scalability being one of them one. And a key design “innovation” he points to vis-à-vis its implementation of mixnet technology is the ability to keep adding nodes so the network is able to scale to meet demand. Another key addition is that the Nym protocol injects dummy traffic packets into the shuffle to make it harder for adversaries to decode the path of any particular message — aiming to bolster the packet mixing process against vulnerabilities like correlation attacks. While the Nym network’s crypto-style reputation and incentive mechanism — which works to ensure the quality of mixing (“ via a novel proof of mixing scheme”, as its white paper puts it ) — is another differentiating component Halpin flags. “One of our core innovations is we scale by adding servers. And the question is how do we add servers? To be honest we added servers by looking at what everyone had learned about reputation and incentives from cryptocurrency systems,” he tells TechCrunch. “We copied that — those insights — and attached them to mix networks. So the combination of the two things ends up being pretty powerful. “The technology does essentially three things… We mix packets. You want to think about an unencrypted packet like a card, an encrypted packet you flip over so you don’t know what the card says, you collect a bunch of cards and you shuffle them. That’s all that mixing is — it just randomly permutates the packets… Then you hand them to the next person, they shuffle them. You hand them to the third person, they shuffle them. And then they had the cards to whoever is at the end. And as long as different people gave you cards at the beginning you can’t distinguish those people.” More generally, Nym also argues it’s an advantage to be developing mixnet technology that’s independent and general purpose — folding all sorts and types of traffic into a shuffled pack — suggesting it can achieve greater privacy for users’ packets in this pooled crowd versus similar tech offered by a single provider to only their own users (such as the “privacy relay” network recently announced by Apple ). Apple unveils new iOS 15 privacy features at WWDC In the latter case, an attacker already knows that the relayed traffic is being sent by Apple users who are accessing iCloud services. Whereas — as a general purpose overlay layer — Nym can, in theory, provide contextual coverage to users as part of its privacy mix. So another key point is that the level of privacy available to Nym users scales as usage does. Historical performance issues with bandwidth and latency are other reasons Halpin cites for mixnets being largely left on the academic shelf. (There have been some other deployments, such as Loopix — which Nym’s white paper says its design builds on by extending it into a “general purpose incentivized mixnet architecture” — but it’s fair to say the technology hasn’t exactly gone mainstream.) Nonetheless, Nym’s contention is the tech’s time is finally coming; firstly because technical challenges associated with mixnets can be overcome — because of gains in internet bandwidth and compute power; as well as through incorporating crypto-style incentives and other design tweaks it’s introducing (e.g. dummy traffic) — but also, and perhaps most importantly, because privacy concerns aren’t simply going to disappear. Indeed, Halpin suggests governments in certain countries may ultimately decide their exposure to certain mainstream tech providers which are subject to state mass surveillance regimes — whether that’s the US version or China’s flavor or elsewhere — simply isn’t tenable over the longer run and that trusting sensitive data to corporate VPNs based in countries subject to intelligence agency snooping is a fool’s game. (And it’s interesting to note, for example, that the European Data Protection Supervisor is currently conducting a review of EU bodies use of mainstream U.S. cloud services from AWS and Microsoft to check whether they are in compliance with last summer’s Schrems II ruling by the CJEU, which struck down the EU-US Privacy Shield deal , after again finding U.S. surveillance law to be essentially incompatible with EU privacy rights… ) Nym is betting that some governments will — eventually — come looking for alternative technology solutions to the spying problem. Although government procurement cycles make that play a longer game. In the near term, Halpin says they expect interest and usage for the metadata-obscuring tech to come from the crypto world, where there’s a need to shield transactions from view of potential hackers. “The websites that [crypto] people use — these exchanges — have also expressed interest,” he notes, flagging that Nym also took in some funding from Binance Labs, the VC arm of the cryptocurrency exchange, after it was chosen to go through the Lab’s incubator program in 2018. EU bodies’ use of US cloud services from AWS, Microsoft being probed by bloc’s privacy chief The issue for crypto users is their networks are (relatively) small, per Halpin — which makes them vulnerable to deanonymization attacks. “The thing with a small network is it’s easy for random people to observe this. For example, people who want to hack your exchange wallet — which happens all the time. So what cryptocurrency exchanges and companies that deal with cryptocurrency are concerned about is typically they do not want the IP address of their wallet revealed for certain kinds of transactions,” he adds. “This is a real problem for cryptocurrency exchanges — and it’s not that their enemy is the NSA; their enemy could be — and almost always is — an unknown, often lone individual but highly skilled hacker. And these kinds of people can do network observations, on smaller networks like cryptocurrency networks, that are essentially are as powerful as what the NSA could do to the entire internet.” There are now a range of startups seeking to decentralize various aspects of internet or common computing infrastructure — from file storage to decentralized DNS. And while some of these tout increased security and privacy as core benefits of decentralization — suggesting they can “fix” the problem of mass surveillance by having an architecture that massively distributes data, Halpin argues that a privacy claim being routinely attached to decentralized infrastructure is misplaced. (He points to a paper he co-authored on this topic, entitled “Systematizing Decentralization and Privacy: Lessons from 15 Years of Research and Deployments”.) “Almost all of those projects gain decentralization at the cost of privacy,” he argues. “Because any decentralized system is easier to observe because the crowd has been spread out… than a centralized system — to a large extent. If the adversary is sufficiently powerful enough to observe all the participants in the system. And historically we believe that most people who are interested in decentralization are not experts in privacy and underestimate how easy it is to observe decentralized systems — because most of these systems are actually pretty small.” He points out there are “only” 10,000 full nodes in Bitcoin, for example, and a similar amount in Ethereum — while other, newer and more nascent decentralized services are likely to have fewer nodes, maybe even just a few hundred or thousand. And while the Nym network has a similar amount of nodes to Bitcoin, the difference is it’s a mixnet too — so it’s not just decentralized but it’s also using multiple layers of encryption and traffic mixing and the various other obfuscation steps which he says “none of these other people do”. “We assume the enemy is observing everything in our software,” he adds. “We are not what we call ‘security through obscurity’ — security through obscurity means you assume the enemy just can’t see everything; isn’t looking at your software too carefully; doesn’t know where all your servers are. But — realistically — in an age of mass surveillance, the enemy will know where all your services are and they can observe all the packets coming in, all the packets coming out. And that’s a real problem for decentralized networks.” Post-Snowden, there’s certainly been growing interest in privacy by design — and a handful of startups and companies have been able to build momentum for services that promise to shield users’ data, such as DuckDuckGo (nontracking search); Protonmail (E2E encrypted email); and Brave (privacy-safe browsing). Apple has also, of course, very successfully markets its premium hardware under a “privacy respecting” banner. Halpin says he wants Nym to be part of that movement; building privacy tech that can touch the mainstream. “Because there’s so much venture capital floating into the market right now I think we have a once in a generation chance — just as everyone was excited about P2P in 2000 — we have a once in a generation chance to build privacy technology and we should build companies which natively support privacy, rather than just trying to bolt it on, in a half hearted manner, onto non-privacy respecting business models. “Now I think the real question — which is why we didn’t raise more money — is, is there enough consumer and business demand that we can actually discover what the cost of privacy actually is? How much are people willing to pay for it and how much does it cost? And what we do is we do privacy on such a fundamental level is we say what is the cost of a privacy-enhanced byte or packet? So that’s what we’re trying to figure out: How much would people pay just for a privacy-enhanced byte and how much does just a privacy enhanced byte cost? And is this a small enough marginal cost that it can be added to all sorts of systems — just as we added TLS to all sorts of systems and encryption.” Topics Senior Reporter Natasha was a senior reporter for TechCrunch, from September 2012 to April 2025, based in Europe.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/23/the-waymo-zeekr-robotaxi-has-come-to-san-francisco/,The Waymo-Zeekr robotaxi has come to San Francisco,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Waymo has started testing on public roads in San Francisco a new robotaxi built by Chinese electric automaker Zeekr. Waymo has “less than a handful” of the Zeekr vehicles in San Francisco today and isn’t driving them autonomously yet. Still, the fact that Waymo has hit the roads with a roomier, custom-built robotaxi signals the next phase of the Alphabet-owned company’s autonomous vehicle technology journey. The public testing milestone has been several years in the making. Waymo first announced plans to build an electric autonomous ride-hail vehicle with Zeekr for the U.S. market in December 2021. Waymo uses Jaguar I-Paces , retrofitted with its fifth-generation Driver, for its commercial robotaxi operations. And for those who have ridden in one with a group, it can be a tight squeeze. The new minivan-esque vehicle, which appears to be modeled after Zeekr’s upcoming Zeekr 009 minivan, is outfitted with Waymo’s sixth-generation hardware — a more cost-effective set of sensors than previous versions that is also designed to operate in winter environments. “Our fourth generation, which was just on the [Chrysler] Pacificas, were vital to helping us prove that we can operate fully autonomously or go rider-only,” Waymo spokesperson Sandy Karp told TechCrunch. “The fifth-generation hardware was critical to help us scale to four cities as of now, as well as navigate dense urban environments. The sixth-generation hardware builds on those capabilities, but it has a much more simplified design. It brings down the cost significantly, and it will help us operate autonomously in colder cities.” It’s not clear when Waymo will launch in cities that experience wintry weather conditions. Last winter, Waymo tested its robotaxis in Buffalo, New York and has since left the city. Karp said Waymo continues to test its Driver on winter roads in simulation during the summer months, and will test again in another cold climate later this year. Karp noted that while Waymo is laser-focused on scaling its Waymo One ride-hailing service in the cities where it currently operates — Phoenix , San Francisco Los Angeles and Austin — the sixth-generation Driver is what will help it expand. But first, the sixth-gen hardware needs to be rigorously tested. Waymo isn’t only testing its upgraded sensor suite — which includes in-house designed and built lidar, radar, cameras and microphones — in cold environments. The company has also been putting the hardware through its paces in extra hot climates like Death Valley and Las Vegas. “Thermal stability is a huge thing for cameras to make sure they don’t get distorted by the extreme heat or the extreme cold,” said Karp. Waymo’s fleet of Zeekr test vehicles is still small. In San Francisco, Waymo said it has less than a handful of Zeekrs on the road today. But it’s an interesting moment to introduce a smart vehicle with ties to China. Zeekr is owned by Chinese auto giant Geely Automotive. Earlier this month, the U.S. Commerce Department said it plans to issue proposed rules on connected vehicles in August and expects to impose limits on software made in China and other adversarial countries. This comes a few weeks after U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin soft launched a bill that she plans to introduce to Congress that would limit or ban the introduction of Chinese connected vehicles. To be clear, the Waymo-Zeekr vehicle doesn’t include software or sensors produced by Zeekr. The vehicles are designed and engineered in Sweden and the prototype vehicles are manufactured in China. The Waymo Driver, which includes hardware and software, is integrated into the base vehicles in the U.S. To that end, Waymo recently submitted public comments to the Commerce Department’s advance notice of proposed rulemaking on connected vehicles, explaining that the Zeekr-provided base vehicles “have no driving automation or telematics capabilities built into them.” There are, of course, other AV companies with ties to China that are testing in California. The state’s Department of Motor Vehicles, which regulates testing and deployment permits issued to autonomous vehicle companies, told TechCrunch that it aligns its regulations with national regulations. Meaning that until Congress or the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration comes forward with a ruling about Chinese connected vehicles, the DMV will not change the way it issues permits. China connections aside, a spokesperson for the DMV told TechCrunch that Waymo would need to apply to add a new vehicle to its existing drivered and driverless testing permits if it wants to test the Zeekr autonomously. The California Public Utilities Commission, which regulates how AV companies can charge passengers for rides, said that novel vehicles don’t necessarily require a new authorization from the agency. The carrier may need to request certain exemptions to remain in compliance with CPUC regulations, though, like if a purpose-built AV were not equipped with things like a steering wheel or pedals. The Zeekr prototype vehicle has a removable steering wheel, and the goal down the line is to operate it without one.

The FAA said it requires SpaceX to provide that data at least a week before a launch occurs. The launch in question was specifically a flight of 53 of SpaceX’s own Starlink internet satellites loaded onto a Falcon 9 rocket, which took off on August 19, 2022 from Cape Canaveral in Florida. The dollar amount of the fine is shy of the max civil penalty for this kind of infraction, which tops out at $262,666. The lower amount sought by the agency is due to what it determined was the nature of the incident after investigating the specifics. SpaceX now has 30 days to respond to the notice, which is the next step in the process once a proposed fine has been issued and the max possible penalty has been set. Note that at this stage, SpaceX technically doesn’t owe the FAA anything — that comes after SpaceX makes its case and the FAA evaluates its fine proposal in light of any info they share, and determine a final actual fine to issue.

The new funding comes as Voyager continues its development of the station, Starlab, which is no doubt an enormously capital-intensive undertaking. The funding includes participation from NewSpace Capital, Midway Venture Partners and Industrious Ventures, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings and other documents viewed by TechCrunch. Seraphim Space also participated, TechCrunch has confirmed. The funding was filed with the SEC on January 27. In October 2021, Voyager announced it was developing “Starlab,” a completely private space station, in partnership with Nanoracks (which is majority owned by Voyager) and Lockheed Martin. The project, which is not the only private station currently under development, is in part in response to the impending retirement of the International Space Station by the end of the decade. NASA has already provided a large bulk of funding to Voyager, as well as two separate projects led by Blue Origin and Northrop Grumman. Starlab was awarded $160 million to further develop its plans under the agency’s Commercial low Earth orbit (LEO) Destinations program. In a recent report, NASA’s Office of Inspector General said that a habitable station in LEO was vital to conducting research needed to support human exploration missions to the moon and Mars.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/07/whatsapp-avatars-rollout/,WhatsApp starts rolling out 3D avatars,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us WhatsApp has started rolling out 3D avatars for its users around the globe that can be used as profile photos or custom stickers — months after their debut on Instagram, Facebook and Messenger. On Wednesday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook that avatars are coming to WhatsApp. The announcement follows a months-long beta testing that was first reported by WhatsApp beta tracker WABetaInfo in June. In a blog post, WhatsApp said that users could use personalized avatars as their profile photo or choose from one of 36 custom stickers reflecting different emotions and actions. Avatar stickers on WhatsApp look similar to Snap’s Bitmoji or Apple’s Memoji stickers. “Your avatar is a digital version of you that can be created from billions of combinations of diverse hair styles, facial features, and outfits,” the company behind the popular instant messaging app said. WhatsApp also said that users would get style enhancements including lighting, shading and hair style textures over time. Users will be able to create their avatars on WhatsApp — once rolled out — by going to the Settings menu. The messaging app will also get a “Use Avatar” option in the profile photo settings to let users make their virtual lookalike as a profile photo, per the details available on an FAQ page. In 2019, Meta introduced Bitmoji-style 3D avatars to Facebook and Messenger. The initial rollout was limited to markets including Australia, New Zealand, Europe and Canada, though the social networking giant later expanded its presence to the U.S. in 2020. Instagram also received avatars in late January. WhatsApp confirmed to TechCrunch that, at the moment, you cannot use your WhatsApp’s avatar on Instagram or Facebook, nor can you use your Meta avatar from Instagram or Facebook on WhatsApp. This means that to use an avatar on WhatsApp, you need to create a new avatar within WhatsApp only.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/09/henrik-fisker-geeta-salary-bankruptcy-ocean/,Henrik Fisker drops salary to $1 to keep Fisker Inc. bankruptcy case alive,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Fisker Inc. co-founders Henrik Fisker and his wife, Geeta Gupta-Fisker, are lowering their salaries to $1 in order to keep their failed EV startup’s bankruptcy proceedings funded, as lawyers work to complete a sale of its remaining inventory. Fisker Inc.’s restructuring officer, John DiDonato, said in a Tuesday morning filing that the couple , who co-founded the startup in 2016, made the decision July 8 — just five days after he was grilled about the issue by Linda Richenderfer, a lawyer for the office of the U.S. Trustee. In that July 3 hearing, Richenderfer asked DiDonato whether the Fiskers were still on the payroll. Richenderfer wanted to be sure that every other option had been exhausted given that the lawyers for the company were asking the court to approve an expedited sale of Fisker’s EVs (at least the ones designed for North America) in order to fund the rest of the Chapter 11 case. Those funds are meant to cover legal proceedings and the wind-down of the company. DiDonato stumbled trying to recall what Henrik and Geeta were currently being paid but told Richenderfer that their salaries were “undertaking a modification” and possibly “some deferrals.” It’s still not clear what the couple were being paid every other week as the company slid into bankruptcy. The company said in a regulatory filing last year that it paid them a minimum-wage salary in 2022, which at the time in California was $62,400. But they were each additionally paid cash bonuses of $710,000. In addition to the salary reductions, DiDonato said in Tuesday’s filing that Fisker will defer “certain severance payments, certain employee healthcare benefits, and vehicle sale incentive bonuses” that have not yet been paid. Most of Fisker’s workforce, which was around 1,300 in September 2023, has been whittled down to about 130 people. All of this comes as the company is pushing to sell more than 3,000 of its remaining Ocean SUVs to American Lease, a New York-area company that mainly serves ride-hail drivers, in a deal that is supposed to net around $46.25 million. And while Fisker is in agreement to make that sale to American Lease, another potential buyer has approached the startup — but that unknown party is under NDA and it’s not been made clear what, exactly, they might want and what they’d be willing to pay. A lawyer for Fisker said at the July 3 hearing that the plan was to parcel out about 200 Oceans to American Lease at a time, due, in part, to a problem with the EV’s water pump that can cause the high-voltage battery to lose power. Fisker needs to fix that problem on every car before it can be sold because the part is now under an official recall with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. With the cost-saving measures DiDonato laid out, along with additional cash coming in from prior vehicle auctions and interest on bank accounts, Fisker now thinks it can fund the case over the next few weeks. A final decision on the approval of the sale to American Lease is now not expected until July 16. “I think holding the hearing on that date allows a little more breathing room for the parties and potential other events,” Brian Resnick of Davis Polk, who represents Fisker in the bankruptcy case, said in a hearing Tuesday morning. That includes the potential new buyer for Fisker’s assets, Resnick said, but he added: “We’re certainly not taking our eye off the ball” on the American Lease transaction. In the interim, the fight between Fisker’s lone secured creditor — Heights Capital Management, an affiliate of financial services company Susquehanna International Group — and its many unsecured lenders continues. A committee of unsecured creditors was finally formed last week, and their legal representation got its first chance to speak at Tuesday’s hearing. That lawyer, Doug Mannal of Morrison Foerster LLP, didn’t waste the moment. He spent about 10 minutes of the roughly 30-minute hearing building on claims, frustrations and allegations made by another lawyer who spoke on behalf of an unsecured creditor in the first Chapter 11 hearing on June 21. Mannal’s speech aimed to deliver the court a message: The committee of unsecured creditors is uncomfortable with the way that Heights wound up first in line for all of Fisker’s assets. Heights extended around $500 million worth of loans to Fisker in 2023. That debt was not secured by any collateral, but instead could be converted into Fisker stock. When Fisker was late in filing its third-quarter financial results in late 2023, that breached one of the covenants of the deal with Heights. Somehow — and it’s still unclear exactly what happened here — Fisker’s way of making good with Heights was to pledge all of its assets as collateral for the remaining debt. “What would be a relatively benign event in most other situations has had a dramatic impact” on Fisker, Mannal said in the hearing. He also noted that the covenant breach allowed Heights to convert and sell Fisker stock at a juicy premium, essentially turning $1 into $1.60 by flipping it on the open market. Mannal accused Heights of using Fisker as a “money tree” and claimed they’ve already made back far more than the value of the original loans. He therefore questioned why Heights is still claiming to be owed more than $180 million — debt that remains collateralized by all of Fisker’s assets — when the unsecured creditors are collectively owed around $1 billion. Scott Greissman, a partner at White & Case LLP who represents Heights, said the firm “has at all times acted within the four corners of a series of contracts” with Fisker. He reminded the court that Fisker was a publicly traded company with a board of directors and “fine counsel,” all of whom oversaw the negotiations of the original loans and the agreement to repair the breach. “Your Honor, similar to the first day hearing, different law firm, same allegations, perhaps a little more dramatic, we don’t think it’s appropriate necessarily at all to respond to any of these allegations that Mr. Mannal has stated on the record almost in the form of testimony,” Greissman said. “We are very concerned that the [unsecured creditors’] committee’s approach to the case will destroy value rather than enhance it.” (One way the committee of unsecured creditors is already trying to “enhance” the value of what’s left at Fisker: It was the one that found the new potential buyer.) Whichever way the next few weeks go, Greissman stressed the point that, though Fisker entered a Chapter 11 proceeding, Heights sees this as a liquidation and little else. “Every dollar expended is unrecoverable,” he said. “Even an approved sale won’t necessarily sustain a Chapter 11 case, especially a highly litigious one.” Topics Sr. Reporter, Transportation LIMITED TIME: Save $300+ on your ticket, plus an additional 50% on a second for a full immersive day of AI!

While it’s still a very early market with limited existing capabilities, companies such as Apple, T-Mobile, Globalstar, SpaceX, AST SpaceMobile and Lynk Global are targeting this area. Multiple mobile network operators are already on board, even before some of the first operational spacecraft have been launched. Apple has partnered with Globalstar to provide SOS connectivity with its new iPhone 14 , and T-Mobile is planning to begin low-earth orbit (LEO) connectivity in 2023 through SpaceX, which recently filed an application with the US FCC to include direct-to-cellular capabilities in its Gen 2 Starlink satellites. Amazon is also set to launch its first batch of LEO satellites for Project Kuiper . Most of these early projects will not provide high-speed broadband from space, and will instead offer low-bandwidth connectivity suitable for emergency calls and texts. All of this aims to service the currently underserved population around the world, which does not live within reach of traditional cell tower networks. Extensive government and commercial efforts are underway to head “back to the Moon” decades after the Apollo program finished in 1972. This has been kicked off by NASA’s Artemis program, which saw the Artemis 1 mission’s Orion capsule returning to Earth after spending almost a month traveling around the Moon. At almost the same time, the first fully-privately-funded lunar mission was launched by SpaceX for Japanese company iSpace, which is taking a fuel-efficient trip to the Moon and is due to get there in April. This would be the first fully commercial mission to land on the Moon, a milestone in the cooperation between Japan and the U.S. in space. Other commercial companies, such as Intuitive Machines and Astrobotic, are also targeting Moon landings. With the first commercial companies headed moonward alongside national efforts, we expect 2023 to be a breakthrough year for the cislunar ecosystem. Developments in the defense, cybersecurity and climate sectors will prove to be strong tailwinds for revenues in spacetech in 2023. Record growth in defense budgets driven by the war in Ukraine and rising geopolitical tensions will drive business, and governments’ increasing desire for sovereign capability from space assets will lead to some huge orders in the sector. And, since cybersecurity is another tool in the geopolitical toolbox, satellite resilience against attacks is a priority. A growing reliance on datasets generated in orbit means the security demands for the flow of data from the satellite to the cloud and ground stations are growing exponentially. We see 2023 as the year when the industry embraces quantum capabilities. Finally, the link between space and climate is now clearer than ever, as novel data collected from space helps to unlock previously hidden insights about the Earth’s surface and atmosphere, which feed into climate change models. We have seen investment in such startups growing steadily over the past few years, and expect this trend to accelerate in 2023. While certain countries have had space agencies for decades, many more have been set up in recent years. In the past decade alone, new space agencies were set up in various countries, including Azerbaijan, Costa Rica, UAE, Portugal and New Zealand. Four new space agencies were created in 2021, and Croatia, Iceland, Oman, Yemen, Singapore, and members of the African Union have announced plans to form space agencies in 2023. With these agencies will come greater cooperation in space and greater progress towards in-space and cislunar activities. Despite the economic uncertainty, rising interest rates, soaring inflation and recession, we believe new records will be established in spacetech as giant commercial projects get funded. While the second half of 2022 saw a dip in growth-stage funding rounds, we believe several mega-rounds will close in 2023, producing another record year. SpaceX has been expanding beyond its initial beachhead launch market. With nearly 3,500 satellites, SpaceX is increasingly diversifying its Space offerings, moving ever closer to being a fully integrated space services provider. In December 2022, SpaceX revealed another new business line called Starshield , which will offer Earth observation capabilities to U.S. Government agencies. Ultimately, in the coming year, this may be one of the forces driving consolidation in the ecosystem. Space sustainability has become a priority for agencies and regulators globally. While 2022 saw the FCC reducing the timeframes for satellite operators to de-orbit their satellites post-mission completion from 25 years to just five years, we expect to see regulators implementing further restrictions in 2023 through launch licensing. This is great news for the growing list of companies offering debris removal, life extension, and in-orbit servicing and refuelling.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/17/stell-wants-to-modernize-the-unsexy-workflows-slowing-down-americas-industrial-base/,Stell wants to modernize the ‘unsexy’ workflows slowing down America’s industrial base,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us There is very little room for error in aerospace and defense (A&D) manufacturing. For companies that build products like missiles, rocket boosters and avionics, each part must not deviate more than a hairsbreadth from its technical specifications. Despite the precise demands of the industry, however, parts ordering is generally done using systems that are only slightly better than carrier pigeon: generally some combination of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, long-text PDFs attached to email or an A&D company’s internal portal. Communication between companies and suppliers about these highly technical parts can also be bogged down by similarly low-tech, human-driven errors, like forgetting to copy someone on an email. “I had this crazy theory that nothing can really move forward in terms of automation until all of that text, all of those decisions, get digitized,” Malory McLemore said in a recent interview with TechCrunch. To solve this problem, McLemore and Anne Wen founded Stell , a startup that’s building a platform to bring new workflows to parts ordering. The company, which is less than six months old, just closed an oversubscribed $3.1 million pre-seed round led by Wischoff Ventures and Third Prime VC as it gears up to expand its team and build out its product. The company is hoping that its platform can reduce error and improve efficiency — two variables that will be key to shoring up America’s industrial base. Stell was still just a “crazy theory” when McLemore embarked on an MBA at Harvard Business School. That’s where she met Anne Wen, a fellow graduate who had experience getting space startups off the ground. The idea continued to germinate, but ultimately both McLemore and Wen completed the program unsure of how to move forward. “We left school feeling like we couldn’t figure out how to make this business work,” McLemore explained. “Selling software to aerospace and defense is hard. There aren’t a lot of solutions competing with the big guys for a reason.” McLemore has seen how the A&D supply chain functions up close while working for both established aerospace behemoths and disruptive machining startups. Her experience includes stints at Airbus and Raytheon, where she helped build anti-ballistic missiles and airplanes. Most recently, she was machining-parts startup Hadrian’s first product manager. This experience gave her a look into the parts-ordering process from the perspective of the customer, at Raytheon, and the supplier, at Hadrian. On both ends, she was confronted with inefficiencies, missed deadlines and pointless errors. Even a startup like Hadrian, with millions in funding from the likes of Andreessen Horowitz and Lux Capital, still had to deal with the same inefficient inputs from the OEMs. “Hadrian’s customers were still sending PDFs and emails to Hadrian,” she said. “Even if Hadrian builds this totally robotic, autonomous factory, all the inputs to the process are still broken.” “So I called Anne, and I was like, I think I know how we can do this.” When it comes to parts ordering in A&D, it is not only the technical specifications that need to be communicated to suppliers. Often, parts need to be inspected in certain ways, or tested; those results need to be communicated back to the customer. McLemore said Stell’s platform would also include room for these key deliverables and provide space for communication with customers directly within the software. That the A&D industry has such outdated workflows may seem surprising, but up until now there has been very little pressure on the biggest companies to change their systems. McLemore pointed to the outsized power of this very small, very powerful group of primes relative to the suppliers. But the landscape is changing: More venture capital is pouring into aerospace and defense startups, and there’s increasing pressure to secure these critical supply chains by bringing manufacturing back to American machine shops. Suppliers could have more leverage to demand better workflows, which McLemore says benefits both customers and suppliers. Other things are changing too: Legacy primes have historically been disincentivized from changing any process because it introduces uncertainty and risk. But Stell is hoping competitive pressure from outside the traditional industrial base will also nudge them to rethink their systems while not sacrificing mission assurance. Right now, Stell is “running full speed,” Wen said; she and McLemore are in the process of onboarding Stell’s first dedicated software engineer and are thinking ahead to a design hire. They’re also planning on registering under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), the series of regulations that govern technologies related to U.S. defense. The company is aiming to get an alpha prototype to one-two customers by April. That test period will last until summer; once concluded, McLemore and Wen plan to launch to the industry at-large. The story has been edited to clarify the parts-ordering process. Topics Reporter, Space and Defense Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/11/metas-vision-for-the-future-of-vr-is-a-worse-version-of-the-past/,Meta’s vision for the future of VR is a worse version of the past,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Meta keeps saying VR is the future, but everything it shows us is an inferior rehash of the things we already have. Its event today was, between assurances that everything is great in the Metaverse, a collection of tacit admissions that the best they can hope to do is ape a reality we are all desperately trying to leave behind. The silliest example of this is the new capability to enter a Meta VR environment through an embed on a website. This was described as perhaps the first way many people will experience a virtual environment. It’s hard to know where to start with this notion. With the no doubt internally depressing acceptance that $1,000 VR hardware doesn’t scale well and most people can’t be bothered to try it? With the idea that a shared 3D environment is a new experience? Or that this is something that people actually want to do? Of course people have shared virtual environments for decades. When it’s viewed on a regular monitor, it’s no different than Second Life or World of Warcraft, or any other of the popular games and platforms that have come and gone (and come again) over the years. The difference is those had a reason to exist: being a game you can progress and share hundreds of hours of unique experiences in, for instance. Meta’s environment is just that: an environment. It’s hard to imagine why anyone would want to join via this web interface unless they had no other option, like if the meeting was only being held in VR. But of course Meta has had trouble even getting its own employees to do that. Meanwhile most people in the world are waiting for VR to be worth the price of a gaming console or laptop. Today’s presentation didn’t really make much progress there. In fact there was an alarming and baffling reiteration of an idea that I thought we left behind a long time ago: a virtual desk. This concept has been cursed for decades, since the most notable failure in the domain: the infamous Microsoft Bob . Meta has very unwisely recreated Bob, a virtual desktop, in ways that have no benefits whatsoever. You can have a worse experience reading emails or a worse video call, or play games and watch movies on a worse screen. Notably there was very little showing what working at a virtual desk would actually look like, because most of the things people take for granted — effortless multitasking, quick switching between cursor and typing, easy compatibility with apps and websites — don’t exist in VR. Sure, they’re partnering with Microsoft and Accenture and so on, but even so, would Slack or Teams be better in VR or worse? Like nearly everything, the answer is worse. Virtual meetings with everyone around a virtual office table sound like a nightmare to me. The most telling piece was the admission that the subtleties of human expression are important to communication — someone’s unique smile or posture, a moment of eye contact when the boss flubs a line in a presentation. Their solution is, like nearly everything Meta does, technically impressive and completely misguided. The new headset tracks facial expressions and gaze, meaning it can replicate these in a decent way in a virtual environment on your new avatars with legs and everything. Meta announces legs But it’s so plainly a poor recreation of the real thing, and video calls — for all the issues they have — are actually quite good at catching those little expressions and moments. VR meetings with the expression-tracking tech may be better than VR meetings without, but any VR meeting is still a huge pain in the ass that no one, including the faithful at Meta, would do regularly if they had a choice. Not only that, but working long term within VR doesn’t make sense in most ways, as Meta again admitted without explicitly saying so. The new Quest Pro headset actually has removable eye cups so you can see the real world in your periphery, in order to take some notes, grab your coffee and so on. They literally cut holes in the headset so you could do normal things that ought to be possible with their much-vaunted mixed reality. Fortunately you won’t have to worry about that because the battery life is very limited. Even if your boss wanted you to be in virtual meetings all day, the headset would conk out before lunch. Meta wants you to drop $1,499 on a headset to… go to work Isn’t the entire world trying to think past the idea of the office, of the meeting-filled workday, of the traditional form of work that’s essentially a relic of the postwar era? Why would anyone want to cling to these paradigms, unless they had no ideas about what actually comes next? It’s funny because VR is such a powerful technology, as anyone who has used it even once can attest. But Meta, its biggest proponent, doesn’t seem to know what to do with it beyond “what you already do, but worse.” So little of what it showed today suggested the future, and so much clawed at the past to find a crack into which to inject VR — hoping someone, somewhere might agree with them that appearing as a VR avatar in Zoom is something that makes sense. “Is it this? Is this the killer app for VR?” they seem to be asking. Needless to say it isn’t. And judging from the company’s inability to innovate at a large scale over the last several years, it may not be capable of finding it.

The e-fuels startup is working on producing fuel for aviation and maritime shipping using carbon dioxide and other waste carbon streams. The new round would give the company’s bank account a healthy bump; Aether Fuels had previously raised $8.5 million via convertible notes in late 2023. The startup was spun out of Xora Innovation, an early-stage, deep-tech incubator run by Temasek. A company spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Since then, Aether Fuels has been working to refine its technology. The company says that its technology can use carbon from a range of waste streams, including industrial pollution, methane from landfills and leftover plant debris from farms. Not much is publicly known about exactly how Aether Fuels converts carbon dioxide to fuels, though a patent application filed in January suggests the company is exploring one avenue that involves using natural gas. The process gasifies solid waste, blends it with natural gas and then transforms the mix into a liquid fuel (with any waste carbon dioxide captured along the way). In February, it announced a deal that gave it access to a gas-to-liquid program started by GTI Energy, a natural gas nonprofit. Airlines and maritime shipping companies have been pursuing bio-derived sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and e-fuels as a way to decarbonize their energy-intensive industries. However, those efforts have been nascent at best. The amount of SAF produced today, for example, only amounts to less than 0.1% of total use, and SAF is a much more mature industry than e-fuels.

The agency announced Wednesday that it has selected Rocket Lab to launch its Time-Resolved Observations of Precipitation structure and storm Intensity with a Constellation of Smallsats (TROPICS) satellites across two launches in late spring of next year. The missions, which will take place no earlier than May 1, will carry two cubesats each. Given that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has licensed the launches, it’s safe to infer that they will take place in Virginia, Rocket Lab’s sole site for U.S.-based launches. Until now, the company has exclusively launched from Mahia Peninsula, New Zealand, though it is hoping to change that with a maiden launch from Virginia on December 7. Just which launch company NASA would choose for the TROPICS missions has been an open question for the past two months, ever since the agency announced that its initial partner, Astra, would no longer conduct the launches. Astra’s contract, valued at $7.95 million, was for three launches on its Rocket 3.3 vehicle — a rocket that Astra later announced would be discontinued, in favor of a larger and more powerful Rocket 4. But Rocket 4 is still under development — and may not be ready to launch until 2024. NASA decided not to wait that long, and said in September that it would modify the TROPICS launch contract with Astra for “comparable scientific payloads” on the new rocket. Astra attempted just one of the three contracted TROPICS launches back in June, but both satellites were lost after the rocket’s second stage encountered an issue and shut down prior to payload deployment. Rocket Lab is one of 13 companies part of NASA’s Venture-class Acquisition of Dedicated and Rideshare (VADR) launch services contract, a new program designed for payloads that have a high risk tolerance. The companies in the VADR program range from veritable veterans of launch, like SpaceX, to startups that have yet to fly their first rocket, like ABL Space Systems and Relativity.

Now, we’re in a period often called “New Space,” in which commercial ventures are leading the way in carving out new markets and use cases for space. But as the past five years have vividly illustrated, government and defense have come to play a pivotal role in funding and shaping this new market environment. Whether it’s NASA paying out for commercial space station ventures or the U.S. Space Force (USSF) funding novel satellite technologies, it’s clear that private-public partnerships are an integral part of the space industry. That’s why we’re thrilled that Steve Jurczyk, CEO of Quantum Space, and USSF officer Colonel Joseph Roth will join us onstage for a panel discussion at TC Sessions: Space on December 6 in Los Angeles. In a session titled “Building Out Commercial Operations in Orbit,” we’ll hear from the panelists on how private companies can work with defense and government partners to create positive-sum relationships. We’ll also hear their thoughts on how startups can navigate bureaucratic hoops and ensure they’re giving the customer — like NASA, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) or the USSF — exactly what they need. How are public-private partnerships arranged, and how can startups and commercial ventures use them to pave the way to a profitable business case? Be in the room for what promises to be a fascinating and informative conversation. Steve Jurczyk co-founded Quantum Space, an infrastructure and services company aimed at revolutionizing the way satellites operate in and travel through space beyond Earth orbit, in 2021 and currently serves as its CEO. Prior to Quantum, Jurczyk held numerous leadership roles at NASA — which he joined in 1988 — including associate administrator, the agency’s highest-ranking civil servant, and the associate administrator of the Space Technology Mission Directorate. In this position he formulated and executed the agency’s space technology programs, focusing on developing and demonstrating transformative technologies for human and robotic exploration of the solar system in partnership with industry and academia. He previously served as director of NASA’s Langley Research Center where he headed NASA’s first field Center, which plays a critical role in the agency’s aeronautics research, exploration and science missions. Jurczyk received his Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Electrical Engineering from the University of Virginia He is an associate fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Colonel Joseph J. Roth serves as Director, Innovation and Prototyping Acquisition Delta and Commander, Space Systems Center, Detachment 1, Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M. Roth leads a combined team of more than 740 military, government civilians and contractors at four geographically separated units and manages a $3.8 billion portfolio to rapidly transition and deliver war-winning space concepts, technologies and capabilities to the United States Space Force and mission partners across the National Security Space community. The Innovation and Prototyping Directorate conducts test and experimentation, prototyping, demonstrations, and operations of innovative space systems and technology for the Space Systems Center. The Directorate also executes the Space Test Program on behalf of the Department of Defense. Colonel Roth has served in a diverse variety of positions across the Air Force and Department of Defense. He has served as Minuteman III ICBM combat crew commander; an acquisition program manager at the National Reconnaissance Office; a branch chief on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Headquarters Air Force; an executive officer at Headquarters Air Force Materiel Command, and commander of the 333d Recruiting Squadron. takes place on December 6 in Los Angeles.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/05/facebook-new-ways-customize-what-you-see-feed/,Facebook is rolling out new ways to customize what you see in your feed,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Facebook is rolling out new ways for users to customize their feed, the social network announced on Wednesday. Beginning today, you will start to see new “Show more” or “Show less” buttons on posts from the people and communities that you’re connected to or on posts that are recommended to you. Facebook is also going to start testing the the new feature with Reels. The company says that if you select the “Show more” option, it will temporarily increase the ranking score for that post and similar ones. If you select the “Show less” option, you will temporarily decrease its ranking score. A spokesperson from Facebook told TechCrunch that the selections you make influence the posts you see for 60 days. The company says it chose this time frame because its research showed that people want these preferences to last for at least a few weeks, and also because Facebook wants to keep up with peoples’ changing preferences. Currently, Facebook only lets you hide posts from people you follow or those it suggests. Now, the company is rolling out tools for posts from your friends and recommended posts. Facebook will periodically show the “Show less” and “Show more” options to users. Soon, users will be able to access the buttons at any time by tapping into the three-dot menu in the upper-right hand corner. The social network says that by giving users a new way to provide direct feedback about ranking, it will be able to make its AI systems smarter and more responsive. Facebook also announced today that it’s testing new settings to allow users to customize how much content they see in their feed from the friends and family, Groups, Pages and public figures they’re connected to. The new settings will allow users to select which posts they want to see more or less. For instance, you can choose to see a “normal” amount of posts from your friends and family, while choosing to see “less” posts from the pages and public figures you follow. “Features like these can help you discover more of the content that’s valuable to you, so you can see more of what you want and less of what you don’t,” the company said in a blog post. “As with every product change we make, we’ll use direct feedback to continually refine our approach.” With the changes announced today, it’s possible that Facebook is looking to address complaints from users who say their feed is filled with too many posts that they’re not actually interested in. The new user controls should help address these issues by giving users more control over the content that appears in their feeds. It’s also worth noting that Facebook likely wants to better train its algorithm to learn which posts and Reels people actually want to see, especially as its parent company Meta competes with TikTok, which is notorious for its game-changing algorithm . Considering that Facebook will test the new controls with Reels, Facebook likely is looking for ways to get more people engaged with its short-form video product.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/23/paris-transit-passes-now-available-in-iphones-wallet-app/,Paris transit passes now available in iPhone’s Wallet app,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us After multiple delays, Apple and the Paris area transportation authority rolled out support for Paris transit passes in Apple Wallet. It means that people can now use their iPhone or Apple Watch as a Navigo pass to ride the metro, train, tram or bus. This is important news for Île-de-France Mobilités (IDFM) — the transportation authority — as millions of people are expected to come to Paris this summer for the Olympic Games. Android users have been able to use their phone as a Navigo pass for a while. The Apple integration is also the result of years of negotiations with the tech company as IDFM doesn’t rely on Apple Pay, Visa or Mastercard to enable this feature. Instead, the iPhone emulates a Navigo card using the built-in NFC chip. Yesterday, I created a virtual Navigo pass and used it to ride the metro, and it worked as expected. There are two ways to create a virtual Navigo pass. You can either do it from the official transportation authority app or directly in Apple Wallet. For tourists who don’t want to download another app, adding a transit pass is pretty easy. You can open the Wallet app, tap the + button and add a Navigo card. After that, you can buy one ticket or more and pay with Apple Pay. When you’re entering the metro, you can use your iPhone to “tap to ride.” You can either double-click on the iPhone side button and select the Navigo pass, or enable Express Mode. In the latter case, you can tap your iPhone near a reader, and it’ll select the Navigo pass automatically without having to unlock or wake your iPhone. Every time you use your iPhone as a transit pass, you receive a notification that informs you how many tickets you have left. You can also see that information in the Wallet app and buy more tickets whenever you want. The new feature is also compatible with power reserve — if you run out of battery, you can still use your transit pass with Express Mode for a few hours. And if you lose your device, you can remotely lock it using the Find My app from another device — it will disable Express Mode. So if you’re a tourist and visiting Paris, there’s no need to visit ticketing vending machines anymore. However, if you live in Paris and you have an annual or Liberté+ subscription, you won’t be able to add your transit pass to Apple Wallet until 2025 . In other Paris news, Apple also added real-time transit information. While most people rely on Citymapper or Bonjour RATP to get around the city, you can now tap on a train station or bus stop to see the next departures. This summer, Apple will also add 3D renderings of the Parisian venues for the summer games.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/08/skyroot-kickstart-india-launch/,Skyroot wants to kickstart private spaceflight in India with first rocket launch next week,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Spaceflight startup Skyroot wants to make history by launching India’s first privately developed rocket, and it’s aiming to do so as early as next week. The company said Tuesday that the first launch of the Vikram-S suborbital rocket could occur as early as November 12, with a launch window that extends until November 16. The launch will take place from the Indian Space Research Organization ’s Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota. The final date is dependent on weather conditions. Vikram-S is a suborbital, single-stage launch vehicle. For this demonstration mission, named Prarambh, or “the beginning” in Sanskrit, the rocket will carry three customer payloads. Details on the payloads were not announced. The Hyderabad-based Skyroot is developing a series of Vikram launch vehicles, so named after the founder of India’s space program, Vikram Sarabhai. Naga Bharath Daka, Skyroot COO and co-founder, said in a statement that the Vikram-S suborbital rocket will be used to test and validate the technologies used in the series. The launch could mark the beginning of a new era of private spaceflight in India, a country with a national space program but a relatively small private space sector. The country has already made moves to change that; in June 2020, the government passed major reforms to the space sector, including establishing the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Center (IN-SPACe) to facilitate private companies using ISRO infrastructure. The government also set up NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), the ISRO’s commercial arm. (Most recently, NSIL facilitated the launch of 36 OneWeb satellites on an Indian rocket.) Last month, Skyroot announced it had raised $51 million in Series B financing led by Singapore-based investment firm GIC. It brings the startup’s total funding to $68 million to date, making it the most well-funded Indian space startup in operation.

Pixxel is poised to change that with its hyperspectral imaging satellites, and co-founder Awais Ahmed will join us at TC Sessions: Space in Los Angeles on December 6 to tell us why this tech matters. Hyperspectral imagery includes wavelengths well beyond what people and traditional cameras see, allowing satellites to detect things like polluting gases, the hydration level of soil or concentrations of desirable minerals. Pixxel’s approach is modern and adaptable, with a new imaging stack that slices the wider spectrum into extremely thin slices, allowing very specific detections that would normally take a spectrometer or science mission. Pixxel raised a $25 million A round earlier this year, a coup for the young founders, Ahmed and Kshitij Khandelwal, his fellow graduate from BITS Pilani in Rajasthan, India. The two set out to change orbital imagery and are now in pole position as numerous industries, the military, and climate-monitoring authorities are all seeing the benefits of hyperspectral image data. Ahmed told TechCrunch recently that the new push toward ESG, as well as a large new tranche of federal funding for climate solutions, is reinforcing existing interest from stakeholders in this area, from climate activists to gas and oil companies. And of course the strategic importance of this type of data is easy to see, which is why Ahmed will be joining us for a discussion of the evolving dual-use sector where startups like Pixxel have twice the opportunity — but also double the responsibility. Melanie Stricklan, the CEO and co-founder of Slingshot Aerospace, will also join the discussion and weigh in on how startups and growing companies can better understand and navigate the complex world of dual use.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/02/rivian-827-million-incentives-r2-illinois/,Rivian wins $827M incentive package to expand Illinois factory for R2 production,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Rivian is getting $827 million in incentives from the state of Illinois to support building its next-generation electric vehicle, known as the R2. The company announced Thursday that the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity will dole out the funds, which will be used to expand the automaker’s existing factory in Normal, Illinois, to build out supporting infrastructure and boost job training programs for its workforce. Updates to the factory will begin “in the coming months.” The funding announcement comes just two months after Rivian unveiled the midsize R2 SUV, which is supposed to start at around $45,000 when it goes on sale in 2026. It also plans to make and sell a hatchback called the R3 that is powered by the same EV platform that underpins the R2. Rivian had initially planned to build the R2 at a brand-new $5 billion factory in Georgia. But the company announced at the R2 event in March that it had decided instead to build the R2 in Illinois, where it currently makes the R1T pickup, the R1S SUV and its commercial electric vans. The decision to pivot away from the Georgia plant allows the startup to move up the timeline for the R2 SUV and save more than $2 billion. Rivian has said it remains committed to building the factory in Georgia. But the company’s continued losses and struggles to scale production — it will make around the same number of EVs this year as it did last year — forced it to rethink its plans for the next-generation vehicle. Rivian stands to receive $1.5 billion in incentives from Georgia if it ever builds a factory there. That incentives package, the biggest in the state’s history, comes with several commitments from Rivian, including that it will hire 7,500 people who will earn an average annual salary of $56,000 by the end of 2028. Under the agreement, Rivian has agreed to continued maintenance of these jobs through 2047. Rivian has to make repayments to the state and joint development authority (JDA) in any year in which it is 80% below its maintenance.

Solestial is ready to change that with space-grade panels built using inexpensive, scalable processes, and it just raised $10 million to take its tech from lab to orbit. The company, formerly known as Regher Solar, has its roots in years of academic research at Arizona State University into the possibility of achieving the performance of space-grade cells with the materials and methods used for terrestrial solar panels. When TechCrunch last spoke to Solestial , it was at the prototype stage, demonstrating that its bare solar cell could withstand the harsh environment of space despite projected costs being one-tenth as much as standard “III/IV” category panels. “That’s really the foundation of our product, a solar cell that isn’t afraid of radiation; it has this unique feature of self-curing radiation damage,” said CEO and co-founder Stanislau Herasimenka — referring to the low-temperature heat curing their cells undergo at 80 degrees C, which purges flaws created by radiation. “But people don’t buy bare solar cells,” he continued. Even if the cells themselves work as advertised, no one wants to have to assemble them into panels themselves. Solestial has to prove that not just its proprietary cells but the interconnects, extra-thin silicon substrate and other components can also survive 10 years in orbit. That means a lot of tests are in order. Fortunately the funding and a lot of potential customers have come through to support the company in its quest to displace the costly dedicated in-space panels — because there’s no way enough of those could be built to support the number of satellites going up over the next decade. Although the goal is 10 years in space, it is of course impractical to test out there for that long. So the full panel assemblies are undergoing accelerated stress testing, where they’re exposed to more intense and varied radiation than they would normally see out there, as well as rapid temperature shifts and things like that. This is commonplace in space work — it’s not like you can go to the moon to test stuff you need to go to the moon, so you do your best to simulate it on Earth. “Our customers want to help us get flight heritage; we already delivered several small solar panels for demo flights, we expect lots over the next year,” Herasimenka said. This is in addition to the stress testing and working on the manufacturing process: “Customers also want to see we’re capable of mass producing this thing, that our tech can smoothly be transferred from pilot production to high-scale production.” Regher Solar is ready to meet the new space industry’s demand for cheaper, better solar panels Mass production is on the roadmap for about two years from now, he added, at which point the company expects to be able to make tens of thousands of panels and hopefully supply future constellations and large-scale installations. It won’t be cheap, which is why the seed round, which Herasimenka told me a year ago would be closed in a matter of months, instead took a year and is twice as large. “We were advised we needed more money, and I absolutely agreed with that, given the scope of what we’re doing. It’s hard tech, it’s early stage and we need to do additional validation work,” he said of the delayed raise. The new round was led by Airbus Ventures, with participation from AEI HorizonX, GPVC, Stellar Ventures, Industrious Ventures and others. Solestial previously collected about $2.5 million in SBIR awards, but those are meant to validate the theory, not scale the company. Though they’re just getting started, Herasimenka was confident they’ll be a major supplier of solar panels to the next generation of spacecraft, but that they intend to branch out and become a broader power provider — hence the name change from Regher Solar to Solestial. “It’s not like we hated the name, but we wanted one that better reflected our ambition to be a solar energy in space company. We don’t want to stay a boring solar panel manufacturer forever, so we wanted a name that will grow with us as a brand,” he said. It may be two years at a minimum until the first batch comes off the production line, but Solestial is already looking past that horizon. A communications satellite may last 8-10 years, but what about larger craft in higher orbits? What about large-scale lunar mining operations? They’d welcome a space-hardened solar solution that doesn’t break the bank, but it’ll have to last 20 years or more. That’s the next strategic step for Solestial, but first it has to get its flagship product out the door. Topics Writer & Photographer Devin Coldewey is a Seattle-based writer and photographer.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/24/starlink-signals-could-work-as-gps-alternative-whether-spacex-likes-it-or-not/,"Starlink signals could work as GPS alternative, whether SpaceX likes it or not",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us With some 3,000 satellites in orbit, the Starlink constellation is easily the largest in history and of course presents an immense opportunity for global connectivity. But its signals could also be analyzed and used as an alternative to traditional GPS, a new paper claims, with or without SpaceX’s blessing. Todd Humphreys and his team at the University of Texas Austin dove into the “signal structure” of the Starlink downlink, and while there’s only so much they can learn without insider info from the company itself, they did find plenty of useful data. Satellites must pass their signal down to the ground at some point, and in Starlink’s case it’s pretty much a constant stream. That doesn’t mean anyone can just tap in, though — the signal itself is structured and encoded in a proprietary way that, presumably, SpaceX has decided is best for the kind of orbital broadband it’s providing. The exact parameters of this signal are not known, but in order to make sure packets are arriving in order and intact, the transmission — like any data transmission these days — includes very precise timing data and other telemetry so the receiver and sender can stay in sync. By carefully analyzing an incoming signal from a single satellite and combining that data with what is known about the satellite’s exact position, the time down to the nanosecond, and so on, Humphreys was able to decode the transmission to a certain extent. They document their results in a paper , currently awaiting peer review and publishing. A side effect of having precise telemetry coming from a few satellites (in addition to other measurements like Doppler radar) is that you can use it to work out your exact location, and the paper describes how this might be done. As The Register points out , this idea isn’t new and in fact was being pursued as a possibility years ago, but ultimately SpaceX decided to focus on the consumer side of things. But the scientists at UT Austin had had a taste of the possibilities and decided to pursue it independently with its own rig without SpaceX cooperation. As they write in the paper’s intro: The signal characterization offered herein includes the exact values of synchronization sequences embedded in the signal that can be exploited to produce pseudorange measurements. Such an understanding of the signal is essential to emerging efforts that seek to dual-purpose Starlink signals for positioning, navigation, and timing, despite their being designed solely for broadband Internet provision. To be clear, no one is accessing Starlink user data here. The sync sequences are just strings of timings and other data that the machines use to stay in touch — the payload data is entirely separate. In the paper, due to the fact that the signal was being targeted at an actual Starlink user terminal, the location had to be for that terminal too, and they were able to get it within 30 meters. Not better than GPS, obviously, but it could be quicker and eventually more accurate if SpaceX were to give the project its blessing. Starlink arrives in Antarctica A software update that slightly adjusts how the satellites send their signals and a bit of data on correcting for variance between their clocks, and Humphreys suggests Starlink transmissions could be used to locate oneself to within a meter. It would be a public service and wouldn’t cost SpaceX much of anything to implement, but it’s also a valuable service that no business in its right mind (especially one that just committed to a deeply unprofitable connectivity deal in Ukraine ) would just implement and provide for free. That said, it may be that the genie is out of the bottle — the data in the paper “illuminates the path” to this use, and someone might find a way to make it work no matter what anyone says.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/07/rocket-labs-8th-launch-of-2022-breaks-record-for-worst-pun-in-space/,Rocket Lab’s 8th launch of 2022 breaks record for worst pun in space,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Rocket Lab successfully launched an Electron rocket this afternoon with a new satellite for the Argos program, which provides connectivity to a number of scientific endeavors. It’s a milestone for the company, but more importantly marks — easily — the worst pun ever launched into space. The mission was called “It Argos Up From Here.” The launch (and increasingly, spacecraft) company has always struck a light tone in its mission names, usually in the form of some in-joke or play on words. I fear this one may represent the zenith, or some would say nadir, of this practice. If there’s a worse pun in orbit, it must be classified. But to Rocket Lab it is perhaps more important that this launch is the eighth of the year, breaking their previous record for annual launches. Ultimately, as CEO and founder Peter Beck has said many times, the goal is to provide five to 10 times that number, but it’s not an ambition you can take on all at once. The Argos program is an international one that lets sensors in far-flung places send their data home. It’s often used to track animals in the wild or for other situations where connectivity is uncertain — forests, oceans and so on. While NOAA is one of its chief architects, the system is used by over a hundred countries on a regular basis. The satellite that went up was built by General Atomics and carries the Argos-4 communications array. It was the only payload on the Electron, which by the way Rocket Lab did not attempt to recover this time. They’re probably in the middle of tweaking the catch-and-recover process after their successful demonstration in May . This was the 31st launch by Rocket Lab overall, and it has more planned for 2022. One more from their original launch complex in New Zealand, and then the inaugural launch from LC-2 in Virginia — which we hope to attend.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/16/meta-new-reels-features-instagram-and-facebook-including-add-yours-sticker/,"Meta rolls out new Reels features on Instagram and Facebook, including an ‘Add Yours’ sticker",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us announced today that it’s launching new Reels features for Instagram and Facebook. Most notably, the company is rolling out an “Add Yours” sticker for Reels on both social networks. The sticker allows users to respond to other users’ Reels with their own following a prompt or a certain topic. For example, you can share a Reel with an Add Yours prompt that asks others to post videos of their pets. Each time you share a new Add Yours prompt, Reels added by others will appear on a page dedicated to that prompt. At the top of the page, people will see who started the prompt in order to give credit to the originating creator. Although the feature is aimed at getting users to collaborate, it can also be seen as a way to discover more people to follow. The feature was first introduced for Instagram Stories last fall. The company says the sticker is a popular Stories feature, so it makes sense for Meta to bring it Reels as well, especially given its plans to double down on the short-form video feature. Since the sticker encourages users to post their own Reels in response to an original one, Meta could see it as a way to increase the number of Reels on its platforms, while also getting users who may not have otherwise posted Reels to share one. Meta also announced that it’s opening up Stars , the virtual items that allow fans to express their support for their favorite creators on Facebook Reels for all eligible creators. The company previously expanded Stars to Facebook Reels and is now rolling it out to all eligible creators. Meta also notes that it recently launched new mobile options for getting started with Stars and for tracking earnings. In addition, Meta now allows all users cross-post Reels from Instagram to Facebook easily. The company says this will allow creators to build communities on both social networks and participate in monetization programs offered by both Facebook and Instagram. Meta is also launching auto-created Facebook Reels, which are Reels compiled from your previously shared Facebook Stories. The new feature is designed to make it easier to share your favorite memories as Reels. Given Meta’s increased focus on Reels, it’s no surprise that the company is looking to encourage users to turn their Stories into Reels. Today’s feature drop also includes the addition of new Facebook Reels insights in Creator Studio. Meta says the new insights will help creators identify which Facebook Reels are is doing well. For instance, creators will get access to new metrics, such as Reach, Minutes Viewed and Average Watch Time. Lastly, Meta is launching new Reels Remix features for Facebook Reels, as you can now remix Facebook Reels sequentially. Along with the option to have your remix appear side-by-side at the same time as the original reel, the new option allows you to remix by showing your clip after the original reel. Meta has been betting big on Reels, and even recently announced that new video posts that are shorter than 15 minutes will now be shared as Reels on Instagram. The change is likely to upset some users, as it may pose some challenges. For example, it could be difficult to post a horizontal video if it gets uploaded into a vertical Reels format. However, the move wasn’t exactly unexpected, especially since Instagram has been hinting toward these plans for awhile. Last year, when Instagram head Adam Mosseri laid out Instagram’s priorities for 2022 , he said the company would double down on video and focus on Reels. It’s no surprise that Meta is doubling down on Reels, especially since Reels is a big potential moneymaker for the company in a time when its revenue is starting to decline . Zuckerberg recently noted that Meta has made more than a $1 billion annual run rate on Reels ads. He also shared that the amount of time users spent watching Reels has increased 30% since last quarter, but it’s possible that the cause of that increase is that we’re being served so many Reels by the algorithm. Instagram video posts shorter than 15 minutes will now be shared as Reels Topics Consumer News Reporter Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/09/faraday-lawsuit-fake-sales-whistleblowers-retaliation/,"Faraday Future faked early sales, lawsuits claim",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Two internal whistleblowers at Faraday Future claim the troubled EV company has been lying about some of the few sales it has announced to date. They also claim founder Jia Yueting has “weaponized” the EV startup’s HR department to retaliate against anyone who speaks up about these alleged misrepresentations. The employees, Jose Guerrero and Victoria Xie, have made those claims in a pair of newly filed lawsuits against Faraday Future and Jia — as well as the company’s head of HR, Nan Yang — in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleging wrongful termination, breach of contract, and infliction of emotional distress. Both lawsuits also highlight what has been the central tension of Faraday Future: that its founder, Jia, allegedly continues to assert control over the company despite having been sidelined in 2022 as the result of an internal probe . The previously unreported suits come as Faraday Future has continued to furlough and lay off employees to save what little cash it has left, to the point that it was nearly evicted from its Los Angeles headquarters after it missed multiple lease payments. This is all happening while the company is facing active investigations from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. “FF takes the allegations made in these two lawsuits by previous employees very seriously,” a spokesperson for Faraday Future said in an emailed statement. “FF believes on merit it has strong defenses to the alleged claims and will pursue all avenues and remedies available to protect and defend itself and the Company’s dedicated employees against all allegations including character attacks.” Jia, in an email to TechCrunch, said: “I believe that there are numerous false statements and defamatory allegations in the said complaints. I plan to file counter-lawsuits against the parties involved.” Guerrero and Xie, through counsel, declined to comment beyond the allegations in the filing. In an internal whistleblower letter submitted to the company’s general counsel on December 6, 2023, Guerrero and Xie claimed that Faraday Future lied about the first four publicly touted sales of its electric SUV, the FF91. Guerrero, who was a senior director of sales and aftersales at Faraday Future, and Xie, who was the company’s “go-to-market project manager and launch manager,” say that the company announced these deliveries before the sales process had been completed. They claim three of the four were never fully paid for, at least at the time the whistleblower letter was submitted, and the fourth was only paid for “more than 60 days after the ‘sale’ was announced.” Faraday Future has since claimed to have delivered 10 vehicles in all of 2023. Guerrero and Xie claim that when sales staff pushed back against these “premature” announcements, the leadership team in Jia’s department “continued to cite the need to announce sales to boost the Company’s share price and subjected staff who raised compliance concerns to retaliatory HR actions.” Guerrero and Xie go on to claim that Faraday Future executed these sales agreements with its initial customers without performing pre-delivery inspections on the vehicles, and that one of Jia’s lieutenants dismissed concerns about this. They say the sales team was pressured to submit DMV paperwork “without the required insurance and cash payments.” They also claim Jia’s team was sending “non-road approved software” to these early customer cars and that they were not properly documenting or disclosing the software’s release notes to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in potential violation of the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation Act. What’s more, they claim Faraday Future has been performing repairs on these early customer vehicles without proper documentation or work authorization, which he says could put the company’s license with the California Bureau of Automotive Repair at risk. “When [Defendant Mr. Jia] and his trusted circle inquired about regulatory requirements, it was done so with the clear intention to ‘creatively’ circumvent the rules,” they claim in the lawsuits. Xie says in her complaint that she was fired “in retaliation for her protected whistleblowing” just two days after the letter was submitted, and claims Jia and Yang were directly involved in her firing. Xie attempted to file an arbitration claim against the company on December 22, according to the complaint. But Faraday Future didn’t pay the required arbitration fees and missed the 30-day window to do so, thus making it possible for her to file a lawsuit in Superior Court, the complaint claims. Faraday Future allegedly fired Guerrero on January 18 in retaliation for speaking up, according to his complaint. He, too, filed an arbitration claim against the company, and when Faraday Future did not pay the fees, he was similarly free to file a lawsuit in Superior Court. Jia’s control over Faraday Future has always been a thorny issue. As previously reported, Jia secretly ran the company in its earliest years despite the company listing someone else as its CEO on paper. He did ultimately take over as CEO, but he brought in a former BMW executive to fill that role in 2019 in order to appeal to investors . The company ultimately went public in 2021 by merging with a special purpose acquisition company. Jia was reprimanded as the result of an internal probe that began in late 2021. That investigation looked into claims from a short-seller that Faraday Future had overstated the number of preorders for its vehicles, as well as a lack of proper disclosures around the founder’s movement of money in and out of the company. In 2022, people close to Jia helped lead a boardroom coup all while being investigated by the SEC and the DOJ. Jia is still not CEO, but Guerrero and Xie claim in their lawsuits that he “heads a shadow organization” that controls the company’s destiny. They say he and his trusted lieutenants meet at one of the mansions he purchased on the Pacific coastline nearly every week. “All major operational decisions within key functions of the businesses, including human resources, budget allocations, vehicle release, and the financial services, are directed and approved by Jia,” they claim in the lawsuits.

Tesla is back in the news cycle and our crystal ball says it’s one of those long-term affairs. The week kicked off with layoffs — about 10% of its more than 140,000-person workforce — and CEO Elon Musk declaring he was going “balls to the wall” on autonomy. It ended with a Cybertruck recall. Cool cool. There’s lots more in the newsletter than just Tesla — although before we move on, do check out Sean O’Kane’s scoop about the company’s 1,800-mile Tesla Semi charging corridor program. Read on to catch up on Serve Robotics’ public market debut, a week of highs and lows for Waymo , and more. Let’s go! While much of our focus is on startups and Silicon Valley, we do have some little birds in Washington, D.C. A little bird told us recently that federal regulators are getting close to publishing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on autonomous vehicle regulations, which would be the first set of federal guardrails proposed for the industry. Our source said the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), which regulates commercial vehicles in the U.S., should have a proposal out by this summer, fall at the latest. We’re told that the federal ruling on AVs will likely establish a minimum safety standard for AVs to operate on public roads but that state governments could enforce stricter regulations within their own borders. We’ve been hearing about discussions and plans around federal AV regulations for years now. Have we finally started to make headway? We shall see. Got a tip for us?

Serve Robotics , the Nvidia- and Uber-backed sidewalk robot delivery company, hit the public markets this week via a reverse merger. Serve expects its public debut to bring in around $40 million in gross proceeds, funding that will go toward R&D for future robots, manufacturing of new robots, geographic expansion and more. Serve’s goal is to increase its fleet from the 100 robots deployed today around Los Angeles to 2,000 robots across multiple U.S. cities by the end of 2025, via a partnership with Uber Eats. Serve has huge revenue ambitions, with plans to generate between $60 million and $80 million in annual revenue by that same deadline. In 2023, Serve brought in $207,545 in revenue at a loss of $1.5 million. FWIW, Uber and Nvidia are still shareholders, but their shares in the company are decreasing with this debut. Pre-IPO, Uber and Nvidia held a 16.6% stake and 14.3% stake, respectively. Once the offering closes, those stakes will change to 11.5% and 10.1%, per regulatory filings Serve’s share price was $4 at market open on Thursday, and it closed that day at around $3. Other deals that got my attention … Found Energy , a startup that uses waste aluminum to generate heat and hydrogen, raised a $12 million seed round, but Tim De Chant’s story on the company is about so much more. Getir , a Turkish delivery company that was once worth $12 billion, is reportedly weighing asset sales and exits from non-core markets as investors put the pressure on to cut losses. Swtch Energy , a company building EV charging solutions for apartment buildings, raised $27.2 million in a Series B to expand its charging network and boost the tech behind its charging and energy management solutions. Blue Earth Capital led the round with participation from Alantra’s Energy Transition Fund Klima, Active Impact Investments and GIGA Investments Corp. Mobileye has secured orders to ship 46 million of its EyeQ6 Light ADAS chips over the next few years to automakers. Multiple models launching this year will feature the chip, which promises to deliver improved sensing of wet roads, detection of and reaction to objects at a greater distance, and better ability to read key text phrases on road signs. TechCrunch had the chance to dig into this, and our main takeaways are that automakers will probably love this chip because it’s more powerful than Mobileye’s last chip, but it’s the same price. has begun initial data collection and mapping in Atlanta , the company’s latest geographic win. The Alphabet-owned company didn’t say whether it plans to launch in the Georgian city or any other city it is mapping in, such as Washington, D.C., and Buffalo. Aside from San Francisco, Waymo has launched commercial robotaxi services in Los Angeles and Phoenix, with Austin planned for the end of this year. But with ups, come downs. Six Waymo vehicles also got caught blocking traffic to an on-ramp in San Francisco. The vehicles were caught between a construction zone and the on-ramp and had to pull over to await rescue. A spokesperson told TechCrunch that while Waymo does have the green light to go fully driverless on freeways in San Francisco, the company has not yet pulled the driver out. General Motors launched a home EV charger and vehicle-to-home (V2H) kit that lets a home pull energy from an EV battery in the event of a blackout. Customers in California, Florida, Texas, Michigan and New York can purchase today. Gogoro , the two-wheeler battery-swapping company, and TSMC , a global semiconductor company, are partnering to introduce 15 GoStations across Taiwan that use 100% clean energy. They’ll also be launching Gogoro’s scooter-sharing service in TSMC’s headquarter city, Hsinchu, and expanding the charging network in the city. We’ve been all over this week, so let’s dive in. The week started out with company-wide layoffs that affected at least 10% of the entire 140,000-person organization, with some teams seeing 20% of their staff gutted. Two high-profile executives departed Tesla as well: Drew Baglino, Tesla’s SVP of Powertrain and Energy, and Rohan Patel, VP of Public Policy and Business Development. Patel told TechCrunch he left because of “[b]ig overall changes” at the company that he declined to specify. In an email sent to the company, CEO Elon Musk said the cuts were necessary to increase productivity and prepare for Tesla’s “next phase of growth.” (Psssst! Don’t want to read about Tesla layoffs and what comes next? You can watch about it instead .) Many of those who were cut, sources say, were high performers who just happened to be working on lower-priority projects. Sources at Tesla also told TechCrunch the company made the cuts because it expects poor first-quarter earnings. Deliveries were subpar, and all those price cuts last year that continued early into 2024 likely had an effect on Tesla’s margins. Deliveries were down in Q1 year-over-year, despite the $200,000 Tesla spent on advertising on X, per our reporting Which might be why Tesla ditched its EV inventory price discounts this week. On X, Musk said this move was in line with Tesla’s strategy to “streamline the whole Tesla sales and delivery system.” These changes in general, and the layoffs in particular, are made more stark by Tesla’s proxy statement that calls on the board to reinstate Musk’s $56 billion payout, which a Delaware judge earlier this year voided. In a huff, Musk threatened to reincorporate Tesla in Texas instead, and it appears that plan will also be put to the board soon. Meanwhile, on the charging front, Tesla is moving forward with its plan to build an electric big rig charging corridor stretching from Texas to California, despite being snubbed by a lucrative federal funding program that’s part of Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure law. Tesla this week also had to recall the 3,878 Cybertrucks that it has delivered to customers to date over faulty accelerator pedals that can get stuck. I know what you’re thinking. Finally we know how many Cybertrucks Tesla delivered. I’ve been in a handful of new vehicles and I’m eager to share my thoughts, but we’re also running out of space this week. In the coming issues, we’ll have some takes on electric bikes, the 2024 Lexus LC 500h , the 2024 Mercedes-Benz eSprinter and more. See y’all next week!

https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/14/morpheus-spaces-satellite-thrusters-are-propelled-forward-with-a-28m-series-a/,Morpheus Space’s satellite thrusters are propelled forward with a $28M Series A,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The booming satellite industry has been a boon for Morpheus Space , which produces a modular, electric propulsion system for small satellites. Morpheus has raised a $28 million Series A , with which it intends to build a factory in Dresden, Germany, where it’s based, and to increase headcount. That will allow the company to ramp up production of its propulsion systems to meet exponentially growing demand in the smallsat market; since 2019, the number of small satellite launches has increased by nearly 450%. In 2020, Morpheus launched its Nano Field Effect Electric Propulsion (NanoFEEP) thruster, which it claims is the “smallest and most efficient electric in-space propulsion system” in the world. Because the system is modular, NanoFEEP thrusters can be combined to create more powerful propulsion systems to meet the needs of a specific satellite. For instance, a cluster of seven NanoFEEP thrusters is called a MultiFEEP, and multiple MultiFEEP thrusters can be added in order to maneuver larger craft. This allows clients to avoid spending additional time and resources developing customized propulsion systems for each of its satellites. Since the launch of NanoFEEP, Morpheus has landed clients like Spire Global, Antaris Space and Rocket Factory Augsburg — with plenty more on the way. “In the last year, our number of contracts has increased by 250% and is on pace to grow more,” said István Lőrincz, president of Morpheus, who also spoke on the topic at last year’s TC Sessions: Space . “The new factory will help us meet the needs of our growing user base. We are going to show by example that the NewSpace industry needs to implement scalable business and production solutions as fast as possible to meet the expected projections.” Morpheus has already indicated its nimbleness in two short years. “One major improvement we implemented recently in our hardware came in the form of a new propellant that has improved the performance of our propulsion systems. It is non-toxic and non-corrosive with zero transport or handling restrictions,” said Lőrincz, noting that the former fuel used gallium. The company has also developed the Sphere ecosystem, an all-in-one package that Morpheus claims differentiates it from its competitors. “We provide a platform-agnostic AI for their satellite navigation, an application that helps plan the entire customer journey from design to satellite operations, mission design software for constellations, and our world-class propulsion devices,” said Lőrincz. The funding round was led by Alpine Space Ventures, with participation from Vsquared Ventures, Lavrock Ventures, Airbus Ventures, In-Q-Tel, Pallas Ventures and Techstars Ventures. With thousands of satellites due to launch over the next few years, Morpheus has plenty more potential clients (and investors) to woo with its system.

Use this link to receive 15% off passes (excluding online and expo). NASA has finalized an agreement with SpaceX to purchase five more astronaut transportation missions to and from the International Space Station, further entrenching the space company’s position as the prime services vendor for the space agency. The new contract — for the Crew-10, Crew-11, Crew-12, Crew-13 and Crew-14 missions — is valued at $1.4 billion. It brings the total contract value for all 14 transportation missions, part of the Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) program, to $4.9 billion. The funds include use of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule to transport up to four astronauts, the Falcon 9 rocket for launch and all other return and recovery operations. NASA announced its intention to order the additional missions in June. Just one month after SpaceX announced its Starlink Maritime service, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines said it will add the service to its entire cruise fleet. It’s no surprise: The test deployment “received tremendous positive feedback,” the cruise line said in a statement. The coverage will likely be better than what currently exists on cruise ships today. The service is costing around $5,000 per month, not including a $10,000 hardware fee paid upfront.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/12/blue-origin-launch-aborted-after-mid-flight-anomaly/,Blue Origin launch aborted after mid-flight anomaly,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Blue Origin launched its 23rd New Shepard rocket mission this morning, featuring science payloads designed for experimentation. The mission needed early, however, after it was aborted during the first ascent stage of the rocket, prompting the abort process to take over and firing the parachutes on the capsule, which drifted back to Earth shortly after take-off. This was not a crewed mission, so there was no one on board the capsule, though it is the same vehicle that the company uses for its private spaceflight tourist missions. This marks the first time ever that Blue Origin has encountered a problem with the New Shepard spacecraft during a flight, in nearly two dozen missions. So far, all Blue Origin has said is that an anomaly was detected which resulted in the abort process. The company hasn’t yet specified any details, but the issue occurred during the ‘Max Q’ phase of the launch, which is the point at which the rocket is undergoing the most stress due to atmospheric pressure and friction. We’ll be looking for updates (Blue Origin says they’re on the way), but the mission does provide a unique test of Blue Origin’s active escape system, which was responsible for the capsule separating and landing apparently safely once the anomaly occurred. Update: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration will oversee the investigation into the anomaly, the agency said in a statement just hours after the mishap occurred. Blue Origin will not be prohibited from flying New Shepard until the investigation is concluded. Blue Origin in a separate statement released a few more details about today’s anomaly, noting that while the capsule escape system successfully fulfilled its function, the booster from which it separated hit the ground. The company added that “all personnel have been accounted for” and there are no reported injuries.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/27/ftc-is-suing-meta-to-block-acquisition-of-vr-fitness-app/,FTC sues Meta to block acquisition of VR fitness app,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The FTC filed an injunction today to block Meta’s acquisition of the virtual reality studio Within, which is best known more recently for its subscription VR workout app Supernatural. The regulatory body has had plenty of skirmishes with Facebook, now Meta, in recent years, but this is a pretty aggressive signal from the agency that they’re going to make M&A hell for Meta going forward. “Meta could have chosen to try to compete,” the FTC said in its lawsuit. “instead, Meta decided it preferred to simply buy” the startup; “[t] hat lessening of rivalry may yield multiple harmful outcomes, including less innovation, lower quality, higher prices, less incentive to attract and keep employees, and less consumer choice.” This lawsuit comes at an inopportune time for the company, which is struggling to balance its grand ambitions for the VR sector with runaway R&D spending on the category, which is negatively affecting its bottom line and its stock price. This week, Meta made the largely unprecedented move to substantially raise prices on its Quest 2 headset deep into the device’s lifespan. Meta is raising the price of Quest 2 virtual reality headsets by $100 A price for the Within deal was never announced, though a report from The Information pinned the deal at $400 million. Within raised over $52 million in venture funding from investors like a16z, according to Crunchbase . This saga largely looks like the FTC looking to chase its own demons for okaying the Instagram acquisition way back when and further signaling to Meta that they’re going to have to grow on the merits of their own internal operations and can’t rely on startup acquisitions in adjacent categories going forward. Some of the FTC’s comments do raise fundamental questions about why a company acquires a different company to begin with other than to create a shortcut to success in a business category. Meta has acquired a number of popular VR apps and game studios over the years, though the Within deal appears to be one of its more significant bets. “The FTC’s case is based on ideology and speculation, not evidence. The idea that this acquisition would lead to anticompetitive outcomes in a dynamic space with as much entry and growth as online and connected fitness is simply not credible. By attacking this deal in a 3-2 vote, the FTC is sending a chilling message to anyone who wishes to innovate in VR. We are confident that our acquisition of Within will be good for people, developers and the VR space,” a Meta spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement to TechCrunch. This is totally unnecessary. VR is brand new, and there’s really few other buyers for tech like this right now. https://t.co/EOdNl4eAI9 — Aaron Levie 🇺🇸 (@levie) July 27, 2022 Topics Lucas Matney was a senior editor at TechCrunch based in San Francisco.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/03/vc-firm-maniv-is-growing-in-every-direction-armed-with-a-140m-new-fund/,"VC firm Maniv is growing in every direction, armed with a $140M new fund",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Venture firm Maniv has grown by nearly every measure since it launched eight years ago in Israel — from its investor base and 40-startup portfolio to its geographic focus, footprint and fund size. But even with a freshly closed $140 million fund in its coffers and a new office in New York City, founder Michael Granoff says Maniv is still just a seed-stage fund at heart “that occasionally breaks its own rules.” What that means is largely the same as when it launched in 2016: an early-stage investment strategy focused on what the firm describes as the intersection between mobility, transportation and energy. There are, however, some notable evolutions that hint at Maniv’s investment strategy with its third and latest fund known as Maniv III, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. Maniv, once firmly focused on Israeli startups, continues to expand its geographic focus and now has active portfolio companies in nine countries. “So we will certainly keep our eyes on the local market here but we’ll go for the best deals and learn everything we can from the deal flow that comes in a very distributed way from around the world,” Granoff said. The VC firm has also largely stopped using the once trendy umbrella term “mobility,” (often leaving it out of its original name Maniv Mobility) and has opted instead to talk about deep tech, decarbonization and digitization of the transportation sector. “I thought the trajectory of that term (mobility) was going to continue to clarify overtime, but in fact, I think the opposite has happened for a bunch of reasons,” Granoff explained, adding that while the term mobility might not be used as often, it is still very much central to its mission. Nate Jaret, general partner at Maniv, said the $140 million fund does reflect new goals: a more diverse group of investors as well as the inclusion of financial investors who see the decarbonization and digitization of all forms of transportation (even the air and sea) as an irreversible secular trend that generates the best financial returns. Historically, Maniv’s investor base has been loaded with automakers. It now better reflects the critical and myriad tributaries in transportation and mobility, Jaret says. In other words, Maniv went outside traditional automotive to find strategic investors in leasing, fintech, logistics, vehicle maintenance, energy, fleet management and repair. Its newest investors in the fund, a group that includes BNP Paribas Personal Finance and the venture arms of Shell and Enterprise Mobility, represent “the rich tapestry of industries that are directly impacted by the changes in transportation across these themes of decarbonization and digitization,” Jaret said. “It’s not just carmakers and Tier 1s that make the platforms but also aftermarket insurance, maintenance repair, infrastructure players and energy players that are trying to understand their new position.” The Maniv III fund also includes return investors Valeo and Jaguar Land Rover venture arm InMotion Ventures. Toyota Motor Corp.’s Woven Capital, vehicle leasing company Arval, transportation infrastructure giant Ferrovial, the industrial manufacturing firm ITT Inc., fleet payments business WEX and an unnamed European insurance company also participated in the fund. Maniv’s fund also reflects an evolving investment strategy. The firm, which has nearly $320 million in assets under management, previously led investments in AI edge computation chip startup Hailo in Tel Aviv; EV ridehail and charging network Revel in New York City; medium-duty EV truck maker Harbinger Motors in California; intercity busing platform Kolors in Mexico City; two-wheeler EV startup River from India; and Spanish car subscription Bipi, which was acquired by Renault’s financing arm RCI Banque in 2021. Maniv is now creeping into the broader climate tech world — at least where it overlaps with transportation. The firm has used the new fund to make four investments to date, including in a Chicago-based startup called Celadyne, which is working to extend the lifespan and efficiency of proton-exchange membranes to make green hydrogen production financially viable. The fund has also invested in Israeli startup Neologic, which has developed a proprietary chip design for performance and power gains in data centers and automotive; an e-motorcycle battery-swapping startup called Vammo that’s based in Brazil; and San Francisco-based Circular, which is pushing the use of post-consumer recycled plastic in manufacturing by closing pervasive information and testing gaps.

Fisker revealed in a Monday morning regulatory filing that the automaker terminated the negotiations March 22. It did not explain why. But the company had to keep the negotiations going as part of one of the closing conditions for a potential $150 million convertible note announced last week . Fisker said in the filing that it will ask the unnamed investor to waive the closing condition. The startup’s stock plunged 28% after the stock market opened, and trading was halted. It’s the latest in a series of ominous signs for the imperiled EV startup. Fisker has struggled to sell its Ocean SUV in the early going, underperforming its own internal sales goals, as TechCrunch reported in January , and forcing a pivot away from a direct sales model. Some of the cars that have been delivered have been affected by a number of quality problems — ones that Fisker has, at times, struggled to solve, according to internal documents . In February, Fisker laid off 15% of its staff (around 200 people) and last week reported having just $121 million in the bank. The company has paused production and warned investors it would not survive a year without a fresh infusion of cash. Fisker held talks with other automakers, including Mazda , but only Nissan recently remained at the table. Fisker said Monday morning that it is evaluating other “strategic alternatives” to the potential tie-up with Nissan, including “in or out of court restructurings, capital markets transactions (subject to market conditions), repurchases, redemptions, exchanges or other refinancings of its existing debt, the potential issuance of equity securities, the potential sale of assets and businesses and/or other strategic transactions and/or other measures.” Topics Sr. Reporter, Transportation LIMITED TIME: Save $300+ on your ticket, plus an additional 50% on a second for a full immersive day of AI!

Welcome back to TechCrunch Mobility — your central hub for news and insights on the future of transportation. Remember in the last edition of TechCrunch Mobility, when I wrote that the wheels were starting to come off the Fisker bus? Sheesh. Did they. To catch you up: Fisker issued a warning on March 18 that it was pausing production for six weeks and had just $121 million in cash and cash equivalents, $32 million of which was restricted or not immediately accessible. The company was counting on a $150 million influx of capital via convertible notes and a potential partnership with another automaker. Those hopes incinerated as fast as a gasoline-soaked rag when negotiations between Fisker and the large automaker — reported to be Nissan — fell apart and put that convertible note deal in jeopardy. Shares plummeted 28%, trading was halted, and in a final blow, the New York Stock Exchange said it was taking steps to remove Fisker from the exchange . Those are all symptoms of a bigger problem within the company, including one particularly embarrassing one that TC reporter Sean O’Kane uncovered. The tl;dr: Fisker temporarily lost track of millions of dollars in customer payments as it scaled up deliveries, leading to an internal audit that started in December and took months to complete. Alrighty, let’s jump into the rest of it, including where bankrupt EV startup Arrival’s assets ended up, a profile on startup Ionobell hoping to increase EV range through recycled silicon battery materials, and a $1 billion boost for Lucid Founders, investors, engineers, policy wonks and others tell us things.

Amid all of the EV startup bankruptcies and other bleak goings-on, there was a bit of positive news. , which has had its own struggles, raised another $1 billion from its biggest financial backer, Saudi Arabia. Ayar Third Investment , an affiliate of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, agreed to buy $1 billion worth of Lucid’s stock, which will add to the Kingdom’s current stake of around 60% ownership. The $1 billion boost is a lot of money, but it doesn’t last long if you’re trying to design, manufacture, sell and service vehicles. This gives Lucid an important capital buffer; however, it does not end it’s existential crisis. The company must successfully bring its next vehicle, the Gravity SUV, to market and drum up fresh business for its existing Air sedan if it hopes to survive and scale. Other deals that got my attention … Cyvl.ai , a Boston-area startup that helps municipalities and civil engineering firms track the conditions of transportation infrastructure, raised $6 million in a round led by Companyon Ventures with participation from Argon Ventures, Aero X Ventures and Alumni Ventures. Existing investors MassVentures, Launch Capital and RiverPark Ventures also participated. Ember , a Scottish startup building one of the U.K.’s first all-electric intercity bus networks, raised $14 million in a Series A round led by Inven Capital. Investors 2150 and AENU also participated. , a seed-stage startup that says its silicon material will be cheaper than the established competition and help boost range in EV batteries, closed an unpriced $3.9 million seed extension , TechCrunch exclusively learned. Dynamo Ventures and Trucks VC led the round. Iron Sheepdog , a startup that developed trucking software for brokers and contractors, raised $10 million in a Series B round led by SJF Ventures with participation from Grand Ventures, Supply Chain Ventures, and other strategic partners in the construction industry. Tesla is going to give every customer in the U.S. a free one-month trial of its $12,000 Full Self-Driving Beta driver-assistance system , provided they have a car with the compatible hardware. The company is also reportedly mandating, at CEO Elon Musk’s request, that prospective buyers are given a demo of the software before they purchase a new Tesla. It seems that Tesla is turning to FSD as another financial lever to pull as profits on automotive sales shrink. Arrival sold some of its assets , including advanced manufacturing equipment, to Canoo , another struggling startup trying to build and sell electric vehicles. You can’t make this stuff up, folks! The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced new emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles sold in the U.S. from 2027 to 2032, a regulation that will increasingly limit the amount of pollution emitted by new heavy trucks. The regulations technically don’t mandate that these non-polluting heavy trucks are electric and instead let manufacturers decide how to meet the standards, whether its through hydrogen-powered fuel cells, better fuel efficiency or another alternative fuel. However, many believe it will mean a boost in battery-electric heavy-duty trucks. Consider the potential effect for this rule: The heavy-trucks category applies to more than 100 vehicle types, including vocational vehicles such as delivery trucks, garbage haulers, public utility trucks, transit, shuttle and school buses, as well as tractor-trailer trucks. GM has lost another executive who was part of the company’s software and digital services effort. You might recall that former Apple executive Mike Abbott, who was executive vice president of GM’s software and services, stepped down earlier this month due to health issues. Now Edward Kummer, a former president of Nordstrom Rack’s online business who joined GM in 2021 to head up its new digital business team, is gone, the Detroit News reported I rarely test out internal combustion engine vehicles, but I made an exception this week when I had the chance to spend a few hundred miles behind the wheel of a 2024 Land Rover Defender 110 X-Dynamic SE . And technically, folks, this has a six-cylinder Mild-Hybrid Electric Vehicle powertrain, so that still qualifies, right? My experience with Land Rover Defender has been solely in body-on-frame models that are decades old. So I was looking forward to finally getting in the modern version, which Land Rover officially brought back in 2020. The spec I drove, which was priced at just under $88,000 and included some pricey upgrades and 22-inch wheels, is probably suited for the well-heeled urban customer. But with different tires, this aluminum monocoque-structure Defender could absolutely handle off-road conditions. I played around on dirt roads — no rock crawling — and it handled just fine with no squeaks, rattles or clunks, even on washboard terrain. I didn’t love the advanced driver-assistance system, notably how the driver engages the adaptive cruise control. But there were lots of features I did like, including the very quiet ride, adaptive air suspension, the white paint-on-black gloss details, a functional rear door and easy-to-reach spare tire, the air-chilled cubby to keep snacks cool and an interior design that marries utilitarian function with robust, high-quality materials. A final word on that interior — you won’t find a massive screen here. But there are tech-related details mixed in with the buttons and knobs. My version had a wireless charger and plenty of charger ports, including one on the dash of the passenger side. And the user interface was actually fairly decent. One feature I liked was a drop-down menu on the media toggle that allowed me to quickly swap between Apple CarPlay and the native infotainment system that included Sirius XM radio or local stations. That might seem inconsequential, but I have been in a number of EVs lately that make it far too complicated to switch between CarPlay and the native system.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/09/muon-space-plans-a-turnkey-solution-for-custom-earth-observation-satellites/,Muon Space plans a ‘turnkey solution’ for custom Earth observation satellites,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Plenty of companies want to operate in space, but few have or need the expertise to do so. They want an eye in the sky but not a satellite company. Muon Space is one of several startups looking to put others into space but with a special expertise in Earth observation and building the full stack from satellite bus to data on the ground. It has already raised $25 million to do so and locked down a few early big customers. “People are reinventing large portions of the stack required to collect data from space,” Muon’s CEO and co-founder Jonny Dyer explained. “When we look across the spectrum of different new phenomenologies and missions, many of these companies are developing their own spacecraft, and obviously their own ground segments and data, so they can address a particular vertical market. We think that doesn’t make sense.” To invent an example, consider a solar farm builder. They want to use satellite imagery to monitor their work and provide a data point on the resilience of their installations over time, looking for things like hot spots, broken panels and so on. They basically have two options. One is to use imagery from existing private satellites like Planet’s, which may or may not collect the type of data they want, at the frequency they want. The other is to build their own satellite and pay to put it in orbit — probably a nine-figure endeavor. Muon is looking to provide a third option: a specialty space data partner that helps a company build an Earth observation platform from soup to nuts. That means designing the sensors, the bus, the navigation and telemetry systems, and the downlink and ground infrastructure needed to support this data-heavy industry. Of course this won’t be cheap either, but it’s cheaper than building a satellite division yourself, and you’d be working with a crew that’s already made and launched several satellites and has made a specialty of Earth observation. Dyer was a principal engineer at Google Geo, and chief engineer at Skybox, and the rest of the crew has been built around remote sensing as well. “Our team is somewhat unique in the depth and breadth of our expertise in these systems,” Dyer said, “but also the data utilization component — what’s needed to make these things valuable.” Among Muon’s early customers are Google, the Environmental Defense Fund and another undisclosed partner, all of which it must be said will probably make good use of the company’s first three spacecraft, which use a different method of imaging the Earth than you might expect: microwaves. “It’s a class of observation we call signals of opportunity ,” said Dan McCleese, Muon’s chief scientist and formerly of the same role at JPL. The sensors they’ve built capture reflected radio waves in the microwave spectrum that have been emitted by other spacecraft, meaning they don’t have to send any out themselves. “You can think of it as a form of radar. It’s a key measurement used by NOAA and NASA for weather prediction — there’s been a lot of technological development in reducing the size and cost of these sensors, but they need to get lots of them in the air to reduce the temporal resolution,” said Dyer — meaning reducing the time between observations of a given location. In this case the microwave land monitoring method would be useful for monitoring wildfires — everyone wants to know where they are in real time, but the gear in orbit right now simply can’t provide that information. Muon provided a simulation of how its satellites (top right) would be able to visualize a spreading fire compared with what’s up there (bottom row), which you can see below: This is just one of the many remote sensing opportunities out there relating to climate change and environmental monitoring and modeling, markets Muon is hoping to target first. Notably, the spectrum that its first satellites monitor can be adjusted via software, much the way radios can be tuned that way — it can’t suddenly become an infrared detector, though it can change its mission to support other bands of interest. But beyond the passive microwave radar, Muon is hoping to take advantage of other technologies that have been pioneered but not yet deployed widely. “We also have longer-term interest in other parts of the spectrum,” said Dyer. “Multispectral, hyperspectral, infrared … and there are optical architectures that allow a similar approach to collecting very broad bandwidths and then selecting what you need.” Their plans include using instruments developed by agencies like NASA that have no active mission. Pixxel takes orbital imagery hyperspectral with $25M A round “It’s interesting,” put in McCleese, “NASA is putting a lot of effort into coming up with the means and technology of doing smallsats, but they’re largely in the field of demonstrations. There is an enormously rich area of demonstrated instruments by NASA, JAXA, etc. that are not being picked up for continuing observation. The demonstration was the focus, then the project comes to an end.” A bunch of cutting-edge Earth observation tech sitting on a shelf just waiting for a tech transfer application is certainly a good place to start. Dyer said they will combine this with the company’s own accumulated expertise in the area and advances to “start from first principles in the ecosystem.” “We want to provide a turnkey solution to formulate a set of sensors to address their problem, and go with them to full deployment of operations and data to meet their business needs. In many ways we think of the question of deploying sensors in space inside out,” he said, designing the satellite and data handling around the use case rather than vice versa. The $25 million A round was led by Radical Ventures, with participation from Costanoa Ventures, Congruent Ventures, Space Capital and Ubiquity Ventures. “It definitely gets us to space, easily through the first three spacecraft, and it gets us to an MVP level on the support structure for those missions,” said Dyer. That brings the total raised by the company to $35 million. Expect Muon’s first spacecraft to go up starting in May of next year on a SpaceX Falcon 9 ride-share mission if all continues to go well for them.

Sure enough, today Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines announced it will be adding the service to its whole fleet, after a pilot service on one of its ships got rave reviews. It should come as no surprise that commercial marine endeavors like this one are embracing Starlink. The test deployment aboard the Freedom of the Seas “received tremendous positive feedback,” and if you’ve ever been on one of these boats, you can probably guess why. Current satellite at sea options aren’t great: expensive and slow, having enjoyed a market with little competition or innovation for the last couple decades. Starlink Maritime will be a real kick in the pants for existing providers, considering how quickly a huge customer like Royal Caribbean decided to buy in to the new satellite on the block. Even though its coverage is limited to coastal waters for now, the speed is way better and will probably pay for itself with onboard “premium Wi-Fi” charges in the first month. The service costs the company roughly $5,000 monthly and has at least a $10,000 upfront hardware fee for the special terminals you’ll need to use it. That’s a rounding error in the rolling costs of running vessels as large as modern cruise ships. (An image provided by Celebrity Cruises suggests additional dishes will be used — I’ve asked for more information.) Although the Starlink constellation doesn’t yet work mid-ocean (such as on container ships), the plan is to provide that capability in the northern hemisphere by the end of the year and the southern hemisphere in early 2023. Central and South America, all of Indonesia and Malaysia, and the southern half of Africa aren’t on the coverage map, though, which feels like leaving money on the table. The dishes will be added to all vessels in the Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises fleets, in case you’re planning a trip. No specific dates yet, but the company says they should have the service on all ships by the end of Q1 2023.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/13/meta-hands-free-features-ray-ban-stories-whatsapp/,Meta’s Ray-Ban Stories now let users make calls and send messages with WhatsApp,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced today that the company is launching more hands-free features for its Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses. Starting today, Ray-Ban Stories users can make calls, hear message readouts and send end-to-end encrypted messages with WhatsApp. Meta added similar functionality for Facebook Messenger last year. Zuckerberg also announced that users will soon be able to directly reply to Messenger or WhatsApp messages with voice commands. With this new update, users can make calls and send messages on WhatsApp hands-free by saying “Hey Facebook, send a message to…” or “Hey Facebook, call…” You can also listen to new messages you receive on WhatsApp. Once you get a new message, the glasses will say: “New message on WhatsApp from <name>: Is now a good time to talk?” In a future update, Meta plans to add the ability to directly reply to incoming messages on Messenger and WhatsApp, hands-free by saying: “Hey Facebook, reply” after the glasses read out a new message. The company notes that your personal messages and calls are automatically secured with end-to-end encryption, which means WhatsApp, Meta and third parties can’t read or listen to them. After the voice assistant identifies a voice command related to WhatsApp calling or messaging, the voice transcript and audio is not stored on any server. Meta also say it plans to expand WhatsApp and Messenger support for French and Italian speaking Ray-Ban Stories users this year. Today’s update is rolling out to both the Facebook View iOS and Android app in phases and will be available to everyone in the coming days. Meta says users should make sure they have the latest app update and firmware on their glasses. debuted its Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses in September 2021 in partnership with eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica. The glasses allow users to snap photos and videos with the two onboard 5 MP cameras, listen to music with in-frame speakers and take phone calls. The glasses need to be connected to an iOS or Android device for full functionality, though users can take and store hundreds of photos or dozens of videos on the glasses before transferring media to their phones via Facebook’s new View app. The twin cameras allow users to add 3D effects to their photos and videos once they upload them to the app. The smart sunglasses come in three classic Ray-Ban styles, with a number of color and lens combinations. The Ray-Ban Stories are fully compatible with prescription lenses. The glasses start at $299, with polarized and transition lens options available at a higher price point. At the time of the launch, Meta indicated that the device was a stepping stone for its AR ambitions and an effort to get users acquainted with the idea of high-tech glasses. The launch of the new features comes as Meta is said to be scaling back its plans for its AR glasses, according to a recent report from The Information . The company reportedly had originally planned to launch the first version of its AR glasses, which are codenamed Project Nazare, in 2024. However, employees have been notified that Meta no longer plans to commercially release the AR glasses due to efforts to cut back on heavy investments in its Reality Labs and AR/VR division. The company plans to instead use the first version of the AR glasses as a demonstration product, as opposed to a commercial one. Meta is now planning to prioritize the release of the second version of the AR glasses, codenamed Artemis.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/15/india-cuts-import-taxes-on-evs-in-win-for-tesla-entry-plans/,India cuts import taxes on EVs in win for Tesla’s entry plans,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us India will lower import taxes on certain electric vehicles for companies committing to invest at least $500 million and setting up a local manufacturing facility within three years, a policy shift that could potentially bolster Tesla’s plans to enter the South Asian market. Companies must invest a minimum of $500 million in the country and will have three years to establish local manufacturing for EVs with at least 25% of components sourced domestically, according to a government press release on Friday. Firms meeting these requirements will be allowed to import 8,000 EVs a year at a reduced import duty of 15% on cars costing $35,000 and above. India currently levies a tax of 70% to 100% on imported cars depending on their value. The policy change is likely going to pave the way for Tesla to enter India, as the Elon Musk-led company has been in talks with the government to lower import duties on its electric cars for years. The move also aligns with India’s goal to boost the adoption of EVs and reduce its dependence on oil imports, with the country setting a target of achieving 30% electric car sales by 2030. The new policy “will provide Indian consumers with access to latest technology, boost the Make in India initiative, strengthen the EV ecosystem by promoting healthy competition among EV players leading to high volume of production, economies of scale, lower cost of production, reduce imports of crude oil, lower trade deficit, reduce air pollution, particularly in cities, and will have a positive impact on health and environment,” the Ministry of Heavy Industries said in a statement. India’s Commerce and Industry Ministry said separately the firms that invest at least $800 million in the country will be allowed to import up to 40,000 EVs, with a maximum of 8,000 units per year. Tesla has been looking to enter India for several years. The carmaker initially wanted to establish a local footprint in 2021. Musk later resisted the India launch plan until New Delhi allowed the company to sell and service imported cars in the country. Tesla is expected to enter India by importing its EVs from China’s Shanghai, though it would move its manufacturing and battery plant over the next couple of years, BofA analysts wrote in a note late last year. The company is also estimated to launch a sub-$25,000 model — more affordable than its cheapest model in China (where Tesla sells cars priced between $32,000-33,000) — to cater to its Indian customers and take on incumbents, including Tata Motors and Hyundai. “Net net, Tesla would be relevant for top 20-25% of PV mkt initially & assuming 30-40% EV shift here plus dominant share would yield 100-200K vols. Hence, it will likely still be long road for Tesla to garner scale volumes at this price point in India for its planned capacity of 500K pa,” the BofA analysts wrote. Unlike the U.S. and other major automobile markets, India’s average car price is less than $10,000, and 70% of the cars sold in the country are below $15,000. Therefore, Tesla may use India as a manufacturing base to export its vehicles to Southeast Asia, the analysts estimated. In September, India’s Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said Tesla targeted to almost double its automobile component sourcing from India to $1.7-$1.9 billion in 2023 from $1 billion in 2022. Alongside Tesla, Vietnam’s electric carmaker VinFast sees India as its new manufacturing hub. Earlier this year, VinFast, which is currently struggling in the U.S. and Canada, announced its plans to invest $2 billion in the country, with $500 million specifically to set up a 400-acre integrated facility in the Southern state of Tamil Nadu. Lotus Cars, the sports car maker owned by China’s Geely, also entered India last year by partnering with a local importer and launching its electric SUV Eletre. Even though the Indian government intends to attract foreign EV players by introducing friendlier import tax policy, the country is primarily a two-wheeler-driven market. It also has local carmakers Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra that often attempt to resist global players from expanding in the country.

The rooftop tent, which Rivian calls the treehouse, is equipped with a movie projector, which is run using power from the Rivian, Brian Gase, Rivian’s senior director of prototype and special projects, told TechCrunch during a customer event in Laguna Beach, California. The customer event was held Thursday evening, several hours after Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe unveiled the all-electric R2 SUV and the sporty R3 and R3x hatchback vehicles . The treehouse, as Rivian has branded it, is different from the white-labeled Yakima tent designed for its flagship R1T truck. This new treehouse product is contained in a hardshell, which then opens up into a large rooftop tent. Opposite the opening is a large window, where the roll-down screen is located, Gase said. The projector can be connected to a power source from the vehicle, he added. The treehouse also comes with an interior fan and lighting. Gase said the treehouse design will largely remain the same once it goes on sale. Right now, he said, the focus is about keeping the quality high without making it too expensive. “It’s about the cost because you can look at it and say ‘that’s awesome,’ but then you’re putting an expensive tent on a product that you’re trying to get to an introductory level price,” Gase said, referring to the R2, which is expected to have a starting price of $45,000. The treehouse-that-turns-into-a-movie-theater is just one of several adventure-minded accessories revealed Thursday alongside Rivian’s next-generation of smaller more affordable EVs. Rivian plans to sell a cargo box that mounts to a hitch on the back of the vehicle and that can be paired with a new travel kitchen. The kitchen includes a water tank, cooler and cookware set. On Thursday, Rivian revealed the R2, a five-seat, all-electric midsized SUV that will have more than 300 miles of range and a base price of $45,000. In a surprise twist, Scaringe also unveiled the smaller R3 and the R3x performance, a compact hatchback-style EV with sporty vibes. Rivian hasn’t given a production timeline for the R3 vehicles. The R2, which will now be made at the company’s Normal, Illinois factory, is expected to go into production in the first half of 2024. The company said it will save about $2.25 billion by moving production of the R2 from its planned Georgia factory to its existing factory in Normal.

It’s all part of the plan to hit 400 flights a year: every day and twice on Sundays, perhaps. VG’s approach, which has been performed a few times with test crews and founder Richard Branson himself aboard , has the spacecraft strapped to the belly of a larger, custom aircraft, which gives the former a running start and skips the necessity of rocket acceleration through the densest part of the atmosphere. Though the VMS Eve is certainly an interesting aircraft involved in a distinctly futuristic endeavor — namely, space tourism — it has been in service since 2008. While its limited flights have hardly made a dent in its lifetime, the intervening years have led to numerous improvements and efficiencies that can be built into successor craft, and the time has come to build them in preparation for commercial operations. To that end VG has tapped Aurora Flight Sciences, a Boeing subsidiary originally focused on cutting edge autonomous aircraft, to build two of these production models by 2025. It’s a bit odd, since Aurora’s experience is primarily with building smaller UAVs, not enormous and unusual craft like these, but the company has probably integrated more than a little Boeing DNA since its acquisition in 2017 . These new craft are an “an evolution, rather than redesign” of Eve, a VG representative said, and will not bear a new designation (technically Eve is a WhiteKnightTwo model, an evolution of the White Knight One designed by Burt Rutan years earlier). That explains why the CG render of the new craft is structurally identical the old one, though it’s unclear why it looks like they drew it in SketchUp: In a press release, CEO Michael Colglazier said the new aircraft will be “faster to produce, easier to maintain and will allow us to fly substantially more missions each year.” This echoes the improvements being made to the spacecraft, which VG president Mike Moses described last year as more focused on smoothing out commercial operations than improving performance or “fixing” anything. Though I asked, it remains unclear on what designation the new craft will have — it seems to be unsettled for now and will be revealed only when the craft themselves are rolled out. It’s not necessarily important, but good to know whether these will be something like WhiteKnightTwoPointOne or WhiteKnightThree. Probably neither. Virgin Galactic president Mike Moses on what’s next for the company’s growing fleet The intention of these production models is getting to the target of 400 flights a year, a goal that’s unreachable with the test fleet. Thousands of seats per year means prices drop, though it’s still probably a while before ordinary folks can go to space instead of renting a cabin for the weekend. To be clear, this is all completely different from Virgin Orbit’s aircraft and midair launch system, which is similar in principle but a completely different company and purpose, using a modified 747 to give a boost to an orbital launch vehicle.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/30/relativity-space-inks-deal-with-oneweb-reaches-1-2b-in-terran-r-launch-contracts/,"Relativity Space inks deal with OneWeb, reaches $1.2B in Terran R launch contracts",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Relativity Space will be sending OneWeb’s second-gen broadband satellites to orbit starting in 2025 using its fully reusable 3D-printed rocket Terran R, under a new multi-launch agreement. This is the fifth customer for Terran R, and the only one that has been publicly named, bringing the total value of all binding launch agreements for that rocket to more than $1.2 billion. It’s a high degree of customer conviction in Relativity, which has yet to send even its first rocket, the small, fully expendable Terran, 1 to orbit. “To have such large contracts signed before launching, and before even launching Terran 1, I think is really speaking to the confidence that people have in the team and in our approach,” Relativity founder and CEO Tim Ellis told TechCrunch. While Relativity declined to share the financial terms of this specific deal, the company did confirm that the agreement is for a number of launches in the double-digits. Given that Relativity will be deploying OneWeb’s Gen 2 satellite network under a primary deployment contract — meaning this is what will get the Gen 2 network up for the first time — they’ll likely work fast. “We keep hearing from customers that there needs to be a second, quickly moving, disruptive launch company that has low prices, is reliable and is able to scale production quickly and actually serve what is now becoming an even more kind of supply-constrained market,” Ellis said. To meet the 2025 deadline with OneWeb, Ellis said Relativity will likely conduct the first orbital flight test of Terran R around the end of 2024 or the beginning of 2025. That means these launches for OneWeb will be some of the first Terran R conducts for commercial customers. OneWeb had to scramble to find alternate launch arrangements after it said it would no longer use Russia’s Soyuz rockets, a direct result of the series of sanctions imposed by much of the Western world after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February. The company quickly signed launch deals with SpaceX — a competitor — and New Space India. Those agreements will send OneWeb’s first generation satellites to orbit, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. But talks between OneWeb and Relativity preceded the war, Ellis said. “We were talking to them well before the Russia-Ukraine conflict erupted. This has been in the works for quite some time.” OneWeb aims to achieve global service with its broadband satellite constellation from 2023, when the number of satellites in orbit reaches 648. Terran R is the company’s larger rocket made to serve medium- and heavy-lift markets, with a 20,000-kilogram payload capacity. Although that’s less than SpaceX’s Falcon 9 on paper, which has a capacity of 22,800 kilograms, Ellis noted that if Terran R’s second stage was expendable (like Falcon 9’s), its payload capacity would be over 30,000 kilograms. Terran R is also higher than Rocket Lab’s next-gen rocket Neutron which will have a max capacity of 15,000 kilograms. Like its smaller sister, Terran 1, Terran R is fully 3D-printed. Unlike Terran 1, however, it is designed to be fully reusable. Both rockets will eventually use Relativity’s fully 3D-printed engine, the 250,000-pound-thrust Aeon-R. Ellis said there will be more Aeon-R engines on the first stage of Terran R than previously announced, though he didn’t give a specific number. Both rockets are made using what is the company’s strongest weapon: Stargate, its line of 3D printers. The company has just launched the fourth generation of Stargate, which Ellis said can print up to 10 times faster than the previous generation. But just how fast is that? At the current rate they’re demonstrating, a Stargate can print a Terran 1 fuselage in just five days. “That’s been a really big enabling technology to be able to go as fast as we have been,” he said. They also have the capacity to print an even larger rocket than Terran R, even one potentially comparable of SpaceX’s Starship. “With the 3D-printing tech we can definitely adapt and I think if things change, then we can certainly build something larger.” But, he added, he’s not opposed to being a customer of Starship, either. “Our long-term mission remains that we want to help build an industrial base on Mars and helped make humanity multiplanetary.” The story was updated to include more details about OneWeb and to clarify a comparison between Terran R and Falcon 9 payload capacities.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/23/facebook-pay-rebrands-meta-pay-digital-wallet-metaverse/,Facebook Pay rebrands to Meta Pay as Zuckerberg details plans to create a digital wallet for the metaverse,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced this week that Facebook Pay has officially been renamed Meta Pay. The current product features and overall user experience that people are used to with Facebook Pay will remain the same across across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. The change is rolling out in the United States and will then launch globally over time. Zuckerberg says although the service will remain the same, the rename represents Meta’s first step toward creating a digital wallet for the metaverse. He says his vision for a digital wallet in the metaverse will let users securely manage their identities, what they own and how they pay. “In the future there will be all sorts of digital items you might want to create or buy — digital clothing, art, videos, music, experiences, virtual events and more,” Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post. “Proof of ownership will be important, especially if you want to take some of these items with you across different services. Ideally, you should be able to sign into any metaverse experience and everything you’ve bought should be right there.” Zuckerberg notes that although this vision won’t come to fruition anytime soon, this kind of interoperability will deliver better experiences for people while also bringing larger opportunities for creators. He says the more places people can easily use their digital goods, they more they’ll value them, which in turn will create a bigger market for creators. He also noted that users’ ability to transact more easily will create bigger opportunities for creators. Zuckerberg’s comments come a few weeks after Meta’s head of fintech, Stephane Kasriel, said Meta is in the “very early stages” of considering what a single wallet experience may look like. He said that in terms of its early thinking, Meta is looking at how you can prove who you are and carry that identity into different experiences in the metaverse. “Our path forward is grounded in our mission to empower everyone, everywhere to access the world’s financial system to accelerate financial inclusion and economic empowerment,” Kasriel had said in a blog post at the time. “Designing products and infrastructure with the metaverse in mind today will help facilitate innovation that delivers greater access and real cost savings — before the metaverse even becomes mainstream. Now is the time to lay down the building blocks for the future. Because once that foundation is in place, the potential of the metaverse, and where it can take fintech next, will be limitless.” Meta has been in payments since 2009 and says people use its platforms to make payments in 160 countries and 55 currencies, including person to person, business to business and business to consumer payments. Facebook changed its corporate branding to Meta in October to capture more of the company’s core ambition, which is to build the metaverse. Since then, Meta has started renaming its products to match the new corporate branding. For example, Oculus Quest is now Meta Quest and Facebook Portal is now Meta Portal. It makes sense for Meta to make the change for its payments experience as well, especially as it gears up for the metaverse. Facebook Pay will be renamed Meta Pay soon Topics Consumer News Reporter Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/11/meta-launches-sphere-an-ai-knowledge-tool-based-on-open-web-content-used-initially-to-verify-citations-on-wikipedia/,"Meta launches Sphere, an AI knowledge tool based on open web content, used initially to verify citations on Wikipedia",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Facebook may be infamous for helping to usher in the era of “fake news”, but it’s also tried to find a place for itself in the follow-up: the never-ending battle to combat it. In the latest development on that front, Facebook parent Meta today announced a new tool called Sphere, AI built around the concept of tapping the vast repository of information on the open web to provide a knowledge base for AI and other systems to work. Sphere’s first application, Meta says, is Wikipedia, where it’s being used in a production phase ( not live entries) to automatically scan entries and identify when citations in its entries are strongly or weakly supported. The research team has open sourced Sphere — which is currently based on 134 million public web pages. Here is how it works in action: The idea behind using Sphere for Wikipedia is a straightforward one: The online encyclopedia has 6.5 million entries and is on average seeing some 17,000 articles added each month. The wiki concept behind that means effectively that adding and editing content is crowdsourced, and while there is a team of editors tasked with overseeing that, it’s a daunting task that grows by the day, not just because of that size but because of its mandate, considering how many people, as well as increasingly educators and other institutions, rely on it as a repository of record. At the same time, the Wikimedia Foundation, which oversees Wikipedia, has been weighing up new ways of leveraging all that data. Last month, it announced an Enterprise tier and its first two commercial customers, Google and the Internet Archive, which use Wikipedia-based data for their own business-generating interests and will now have wider and more formal service agreements wrapped around that. To be clear, today’s announcements about Meta working with Wikipedia do not reference Wikimedia Enterprise, but generally adding in more tools for Wikipedia to make sure that the content that it has is verified and accurate will be something that potential customers of the Enterprise service will want to know when considering paying for the service. Meta has confirmed to me that there is no financial arrangement in this deal: Neither Wikipedia becoming a paying customer of Meta’s, nor vice versa. But Meta notes that to train the Sphere model, it created “a new data set (WAFER) of 4 million Wikipedia citations, significantly more intricate than ever used for this sort of research.” And just five days ago , Meta announced that Wikipedia editors were also using a new AI-based language translation tool that it had built, so clearly there is a deeper relationship there. On Meta’s part, the company continues to be weighed down by a bad public perception, stemming in part from accusations that it enables misinformation and toxic ideas to gain ground freely — or if you’re someone who has ended up in “Facebook jail”, believing you have shared something you think is fine, but you still have fallen afoul of over-zealous social police. It’s a mess for sure, but in that regard launching something like Sphere feels a little like a PR exercise for Meta, as much as potentially a useful tool: If it works it shows that there are people in the organization trying to work in good faith. A few more details on the news today, and what might be coming next: — Meta believes that the “white box” knowledge base that Sphere represents has significantly more data (and by implication more sources to match for verification) than a typical “black box” knowledge sources out there that are based on findings from, for example, proprietary search engines. “Because Sphere can access far more public information than today’s standard models, it could provide useful information that they cannot,” it noted in a blog post. The 134 million documents that Meta has used to bring together and train Sphere were split into 906 million passages of 100 tokens each. — By open sourcing this tool, Meta’s argument is that it’s a more solid foundation for AI training models and other work than any proprietary base. All the same, it concedes the very foundations of the knowledge are potentially shaky, especially in these early days. What if a “truth” is simply not being reported as widely as misinformation is? That’s where Meta wants to focus its future efforts in Sphere. “Our next step is to train models to assess the quality of retrieved documents, detect potential contradictions, prioritize more trustworthy sources — and, if no convincing evidence exists, concede that they, like us, can still be stumped,” it noted. — Along those lines, this raises some interesting questions on what Sphere’s hierarchy of truth will be based on compared to those of other knowledge bases. Because it’s open sourced, there may be an ability for the users to tweak those algorithms in ways better suited to their own needs. (For example, a user implementing Sphere to check legal references base may assign more credibility on court filings and case law databases than a user verifying fashion or sports references, which would put a higher emphasis on other sources.) — Meta has confirmed that it is not using Sphere or a version of it on its own platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, which themselves have long grappled with misinformation and toxicity from bad actors. (We have also asked whether there are other customers in line for Sphere.) It has separate tools to manage its own content and moderating it. — Most of all, it seems that something like this is designed for mega scale. The current size of Wikipedia has arguably exceeded what any sized team of humans alone could check for accuracy, so the idea here is that Sphere is being used to automatically scan hundreds of thousands of citations simultaneously to spot when a citation doesn’t have much support across the wider web: “If a citation seems irrelevant, our model will suggest a more applicable source, even pointing to the specific passage that supports the claim,” it noted. While this is in a production phase at the moment, it also sounds like the editors might be selecting the passages which might need verifying for now. “Eventually, our goal is to build a platform to help Wikipedia editors systematically spot citation issues and quickly fix the citation or correct the content of the corresponding article at scale.” Updated with further comment from Meta.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/21/lucid-motors-2024-guidance-2023-results-gravity-suv/,"Lucid Motors will only build 9,000 EVs in 2024 after once predicting it would ship 90,000",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Lucid Motors plans to build just 9,000 electric vehicles in 2024, only 500 to 1,000 more than it made in 2023, as it struggles with demand for its luxury sedans. If it sticks to that number, that means Lucid will wind up building around 10% of the 90,000 EVs it predicted it could make and sell in 2024 when it went public three years ago. The chasm between the new figures and those original expectations spotlights how much freedom companies like Lucid had in promoting the reverse mergers that helped so many become publicly listed . And it’s a sign of the brutal reality Lucid now faces: that it’s still scrambling to find buyers and losing money on every EV it builds. Lucid announced the 2024 production targets on Wednesday alongside its financial results for last year, where it shared that it lost $2.8 billion in 2023. The modest projection comes a few days after the company slashed the prices of its Air sedan by $8,000 . CEO Peter Rawlinson has spent much of the last year talking about how important it is for his company to improve its sales and marketing efforts, while also pointing to the upcoming Gravity SUV as a potential boost. Th e Gravity is one of the reasons Lucid originally forecasted being able to make and ship 90,000 vehicles in a few short years. In fact, in the presentation Lucid used to promote its 2021 merger with a special purpose acquisition company, it predicted the Gravity would outsell the Air sedan in 2024. The reality, though, was that Lucid ran into a number of supply chain and production problems in the early days of the Air and in 2022 had to push back the launch of the Gravity . The company finally revealed the SUV in November 2023, and says it plans to start building them by the end of this year. The Gravity means a lot for Lucid’s immediate future — so much so that the company announced last week that it gave Rawlinson a $6 million cash bonus for unveiling the SUV. Lucid is working on a mid-size platform meant to compete with Tesla’s Model Y, but that won’t come until late 2026 at the earliest. There are other things that could give the company a boost. It only just recently started selling a rear-wheel drive version of its base model Air Pure, which — with the recent price cuts — now starts under $70,000. Rawlinson said Lucid ran into technical challenges with the early production of the Air Pure, but that it is now fully ramped. Lucid also last year announced it was selling some of its EV technology to Aston Martin. Rawlinson said on a call Wednesday that Lucid continues to talk to other companies both in and outside of the automotive industry about striking similar technology licensing and supply agreements. He even said Lucid is “seeing interest in our technology for use in hybrid electric vehicles.” Saudi Arabia, which owns a majority of Lucid Motors through its Public Investment Fund, has also agreed to purchase as many as 100,000 EVs from Lucid over the next decade. The company started shipping Air sedans to the Kingdom late last year, though Rawlinson said Lucid initially ran into “different market dynamics and intricacies unique to that market” that slowed the initial rollout. But he said Lucid “ expect[s] good growth in the region this year.” This story has been updated with details from Lucid Motors’ investor call.

Starting today, the new feature is rolling out to all markets except Quebec. Uber Eats is available in more than 11,000 cities across six continents. When users make a “meet outside” or “meet at door” order on Uber Eats, they’ll be notified that their location is being shared with the courier, which turns on when the courier is three minutes away and the customer is within 100 meters of the drop-off site. Uber Eats stops sharing the location once the order is delivered. Users can also manually turn off the feature at any time. The company hopes its new live location-sharing feature will help solve a major challenge that many couriers face, especially in the warmer months when people are spending more time outdoors, ordering food for birthdays and other events. Domino’s introduced a similar solution in June 2023 when it launched Pinpoint Delivery, which allows customers to drop a pin on the map to get their pizza delivered nearly anywhere. “We’re thrilled to bring location sharing to Uber Eats and help consumers ensure greater reliability with every delivery they receive,” Divya Dalapathi, director of Product Management at Uber, said in a statement. “After launching the feature on Uber rides and seeing great success, we knew that building this feature on Uber Eats would be a game changer—especially for consumers who order from tricky-to-navigate locations like office buildings, parks, and large apartment complexes.” Uber has implemented the live location-sharing feature in its rider app since 2017.

The letter specifically calls out Elon Musk’s behavior on Twitter, and the manner in which he has used the platform to respond to allegations of sexual harassment levied against him by an accuser in May . The letter, which claims as its authorship “[e]mployees across the spectra of gender, ethnicity, seniority, and technical roles,” calls for SpaceX leadership to “[P]ublicly address and condem Elon’s harmful Twitter behavior” in order to “explicitly separate itself from Elon’s personal brand.” It also asks that leadership be held equally accountable across the board for treating employee culture with “the same rigor and urgency” as the company does when correcting hardware errors that lead to irregularities in SpaceX’s spaceflight activities. Finally, it seeks better definition and enforcement of SpaceX’s so-called “no-asshole” and “zero tolerance” policies that apply to employee behavior standards. Just this past week, Musk has taken heat for publicly backing newly elected congresswoman Mayra Flores, a Republican in Texas with a history of promoting QAnon, on Twitter, while maintaining that his political leanings are “moderate.” We’ve reached out to SpaceX for comment but have not heard back as of publication.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/25/spy-agency-pumps-billions-into-orbital-imagery-companies-blacksky-maxar-and-planet/,"Spy agency pumps billions into orbital imagery companies BlackSky, Maxar and Planet",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A massive contract from the National Reconnaissance Office will put billions in the pockets of new and established Earth observation companies BlackSky and Planet, and the more generalist Maxar. The “Electro-Optical Commercial Layer” contracts will be paid out over the next five to 10 years. As you might imagine, incredibly sharp pictures from space, as well as the ability to interpret and act on this imagery, is something of a valuable asset for the NRO. It’s an obvious strategic asset that has proven its value time after time, but increasingly it is not necessary to rely on government-owned assets like spy satellites. “The NRO has a long-standing strategy of ‘buy what we can, build what we must,’” said NRO director Chris Scolese in a press release. And that balance has been shifting. Commercial imaging capabilities on orbit, as demonstrated by Planet and BlackSky in particular, have likely outstripped many assets put in place over the last few decades by the NRO. It’s not particularly feasible to launch a new, “secret” constellation that provides the level of coverage those providers do, so they’re just going to pay for the kind of high-level access the companies always knew would be valuable. Under the new EOCL contracts, the companies have a five-year base (comprising about half the awarded amount) and five additional single year options, so that the services can be extended or augmented at will. Maxar has been providing these services to the feds for decades, and some old capabilities and responsibilities will roll over under the new contract, which it valued at about $3.24 billion in total. The contract adds “shortwave infrared, non-Earth imaging, nighttime imaging and theater direct downlink” to Maxar’s plate, which covers quite a lot of surface area, literally and figuratively. The NRO is interested in intelligence beyond the planet itself, obviously. Planet did not publicly value the contract , but basically defined it as a premium subscription to all their imagery, including from the fleet not yet in orbit. So it may be that they declined to list a value so that the cost of that service could not be reverse engineered from it. Or maybe they’re just private people over there. BlackSky is perhaps the most thrilled of the three, if its stock price is any indication . In addition to providing imagery directly through its own constellation, the company has recently focused on building a data platform meant to be the first stop for anyone looking to make sense of information coming from orbit. CEO Brian O’Toole recently told me “The world is going to be awash with sensors — it’s a massive market that’s massively fragmented. So we started building the software platform that integrates all that using AI and machine learning.” That bet seemingly has paid off, and O’Toole noted today that BlackSky has been tapped to provide imagery for the Ukraine conflict, where hourly scale intelligence has proved invaluable.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/07/startups-are-on-track-to-acquire-more-vc-backed-companies-than-ever-in-2022-heres-why/,Startups are on track to acquire more VC-backed companies than ever in 2022. Here’s why,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Amid a venture funding decline and dearth of IPO activity, startups have found a new way to occupy their time: buying other startups. The notion of startups acquiring other VC-backed companies is nothing new. Meta bought venture-backed Instagram a month before Facebook’s May 2012 IPO; food delivery company GrubHub merged with Seamless in 2013 when they were both still operating off venture funding. But up until the last few years, these transactions were mainly large and infrequent. Now, they are getting smaller and more frequent. In 2021, 1,283 transactions involving startups on both sides of the table took place, according to data from Crunchbase. That compares to 689 in 2020 and 599 in 2019. So far this year, 663 startups have been acquired by other VC-backed companies, with more than half of 2022 left to go. Why is this happening now, during a downturn? The venture funding bull market of the last decade has created a barbell of startups. Last year simultaneously saw a record number of startups crossing the billion-dollar valuation threshold while seed-stage funding broke its own record. Now that the funding fever has come to a screeching halt, the market is filled with late-stage companies with oodles of cash on hand — and no real exit opportunities — and a plethora of early-stage startups. This has created a perfect storm for an increase in startups acquiring other VC-backed companies, Kyle Stanford, a senior analyst at PitchBook, said. “There are over 7,000 venture-backed companies and a record number of seed deals,” Stanford said. “There will be a lot of companies that will struggle to raise this year that will be easy targets for companies looking to acquire.” For some startups, getting acquired by another venture-backed company will be their only option forward. A record number of seed-stage startups doesn’t change the fact that the majority of them won’t go on to raise a Series A, and many of them are fighting to solve the same problems. “There are generally two or three big leaders of a market, and maybe a couple others that are successful,” Stanford said. “Nowadays, we see 10 to 20 startups in very similar categories or sectors raising seed rounds. Obviously, they are not all going to be able to continue on the same path.” For many early-stage companies, getting acquired will be their only option. In contrast, later-stage startups may pursue tuck-in acquisitions to make them more competitive by quickly adding features for greater product-market fit or grow into a lofty valuation from a prior funding round by expanding their revenue base. Maëlle Gavet, the CEO of startup accelerator Techstars, said companies might turn to acquisitions to build out their product offerings, too. If a startup has the cash to spend, sometimes it makes a lot more sense to buy a company for a particular function rather than building the same capability itself. “There is a lot of boardroom conversation around how you have so much cash and this high valuation,” she said. “Growing your business through acquisition will be a lot faster than building it organically.” Jonathan Lehr, a co-founder and general partner at software-focused VC Work-Bench, said that this will be true especially on the enterprise side, as many young software startups would really fit better into a larger company than on their own. “Some companies are just features that shouldn’t have been a full-fledged company,” Lehr said. “Some actually have cool tech but couldn’t wedge into the market on their own.” Some of these transactions will be less about a startup’s product and more about its headcount. Many companies will turn to this strategy as a way to better secure talent, which — up until the recent wave of startup layoffs — was easily one of the largest challenges facing startups. “There was a big push around, ‘Hey, with all this cash, instead of spending it on marketing, go spend it on acquisitions,’” Gavet said. “Acquisitions help them achieve what a lot of other startups suffer from: talent gaps. The war for talent was brutal, and [acqui-hiring] was a great way to solve some of this immediately — at least on paper.” Stanford said that these acqui-hires not only give companies access to executive and engineering talent but also sales personnel who already understand the industry and what potential customers are looking for. Unless the public markets change overnight, this trend looks likely to continue throughout at least this year, Stanford said. Gavet and Stanford agreed that the third and fourth quarters of 2022 will likely be busier than what we’ve seen thus far. “This trend of the increase of venture-backed company acquisitions is not going to go down,” Stanford said. “It will either be the same as 2021 or higher. There are a lot of reasons to look at this data and market conditions and to expect that this trend will stay high.” Topics Senior Reporter, Venture LIMITED TIME: Save $300+ on your ticket, plus an additional 50% on a second for a full immersive day of AI!

https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/08/meta-game-development-platform-crayta-facebook-gaming/,Meta brings game development platform Crayta to Facebook Gaming’s cloud streaming service,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Meta announced today that it’s bringing Roblox-like Crayta, a game development platform that lets you build and play games with your friends in real time, to Facebook Gaming’s cloud streaming service. The company says Crayta provides an easy-to-use developer toolkit and makes game creation more accessible, whether you’re building on mobile or desktop. The company acquired Unit 2 Games , which is the studio behind Crayta, in June 2021. Financial terms of the deal weren’t revealed, but the entire Unit 2 Games team came on as part of the acquisition. Crayta originally launched as an exclusive for Google Stadia but rolled out to the Epic Games Store last year. “Historically if you wanted to have something like this run in this high quality of a 3D environment, that would be really hard to render in a browser or on phones, but being able to do it with cloud infrastructure and then send it down across the network after having already rendered it in the cloud is a pretty big advance,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a video about the launch. By making Crayta available on Facebook Gaming’s cloud streaming service, users don’t need to download the game to their computer in order to play it. The free-to-play game development platform will be available to anyone with a Facebook account. “A lot of times today, people think about the metaverse as 3D experiences you can have in virtual and augmented reality, but I think what Crayta shows is that you can both build and enjoy these kind of experiences really easily on all kinds of 2D environments including just within the Facebook App on phones and on computers,” Zuckerberg said. Crayta’s platform can be used to create and publish a simple multiplayer game in as little as 15 minutes, without the need to code or use other specialized skills, the company notes. The platform allows up 20 people to collaborate on games simultaneously. The launch of Crayta on Facebook Gaming represents Meta’s continued investment toward the metaverse. Although a true “metaverse” may not yet exist, the buzzword has been used by Zuckerberg and Meta a lot over the past year and even fueled its recent corporate branding change. Earlier this year, Meta released financials for its Reality Labs division for the first time and revealed that it lost more than $10 billion last year. The company said it expects the losses will only get bigger this year, which indicates that Meta has seemingly endless money to spend on building out the metaverse and likely has quite a bit of time to pull it off ahead of other smaller companies. As part of today’s announcement, Zuckerberg also revealed that Facebook Gaming is expanding the availability of its catalog of cloud games to Western Europe. Meta says that this is an important step for the company to take, noting that this same infrastructure will be instrumental in delivering metaverse experiences across Meta’s platforms in the future.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/16/faraday-future-headquarters-rent/,Faraday Future in danger of losing LA headquarters for failing to pay rent,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Struggling EV startup Faraday Future owes the landlord of its Los Angeles headquarters nearly $1 million after missing the last two months’ rent, TechCrunch has learned. The landlord, Rexford Industrial, filed a previously unreported lawsuit against Faraday Future this week in Los Angeles Superior Court that accuses the startup of missing its January and February lease payments, as well as associated maintenance fees and taxes. Rexford claims the startup owes it $917,887.26 as a result and is seeking to take possession of the building. A lawyer for Rexford declined to comment. Faraday Future is also being sued by the landlord of an office it has leased in San Jose since 2022. That previously unreported complaint, filed by BXP Realty in Santa Clara Superior Court on January 31, alleges that Faraday Future stopped making lease payments in December, leading to an outstanding balance of $127,311.16. BXP says it applied Faraday Future’s $99,518 security deposit to the balance in January and asked the company to pay the remainder; the startup did not pay that sum. As a result, BXP is looking to boot the startup from the premises. A lawyer for BXP did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “We are actively working with the landlords of our offices in both San Jose and our HQ in Gardena and are in negotiations to resolve the situation with both amicably and as quickly as possible,” a Faraday Future spokesperson said in a statement. The missed payments are the latest sign of trouble for the startup, which only recently began shipping its first luxury SUVs to employees and hand-picked celebrities after nearly 10 years and more than $3 billion in losses. Faraday Future warned shareholders in a December regulatory filing that its ongoing fundraising efforts continue to face major hurdles, and that without a cash infusion, the startup may not have “sufficient resources” to continue operating and “will likely have to file for bankruptcy protection and its assets will likely be liquidated.” Faraday Future became a publicly traded company in 2021 after merging with a special purpose acquisition company. Faraday Future reported just $8.5 million in cash at the end of September 2023. The startup is also under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Faraday Future has survived a series of crises over the years as it attempted to develop and ship its luxury electric SUV, the FF 91. In 2019, after a messy breakup with one of its financial backers, Faraday Future sold the Los Angeles headquarters to generate cash and leased it back from a subsidiary of New York real estate firm Atlas Capital. Rexford assumed Faraday Future’s lease in 2022 after buying the building for $64.3 million. Faraday Future managed to survive long enough to merge with Property Solutions Acquisition Corp. in 2021, a transaction that netted Faraday Future $1 billion in fresh funding. But Faraday Future has spent the intervening years mired in more drama centered around its billionaire founder, Jia Yueting. This story has been updated to include a comment from Faraday Future.

The expansion, which will nearly double the automaker’s Super Cruise network by 2025, will include rural and minor highways that often connect smaller cities and townships. The upgrade comes as automakers are increasingly pushing the boundaries of advanced driver-assistance systems in a bid to attract customers and generate revenue beyond vehicle sales. Super Cruise uses a combination of lidar map data, high-precision GPS, cameras and radar sensors, as well as a driver-attention system, which monitors the person behind the wheel to ensure they’re watching the road. When the system is activated, it will accelerate or brake to maintain a selected following distance from a vehicle ahead, steer to keep its lane position, and make automatic change lanes to pass slower traffic. Drivers will have the ability to deploy the system while towing a trailer as well. The automatic lane change is not available while trailering, the company said. The expanded Super Cruise network will not be accessible to owners of the Cadillac CT6, Chevrolet Bolt EUV and Cadillac XT6, according to the company. Unlike Tesla’s Autopilot driver-assistance system, users of Super Cruise do not need to have their hands on the wheel. However, their eyes must be directed straight ahead. Ford offers a competing hands-free system called Blue Cruise that launched in 2021. Super Cruise launched in 2017 as the industry’s first true hands-free ADAS on the market. However, GM wasn’t viewed as a dominant player — despite the capability of the system — because it severely limited access to Super Cruise. For three years, the system was only available on one model, the Cadillac CT6, and was restricted to certain divided highways. The automaker has slowly expanded its Super Cruise highway network as well, first growing to 200,000 miles and then doubling it to 400,000 in 2022. GM has also added the system to more brands and models. Today, 15 vehicles globally have Super Cruise, including the Chevy Bolt EUV, Chevy Suburban, Chevy Tahoe and Chevy Silverado, the GM Hummer EV SUV and all Cadillac models. The Super Cruise with trailering feature will be offered in new models like the 2024 Chevrolet Traverse or 2024 GMC Acadia As GM crept forward, Tesla gained followers largely due to accessibility. Tesla made its Autopilot system standard in all of its vehicles and drivers could access it on all highways. The automaker’s upgraded systems, namely the $12,000 Full Self-Driving software, has added capabilities and can even be used on city streets.

The agency’s Communications Services Project (CSP) will help the private companies develop their near-Earth communications services that could potentially be used for future NASA missions. NASA intends to phase out its own network of communications satellites as it turns its focus to deep space exploration, so the commercial partnerships would fill the void in service. The companies selected for the CSP program are as follows, listed with the funding granted by NASA to each: This is just the first phase of these grants; NASA also expects each of the companies to “match or exceed its contributions … totaling more than $1.5 billion of cost-share investment” over the five-year duration of the program. “By using funded Space Act Agreements, we’re able to stimulate industry to demonstrate end-to-end capability leading to operational service,” said Eli Naffah, CSP project manager at NASA’s Glenn Research Center, in a press release . “The flight demonstrations are risk reduction activities that will develop multiple capabilities and will provide operational concepts, performance validation, and acquisition models needed to plan the future acquisition of commercial services for each class of NASA missions.” It’s an approach NASA has used before. The agency provided funding to commercial space companies to develop cargo and crew transportation to the International Space Station (ISS) through the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program and the Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program. Both programs have proven successful, with NASA ultimately contracting SpaceX and Orbital ATK to provide cargo transportation and SpaceX and Boeing to provide crew transportation. Of course the entire industry of satellite communications is changing, as noted by the fact that SpaceX took the largest share of the grant here, with Amazon’s Kuiper nipping at its heels. But its focus on consumer internet, while practical for a large-scale business, doesn’t always meet the requirements of NASA projects, so as expected a variety of legacy and developing providers are getting cash too.

Relativity certainly thinks so, and has raised about a billion dollars — now Launcher is ready to accept your money too, after demonstrating full thrust on its 3D-printed E-2 engine. Though they’re still a ways off from getting to orbit, a successful test like this is a huge step toward a working launch vehicle. The Launcher Light will be small and very efficient, aiming for a low cost to orbit and quick turnaround. But of course first it needs working engines. Last week saw the first full-scale thrust test of the E-2, down at NASA’s Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. The test demonstrated about 22,046 pound-feet of thrust (about 10 metric tons) using LOX/Kerosene at 100 bars of combustion pressure. This is the thrust they’ve been aiming for in spec sheets and inching toward in other measures, and they reached it “without the hardware melting,” said founder and CEO Max Haot. That’s considered a sub-optimal condition and there’s plenty of opportunity for that to happen in these tests. But it ran for four 10-second stretches and was still in “perfect condition” after, showing off its potential for reusability. The combustion chamber is fully 3D-printed in copper alloy rather than milled or cast like traditional ones. Things have come a long way since the MakerBot; Launcher works with AMCM to fabricate the piece on an M4K printer, and the injector was made on a Velo3D Sapphire. How to build a better rocket company This is only one milestone among many to come for the engine; a turbopump with the necessary 3x pressure of the nominal combustion pressure is being tested in parallel. They’ll be integrated after being individually tested, and the resulting integrated engine will then begin its own proving phase. As for reusability, Launcher Light will be expendable (if cheap) — “But we have plans to scale to a nine-engine version which will have a reusable first stage,” Haot said. “The first step though is to prove we can deliver 150 kg of payload to orbit with an expendable Launcher Light.” It should be a big 2022 for Launcher: the tanks and fairing for the Light should be showable by the end of the year, possibly even a mostly assembled vehicle. And the company’s other big project, Orbiter , will be headed to space for on-orbit testing in October aboard a Falcon 9 rideshare.

Once customers fill out the questionnaire, they can then quickly request a quote from a business about a product or service. Select businesses can now put a “Get Quote” button on their Instagram profile or add a “Get Quote” sticker in their Stories. The new feature marks the latest push by Instagram into e-commerce by making it easier for customers and businesses to interact with each other on the platform. Meta notes that the new button should make it easier for businesses to generate leads and manage conversations. The new feature is rolling out as part of National Small Business Week. Meta is also introducing a slew of other features across its apps. Among the new features is a new capability in Messenger that will allow businesses to send promotional message campaigns to customers who opt in. The company is also making it easier to create Facebook and Instagram ads that open up to a WhatsApp chat by making it possible to create full ads directly from the WhatsApp Business app so that small businesses find new customers and grow faster. In addition, Meta’s Inbox service, which allows businesses to manage customer messages across Messenger and Instagram Direct, is now being integrated with WhatsApp as part of a small test. Meta says that by centralizing communications, businesses will be able to manage messages better and save time. The company plans to share more information about these tests in the future. “We’re announcing new tools for businesses to manage conversations and ads, as well as more ways to generate leads and share more about their business. These tools can improve how small businesses (SMBs) connect with customers and identify higher quality leads,” Meta said in a blog post about the new features. Meta says people’s preferences for how they communicate with businesses are evolving and that they want to be able to communicate with businesses in the same way that they message with friends and family, which is why it’s aiming to make it easier for businesses to start conversations with these new features.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/28/blusmart-ev-charging-funding/,India’s Uber-rival BluSmart pumps up EV charging with $25M investment,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us BluSmart, an Indian ride-hailing startup that competes with Uber and homegrown rival Ola with its all-electric fleet, is looking to boost its battery charging infrastructure as the South Asian nation currently has limited charging stations but aims to expand its electric vehicle (EV) base. The Gurugram-based startup has received fresh funding of $25 million from Switzerland-headquartered impact fund ResponsAbility in a mezzanine structure, including partial equity dilution and debt. The purpose of raising this capital — just in a month following a rights issue of $24 million and a few months after another rights issue of $42 million — is to expand the EV charging infrastructure from the current 35 stations, which operate 4,000 chargers in total, to about 95-100 stations in the next few months. Launched in December 2019, BluSmart currently has a fleet of 6,000 EVs, including around 180 ZS SUVs from MG Motor and the rest of the sedan Tata Tigor cars, which it plans to take to 10,000 later this year. But for that expansion, the startup initially needs to bolster its EV charging infrastructure. The expansion in the charging infrastructure will also help BluSmart generate additional revenues as it looks to open its charging hubs to the public in the future to leverage the country’s plan to electrify 30% of all its four-wheelers by 2030. “This $25 million should help us expand the charging infrastructure from 35 super hubs we have right now to maybe another 60 charging hubs,” BluSmart co-founder Anmol Jaggi told TechCrunch. Jaggi co-founded BluSmart along with his brother Puneet Jaggi and another co-founder, Punit Goyal, in 2019 to take on the duopoly of Uber and SoftBank-backed Ola. It began operating shortly before the global COVID-19 lockdown, severely affecting businesses worldwide and devastatingly impacting ride-hailing services. The startup gained public attention following the ease of the initial lockdown for offering a premium service — months after launching its all-EV fleet in Delhi-NCR. In 2022, BluSmart expanded to Bengaluru and introduced intercity rides from Delhi-NCR within a 62-mile range to cities including Chandigarh and Jaipur. Unlike Uber and Ola, which both offer on-demand cabs in India, BluSmart provides electric vehicle (EV) rides only with scheduling in advance. While this is a significant departure from the norm, BluSmart has no plans to change this model as it requires many more EVs in its fleet to enable the on-demand service. Nonetheless, the distinct model, which requires effort from riders to schedule and wait for their cabs to come, has drawn some adoption. Between 2022 and 2023, BluSmart, which raised a total of $200 million in equity and debt to date and separately received EV asset financing of $200 million, saw its gross merchandise value grow by over 600% to about $20 million from $2.76 million. The startup also saw over 100% growth in monthly active users to 245,000 in December from 120,000 in January last year. It counts BP Ventures, Mayfield India Fund, Green Frontier Capital and Survam Partners among its early backers. In November, BluSmart introduced a loyalty program called BluElite to offer value additions, such as additional waiting time and recurring rides, to riders for paying a subscription of $6 a month or $31 a year. It garnered between 2,000-3,000 subscribers in two months after launch and is contributing to the startup’s bottom line. However, BluSmart is facing the heat due to the ongoing market slowdown and its asset-heavy business model. In 2019, the four-year-old startup announced its plans to raise $250 million in a new round. But that did not work out. It also lost the initial shine of being an EV ride-hailing platform, as Uber partially started onboarding electric cabs in India to support the government’s objective of going electric. Recently, BluSmart introduced its crowdfunding initiative called BluSmart Assure and “rush-hour” pricing, similar to Uber’s surge pricing during rush hours, despite promising that it would never introduce surge pricing on its platform. These moves even attracted criticism for the platform. In a wide-ranging interview with TechCrunch, Anmol Jaggi and BluSmart chief business officer Tushar Garg, who has also become the CEO of BluSmart’s charging business BluCharge, talked about how they are planning to go with the fresh capital and looking at the challenges on their journey. Below are the edited excerpts from the conversation: TC: How are you planning to utilize the fresh capital? Anmol Jaggi: This money is majorly going to strengthen our EV charging infrastructure. For cars, we have a lot of leasing partners who are there, and those leasing partners are already giving us 1,000s of cars. We have already scaled to 6,000-plus cars — 5,000 in Delhi-NCR and 1,000 in Bengaluru. So, for cars, we are decently sorted with our financing. This money will essentially go all for building charging infrastructure. Tushar Garg: BluSmart has always taken pride in the fact that we are a full-stack EV mobility player. We’ve got a lot of crazy hard work done by the teams in the background to ensure adequate funds are available for our expansion on the fleet side. We’ve also always been required to build a very large-scale EV charging infrastructure. With this capital coming in with ResponsAbility, our focus is to build vast amounts of EV charging infra for our fleets and eventually the public. Are you planning to expand the capacity of the 35 charging locations you have or widen your infrastructure by entering new locations? AJ: We can’t expand the capacity in these 35 charging locations because they are already filled to the brim. This money could create 60 such locations so that our total EV charging station count could go to 95. TG: We used to dream of creating an EV charging distribution in the cities we operate in, where every car can get a charging point within 15 minutes of wherever they are. This capital allows us to go from those 35 hubs to maybe 95 or 100 odd hubs and obviously come closer to that dream of ours of making an EV charging point available to any electric vehicle in the city within a 15-minute drive — or maybe even less — in the times to come. You announced plans to have a fleet of 10,000 EVs by March 2024. And you just mentioned that you have 6,000 cabs at the moment. What has been the progress toward that target? AJ: We have 6,000 cars already plying, and as we speak, 700 vehicles are ready to join our fleet in the next 10 odd days. So, we will hit 6,700. Perhaps by March 2024, we should be more or less between 7,500 and 8,000 cars. What is the new timeline for reaching 10,000 fleet size? AJ: By something like July, we will hit the 10,000 number. But everything is subject to the charging infrastructure expansion. What is the reason you could not meet the target of getting 10,000 cabs by March 2024? AJ: It is a fact that we have not been able to ramp up the charging infrastructure to the speed that we wish to. Whether it is financing for cars or Tata Motors’ ability to give us these cars, both are available. So, here, the lead dog is the charging infrastructure. As we build out the charging infrastructure, we will be able to absorb more cars. In fact, in January itself, we are onboarding five new charging hubs: two in Rajouri Garden, one in Dwarka (in Delhi) and two in Bengaluru. This would enable us to onboard 700 more cars because each has between 100 and 150 car parks. Are any of the cabs that BluSmart currently runs on its books? AJ: No, the fleet is not at all — not even one car — is on the books of BluSmart. All the vehicles are leased out to BluSmart by many partners. In fact, we started a retail program called BluSmart Assure in which any individual can lease out a car to BluSmart, and we have a fantastic response to it. What is the average leasing tenure? AJ: The average tenure for the Tata Tigor car would be four and a half years, and for the MG ZS SUV, it is about five and a half years. Will you purchase the vehicles after the leasing period is over? AJ: BluSmart has a roofer to purchase these vehicles. So, if it feels that at the end of the lease period, it wants to buy back the car at a predetermined price, BluSmart can buy the vehicle. Have you repurchased any of these leased vehicles? AJ: If you look at the history, we have had a few of our cars where the lease has started to go over. Depending on that, we have returned a few and a little above 40 we have bought from the lessor and retrofitted their batteries. Is BluSmart unit economics positive now? AJ: No, we are negative. Our contribution one margin is positive, which means that we are profitable on the part of all our variable costs, such as driver salaries and electricity costs. But when it comes to the contribution two margin, which basically includes the lease of the vehicle, we are negative. However, our SUV rides have the contribution two margin positive. What is the loss you are making per cab daily? TG: We are negative, equivalent to one and a half trips. A trip on an average fare is about $5 (400-plus Indian rupees). So, the loss we are making is about $7 (600 Indian rupees) per cab per day. How much are you paying for the maintenance and service of your vehicles? You also mentioned you retrofitted the batteries in some of the cabs you have bought. How much have you paid for that? AJ: The retrofitment of the battery cost us about $3,100 (260,000 Indian rupees). Maintenance and servicing costs are about a cent (80-85 paisa) per kilometer without tires. If we add tires to it, it comes to $0.014 (1.15 Indian rupees) per kilometer. What is the percentage of the revenue contribution from SUVs? AJ: It is double. So, if we have 3% of the fleet as premium (SUV), it will be 6% of revenue. What has been the initial outcome of BluSmart Assure? Will it not be a debt trap for people investing since there is no clarity on how BluSmart would pay them the guaranteed returns despite seeing losses? AJ: We pay more than $1.8 million in lease rentals every month. So, there is sufficient equity that the business has to continue. We have already added more than 150 vehicles under the BluSmart Assure. The ticket size is about 10 cars per person, so 17-18 different investors are already through the program. We aim to add 2,000 more vehicles through it in the next three to four months. So, you could expect many new cars for us to come under the BluSmart Assure program. There is massive demand for people looking to deploy vehicles with BluSmart because they know that their cars will be very well looked after, and every new vehicle that comes onto the platform helps us grow, increase the network and become more profitable. Our expected loss for the financial year 2025 is about $19 million. Do we have enough and more equity to cover that loss? Yes. Are we raising more equity? Yes. Are more and more international investors happy to fund us? Yes. So, people investing in the BluSmart Assure program are considering that BluSmart has already captured a 10% plus market share in Delhi and maybe 12-13% revenue market share. They believe the founders have a great track record, the team and product have proven themselves, and substantial investor backing has always come in. What does BluSmart’s runway look like? AJ: It’s more than two years with the current ResponsAbility money. In 2022, you announced plans to raise around $250 million. But you ended up getting $42 million in a rights round in May, including $5 million in debt, and $42 million in another rights issue in December. Why has it become so hard for BluSmart to raise funds despite its cab plying in two major cities? AJ: On that $250 million announcement, it has been close to 18 odd months of that falling through, so we lived through it. We have made enough clarifications to say that the incoming investors and existing investors could not agree on the terms and conditions of the round, and hence, we could not close it despite having term sheets. It is better to not align in the earlier part than to have a conflict in the later part. The $250 million would have been great. We would have been on a very different trajectory with that amount in the bank. That said, we are constantly raising money, and maybe it’s not that big a sum of $250 million, but it is decent to let us continue our operations and growth. BluSmart has been growing more than 100% year-on-year, which has all been fueled by the $42 million, $24 million and the latest $25 million. So, there are no hard feelings that we could not get the $250 million. It would have been better. But do we have enough money with us? Yes. Are we growing? Yes. Does the customer love continuing? Yes. But why aren’t any storied investors coming to your cap table? AJ: ResponsAbility is absolute as a fabled investor as one could get. But regarding the earlier $42 million and $24 million we raised, we have had the privilege of creating capital for myself and other businesses. If I have my own money available at my disposal, I will be happy to invest more money into BluSmart. So, I would not rule out doing more rights rounds to increase my share in the business. How much have you invested in BluSmart so far? AJ: The three co-founders — me, Puneet Jaggi and Punit Goyal — hold nearly 35% of BluSmart. I have invested about $25 million, while Punit has invested about $4 million and CXOs, comprising Anirudh Arun (operations and marketing head), Rishabh Sood (CTO) and Tushar have put in a total of $2.4 million. Have you attracted new investors’ interest? AJ: Sometime in the middle of the year, we will again start with the next fundraising and use the six months to improve our numbers. Use the six months to take the revenue run rate from $53 million that we had in December to, let’s say, $75 million and use that to decrease the losses from about $7 to maybe $5 per car daily and demonstrate all of that show the trajectory and hopefully, ResponsAbility got convinced, so we’ll have more other people also getting convinced. And, of course, we always have our own money at our disposal. BluSmart started with no-surge pricing as a significant competitive edge against Uber and Ola. But then, earlier this month, you introduced the “rush-hour” pricing. Why did you prefer that change, which has made BluSmart a bit similar to its competitors? AJ: We were getting a lot of complaints from driver partners that they could not complete the rides during the rush hours. That resulted in a dip in their earnings because they could not complete as many trips as possible. So, we found “rush-hour” pricing as a fair way of compensating the driver partners for their effort and nothing else. We are clearly different regarding surge and rush-hour pricing; it is not arbitrary that you could see any random number coming up any day. We have clarified that we’ll be 10-15% more expensive during rush hours. And it is only for a defined hour. In fact, during the non-rush hours, we also decrease the prices. Since the launch on January 9, we have seen a 7-8% increase in the number of trips we are doing. Would you introduce some other future changes that customers could criticize, similar to what Uber and Ola have faced, including random cancellations? AJ: We are always going to follow the zero-cancellation model. Clean cars and an all-electric fleet will also always be a part of our offerings. The rush-hour pricing is something that we have done as a fair move for our driver partners. If there are no driver-partners, there will be no BluSmart.

The Guangzhou-based electric vehicle upstart said at an event this week that it will start developing its highway-specific Navigation Guided Pilot (NGP) for global users in 2024, while the international version of its next-generation, all-purpose XNGP feature will commence development in 2025. “We look forward to enabling overseas users to access XPeng’s autonomous driving that is already available in China,” Xiaopeng He, the firm’s founder and CEO, said at the event. NGP and its souped-up version XNGP are the equivalent of Tesla’s semi-autonomous driving system Full-Self Driving (FSD). Specifically, XNGP is the catch-all marketing moniker for all of XPeng’s advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) features, including highway and urban driving as well as self-parking. While initially using high-definition maps to navigate, XNGP recently removed such pre-computed information so Xpeng vehicles can drive anywhere, relying on sensors like lidars and radars that detect real-time road conditions. Founded in 2014, XPeng first ventured out of China in late 2021, starting with Europe. It has since shipped its plugged-in SUVs and sports sedans to Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden, with Germany, France and the U.K. on the roadmap for 2024. Last year, XPeng commenced sales in Israel, joining a wave of Chinese EV firms flocking to the Middle East .

Houston-based startup Axiom Space will be launching the first fully private crewed mission to the International Space Station on Friday, the start of a 10-day mission that will likely be the first of many for the company. The Ax-1 mission will take off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon and Falcon 9 at approximately 11:17 a.m. ET. The four-person crew should arrive at the ISS on Saturday and spend a total of eight days aboard the station. The crew includes: Connor, Stibbe and Pathy all paid for their tickets; though the exact price hasn’t been released, it’s likely in the tens of millions , Axiom CEO Michael Suffredini suggested. While aboard, the crew will be engaging in a number of scientific experiments — and indeed, Axiom has stressed the scientific, rather than touristy, nature of the flight. “I think there’s an important role for space tourism, but that’s not what Axiom is about,” López-Alegría told reporters in February. The crew “are not space tourists,” he said. A second mission to be led by former NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, Ax-2, is planned for early 2023. Axiom is not only in the business of private spaceflight — the company was also tapped by NASA to install commercial modules on the ISS, with the first module going up in late 2024. The company’s eventual aim is to separate the modules and operate them as a new station upon the ISS’ retirement at the end of the decade. “This mission really represents a significant milestone for our plans for the development of a sustainable [low Earth orbit] economy,” Angela Hart, NASA’s commercial LEO program manager, said during a media briefing Thursday.

NS-20’s crew includes angel investor Marty Allen; nonprofit founder Sharon Hagle and her husband, Tricor CEO Marc Hagle; entrepreneur Jim Kitchen; and Commercial Space Technologies founder George Nield. “SNL” star Pete Davidson was also originally scheduled to launch on the manifest, but he dropped out and was replaced by New Shepard chief architect Gary Lai. The launch livestream above is set to begin at around 7:20 a.m. CT (8:20 a.m. ET), with the launch scheduled to take place roughly one hour after.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/25/meta-store-facebook-store/,Meta wants to sell you the metaverse in its first brick-and-mortar store,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The company formerly known as Facebook is about to have an IRL shop. Meta will open the doors to the Meta Store (almost typed the Meat Store, that’s a very different store — really sort of the opposite) on May 9. The company’s debut shopping experience will be located on the Meta Burlingame campus, home of its Metaverse-focused Reality Labs division, and will be open Monday through Friday. Customers can try out Meta’s various hardware at the store, including the Portal, Meta Quest 2 and Meta’s less feature-rich reimagining of Google Glass, Ray-Ban Stories. While Meta will sell the first two directly in-store, you’ll still have to order the smart glasses through Ray-Ban via a salesperson. The company is also revamping Meta.com with a new tab for shopping online so you don’t have to leave your house for a full-featured brand experience. As far as the Quest 2, Meta’s VR hardware previously sold under its since-retired Oculus brand, customers can try out a decent selection of games, including rhythm game Beat Saber, VR fitness title Supernatural, GOLF+ and Real VR Fishing, for the virtual dad market segment. Mark Zuckerberg pretty much let the cat out of the bag on this one last week in an Instagram post depicting him doing VR much like anyone might, in a futuristic Apple-like retail environment with a huge wraparound screen and Nikes, like any person might wear. The company has apparently been interested in retail stores since at least 2020, according to a report from The New York Times, which accurately detailed many of the forthcoming store’s specifics late last year. A post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck) But, isn’t this the metaverse, one might ask? The mostly theoretical web of virtual identities connecting us to digital retail experiences, and in turn ourselves and one another? Well, you can’t very well sell people stuff in the metaverse without getting people into the metaverse, so Meta has every reason to get its VR hardware in particular out into as many hands as possible. In that sense, it’s sort of surprising that Meta/Facebook didn’t already have a brick-and-mortar store. Now it does.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/22/google-facebook-apple-eu-lobbying-report/,Report reveals Big Tech’s last minute lobbying to weaken EU rules,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A new report has peeled back the curtain on big tech’s frenzied lobbying of European Union lawmakers as they finalize a major series of updates to the bloc’s digital rulebook. It reveals some of the arguments used by tech giants including Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta (Facebook) and Spotify to press their interests behind the scenes in a bid to reshape key components of the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) and Digital Services Act (DSA) — targeting areas such as surveillance advertising and access to platform data for researchers — with the clear intent of shielding their processes and business models from measures that could weaken their market power. The report, which is based on lobbying documents obtained by civil society groups Corporate Europe Observatory and Global Witness via freedom of information requests, also highlights how tech giants have ramped up their spending on regional lobbying since the DMA and DSA were proposed back in December 2020 — with the big five collectively spending over €27M (close to $30M) last year alone. It concludes with a series of recommendations for how policymakers can better protect the democratic process from undue influence by the best resourced corporate giants. Citing publicly disclosed data, the report shows that Apple has increased its spending on EU lobbying the most — almost doubling how much it’s shelling out from €3.5M in 2020 to €6.5M in 2021, meaning it also pulled into the lead among platform peers for total regional lobbying spend last year. Facebook (Meta) had the next biggest increase, growing the size of its EU lobbying budget from €5.5M in 2020 to €6M in 2021. Google also topped up its outlay from €5.8M in 2020 to €6M. While Amazon and Microsoft both made similar increases in regional spending over this period. The DMA, which gained political agreement last month , will apply only to the largest and most powerful intermediary platforms — so called “gatekeepers”; a designation that’s likely to apply to the five ‘big spenders’ in the above chart — introducing a set of operational obligations these giants must abide by up-front. The pan-EU regulation, which is expected to come into force in October, aims to reboot competition in digital markets dominated by gatekeepers and ensure they remain open and fair. Its sister regulation — the DSA — applies more broadly, setting rules for all sorts of digital services which are intended to harmonize online approaches to tackling illegal content and products. This means it touches on areas like content moderation, consumer protection and transparency. And while it applies across digital services a subset of so-called “very large online platforms” (aka VLOPs) will be subject to additional oversight under the regulation — meaning that tech giants will face additional DSA compliance hurdles vs smaller players. At the time of writing the DSA is still pending political agreement — although a deal is expected after Friday’s (April 22) trilogue meeting — so the impact of big tech’s lobbying on EU policymaking should become clearer in the coming days. So what have tech giants been spending their millions on lobbying for as EU lawmakers finalize the DSA and DMA? Read on for a breakdown of their focus areas from the report… One major target for Big Tech lobbyists, per the report, has been around surveillance advertising as tech giants marshalled their millions to block off an attempt to get an outright ban on tracking-based advertising into EU legislation. They succeeded in that goal as an earlier push by some MEPs for an outright ban did not gain full backing of the parliament so did not make it into the trilogue discussions. But the European Parliament did vote to incorporate limits on tracking ads into both the DSA and the DMA — with MEPs backing a ban on processing of minors’ data for targeting ads and a ban on use of sensitive categories of personal data. However the Council position diverged from parliament, toeing closer to the Commission’s original proposal — which had merely suggested ads transparency requirements — so tech giants sought to exploit this to try to water down restrictions on tracking ads, per the report. Inside a European push to outlaw creepy ads Documents obtained for the report show that Google directly lobbied the Commission in a series of high level meetings with top commissioners between November and early January in which the adtech giant raised concerns about the European Parliament’s proposals on advertising — suggesting limits on trackings would be detrimental to SMEs and harm news publishers. “This marked a continuation of Google and Facebook’s strategy throughout the whole discussion on new digital regulations — trying to reframe it away from Big Tech’s immense profits and business model and to instead hype up potential negative impacts for smaller businesses and consumers,” the report notes. “As Google’s leaked lobbying strategy showed, one of its priorities was to focus the discussion on the costs to the economy and consumers.” Between January to the end of March, lobby documents show that Google remained in frequent contact with the Swedish government — arguing on four different occasions against Parliament’s proposal to ban advertising targeted at minors and other limits, per the report. “Their recommendation to national governments was to ‘support the Council / Commission position (i.e. no restraints on targeted ads’). Google argued ‘that the DSA is not the right forum to deal with these issues’,” it adds. There’s a special irony here given Google also led big tech lobbying efforts to delay an update to the bloc’s ePrivacy rules — which explicitly cover tracking technologies like cookies. That update remains stalled even now (the Commission proposal was presented all the way back in January 2017!). So if the tech giant were to have its way there would, it seems, be no ‘appropriate’ legal forum to rein in its surveillance ads empire. Funny that! 🙄 But as it turns out, EU lawmakers in the Council and Parliament were able to agree — through the trilogue process — on including limits to tracking ads. At least that was the position announced last month, at the moment of political agreement on the DMA . At the time of writing the Commission is signalling that limits on targeting advertising will be included in the DSA, with internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, including a ban on targeted advertising to children or based on sensitive data in a tweet storm highlighting “10 things you need to know” about the regulation, for example… 6⃣ Ban on targeted advertising for children 🚫 More #protection against targeted advertising aimed at children — or based on sensitive data. #DSA — Thierry Breton (@ThierryBreton) April 22, 2022 Under the political deal reached between EU co-legislators last month, the DMA requires gatekeepers to gain explicit consent from users to combine their personal data for advertising. But t he French presidency of the Council also said then that they had agreed complementary provisions to limit tracking ads would also be included in the text of the DSA (still to be agreed via trilogue) — signalling that the parliament’s goal of limits on processing children’s data for ads or using sensitive data for ads would make it into EU law. So what did Google’s lobbyists do next? According to the report, the tech giant continued pushing against any/all limits on surveillance ads — but also evolved the lobbying tactic, by suggesting to Member States governments ways in which restrictions could be watered down in the final text to limit their impact on its ability to track and target web users. “On 22 March 2022, the day of the final DMA trilogue, Google sent the Swedish government its thoughts for future trilogue meetings,” notes the report. “Google’s positions reflected the up to date state of the ongoing discussions. Google continued to oppose concrete new proposals regarding user consent to tracking and banning the use of sensitive data for advertising. Perhaps more interesting though, Google now seemed to understand that likely there would be some new limits to targeted advertising. So Google offered suggestions about how these should be drafted: the ban on targeting minors should be limited to ‘known minors’ and behaviour advertising should be defined as the use of individual profiling.” As the report points out, Google’s fall back positions here are no accident — given that the tech giant has been working for several years to retool its tracking apparatus — under its so-called Privacy Sandbox plan — which proposes to switch from individual-level tracking and targeting to cohort or (now) topic-based targeting which will continue to subject web users to behavioral targeting just now putting them into buckets of eyeballs, not solo pairs. So — to spell it out — if EU lawmakers were to limit the definition of behavioral advertising as Google suggests it could simply circumvent any limits on its flavor of behavioral advertising by saying it does not target individuals ergo the legal restriction simply doesn’t apply. Digging into Google’s push to freeze ePrivacy Similarly, a final text that would ban advertising to “known minors” would allow Google to claim it does not know the age of users who are not logged into its services (and potentially even users who are logged in as it does not explicitly age verify users) — again avoiding the need to restrict its behavioral targeting by default across most services (barring any it directly targets at children, such as YouTube kids). Per the report, Google’s lobbyists didn’t stop there. They also sought to water down ad transparency requirements — pushing back against proposals that would allow users to know the criteria used to target them specifically, including when ads were targeted at kids and — in “detailed suggestions” to national governments — proposed that they should “seek to delete the obligation to disclose the criteria used for targeting, even when ads target vulnerable people like children”. “The documents show Google taking a central position lobbying against limits to surveillance ads,” the report adds. “But they weren’t alone. Facebook, and other European companies [including Spotify] and publishers also resorted to trying to persuade national governments to oppose the Parliament’s position.” Another big target for Big Tech tech lobbying was around data access for NGOs and public scrutiny… On this issue, which is core to the DSA’s ability to deliver on the goal of ramping up accountability around major platforms, the report details particular moves by Spotify and Google to limit how much access external researchers can gain to platform data — such as to carry out research into the societal impact of recommender algorithms. Civil society groups have been pushing to strengthen the Commission proposal in this area — to increase external scrutiny of VLOPs by forcing them to give access to data on algorithmic content ranking systems to vetted external researchers so they can study their function. But Spotify and Google have been busy pushing back against closer scrutiny of how their AIs rank and recommend content to users, per the report. “The world’s biggest music streaming service didn’t want the transparency requirements to include detailed lists of parameters, as was introduced by the Parliament. On the other hand, it welcome the Parliament’s last-minute introduction of exceptions to recommender transparency, including the protection of intellectual property and trade secrets,” runs one section on Spotify’s lobbying. “In March this year, Spotify followed up to add its comments ‘regarding the latest compromise proposals on Recommender Systems’. The company supported the ‘evolution of the text’ regarding recommender transparency and welcomed ‘a clarification in a Recital that these rules do not prejudice IP [intellectual property] rights and trade secrets’,” it adds. Google, meanwhile, was lobbying Member State governments to limit data access for public authorities and vetted researchers to urgent health threats. So in this scenario Europeans might have to wait for the next pandemic to get external scrutiny of YouTube’s recommender engine! Where the DSA will actually end up on this issue isn’t clear at the time of writing. Google also questioned whether non-profits organizations should get data — seeking to spread fear that this could put “ user data and privacy and confidentiality of information at risk”, according to lobbying documents obtained for the report. “T he company asked national governments to oppose the Parliament’s position and instead support the Council’s mandate. Taken all together, Google’s suggestions would make external scrutiny of the ways in which services like Youtube amplify or de-prioritise content nearly impossible,” it adds. The report also reveals Google opposed proposals that would require platforms to “ make the information on the main parameters for recommender systems and the functionality to opt-out from personalised recommendations directly accessible from the content itself” — presumably because that would make it too easy for users to figure out how to turn off unwanted content recommendations. Privacy not a blocker for ‘meaningful’ research access to platform data, says report On the DMA, Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook were all spotted in documents obtained for the report trying to soften the proposal during its last stage. Apple, for example, brought its (now) familiar argument against moves to force it to open up its App Store and mobile OS, such as by allowing sideloading of apps or other types of interoperability, to discussion tables in the region. “ The company’s main argument was that increasing data access, sideloading and interoperability would reduce user privacy and security,” the report notes, going on to conclude: “While Apple could not successfully stop interoperability and sideloading entirely, the final text does introduce a security safeguard, which will enable the company to try to justify not complying with these obligations.” It also highlights one particular strand of collective lobbying by Big Tech targeting the DMA that looks intended to enable a repeat show of an oft used tactic against enforcement of existing EU laws which threaten how they like to operate — such as the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). This tactic boils down to one word: Delay. Per the report: “[T] he top level message from the Big Tech companies to policy-makers regarding the DMA was the same across the board: Big Tech wanted to build a dialogue between the DMA’s regulator — the European Commission — and the companies covered by it — the gatekeepers, into the text and the regulatory approach. “They brought this wish up consistently at the high level meetings, such as the December meeting between Google and [Margrethe] Vestager’s cabinet. There Google said that regarding the DMA their ‘core argument towards the Parliament was the need for regulatory dialogue and the opportunity to individually justify certain practices’. Google repeated the same message to Breton’s cabinet in January — ‘Proper regulatory dialogue is important to ensure the enforcement of the DMA’. “On the very same day, Nick Clegg, Facebook’s head lobbyist, told Commissioner [Didier] Reynders, that for Facebook ‘it would be helpful to have the possibility of having a dialogue with regulators on questions concerning compliance’. “Amazon, in turn, told the Swedish government that it was ‘more comfortable with content of the Council compromise proposal than with the European Parliament’s amendments.’ The company also raised concerns that specific measures had been moved from Article 6 to Article 5, which would mean they would be automatically applicable and not dependent on a regulatory dialogue.” Thing is, the whole point of the DMA is to bring in an ex ante competition regime for the bloc — via a set of ‘dos and don’ts’ that are supposed to apply up front for companies designated as gatekeepers, i.e. rather than antitrust authorities having to do the slow and painstaking work of building a case against a particular abusive behavior while the market suffers But there is — potentially — a sliver of wiggle room, at least for obligations set out in Article 6 of the DMA. For those requirements, the regulation allows for a dialogue between the Commission and relevant companies over how best to comply. Which, well, sounds like it could be spun into delay heaven. The report summarizes the main aim of Big Tech’s lobby campaign against the DMA as being to “expand this dialogue as much as possible”, with Corporate Europe Observatory noting it fingered this as a key priority for Facebook, Google and Apple since last summer. It also quotes another lobby transparency group, Lobbycontrol , which has argued that Big Tech’s aim here is to “gain time — and first of all an entrance point for challenging the DMA’s obligations.” Facebook’s lead EU privacy supervisor hit with corruption complaint The painstakingly slow ‘ regulatory dialogue ‘ which Facebook and other tech giants have managed to establish with their lead EU privacy regulator — Ireland’s Data Protection Commission — since (and, indeed, even before) the GDPR came into force in 2018, enabling them to successful delay enforcement despite multiple open investigations into a variety of aspects of their businesses, is likely providing Clegg & co with plentiful inspiration for the sort of friction-filled conversation they want signed off and baked into the DMA to create a legally viable ‘back and forth’ that lets them delay actually changing abusive practices for as long as humanly possible. It’s not yet clear how successful the tech giants have been in this regard. However the Commission has, in recent weeks, been spotted making some concerning noises on the topic of DMA enforcement to anyone who actually wants to see regulators crack down on Big Tech, as consumer protection experts have observed… I cannot believe that the Commission talks so lightly about #DMA enforcement… it’s the Commission’s kitchen; it will take time to implement; we don’t have resources etc. Seriously people? Why on earth did the legislator (and everybody else behind) work so hard to get this law? — Agustin Reyna (@arcapde) March 31, 2022 “Ultimately the scope of regulatory dialogue in the DMA has been changed to allow the gatekeepers to initiate it. However, it will still be up to the Commission to decide whether or not to engage. We will have to wait and see how this plays out in practice,” is the report’s cautious conclusion on this. In recent days, others have raised concerns about another potential loophole in the DMA — which, if they’re right, could see a history of failed GDPR enforcement against Big Tech tech being leveraged by the self-same giants to avoid freshly inked obligations in the DMA. Earlier this month, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL) drew together signatures from a long list of competition and privacy experts to a letter that warns of “a severe flaw in Article 5(1)a of the latest DMA text” which they suggest will “help Big Tech firms undermine data protection and competition”. The concern is that gatekeepers will continue to evade the GDPR’s purpose limitation principle by bundling consent for combining user data across multiple services into a single opt-in — thereby making it harder for users to deny — which is essentially how adtech giants like Facebook have evaded existing EU regulations, continuing to track and target web users in the region despite the GDPR’s requirement for unbundled consent (Facebook does not offer an opt out of behavioral advertising; to use its service you have to ‘agree’ to being profiled for ads). Let’s make sure, ⁦ @Andreas_Schwab ⁩, 5(1)a closes the loophole for gatekeepers to combine data across all their many services and businesses whenever the user agrees to a single, all-embracing opt-in, undermining the very objectives of the DMA https://t.co/ZDDeEmb6K2 — Angela Mills Wade (@epc_angela) April 20, 2022 The parliament’s rapporteur on the DMA file, MEP Andreas Schwab, has rejected the concern in recent days — suggesting that the DMA does not change the GDPR. And indeed, in a letter responding to the ICCL which we’ve reviewed, that “t he consent requirement under the DMA builds on the GDPR consent”. He has also claimed there’s “no need to fear circumvention” because the Commission will be in charge of enforcement. Aka, no more forum shopping. However signatories to the letter continue to warn that gaps in GDPR enforcement create a problem for effectively enforcing the DMA — unless the Commission acts quickly to provide guidance and bring cases. Collective concern is #GDPR is not enforced today. So indeed now falls on Commission to be very clear about how it will require rules to be met in practice as part of compliance. There’s a major gap in enforcement to be filled, need guidance & cases soon @johnnyryan — Cristina Caffarra (@Caffar3Cristina) “Gatekeepers will try to use the ambiguity to their advantage,” warns the ICCL’s Johnny Ryan. “It is essential that the Commission issues quick and clear guidance and enforcement decisions to stop that.” How EU lawmaking is structured means the Commission’s legislative proposals are typically modified, via a co-legislative process, which loops in the (directly elected) European Parliament and Member States’ national government representatives, via the European Council — which together amend, vote and negotiate to try to reach a compromise on the final details of the law. This means that there are, at least from one perspective, multiple point at which lobbyists can seek to influence — or indeed block — EU policymaking. This starts with the Commission itself, as the EU’s executive body drafts and thus frames legislative proposals; moving on to MEPs who play a key role by voting for amendments and to set the parliament’s negotiating position (typically prefigured via committee vote/s); and extending to Member States’ governments which are represented on the Council and lead the so-called trilogue negotiations with the Parliament and Commission to seek a compromise via a rotating presidency structure that sees one Member State (currently France) responsible for producing compromise texts on behalf of the Council. So, in short, it’s a lobbyists’ picnic! US giants top tech industry’s $100M+ a year lobbying blitz in EU The latter stage trilogue negotiations are especially problematic, being conducted entirely behind closed doors — thereby reducing transparency on how exactly policy is being reshaped, as the report underlines: “This process is one of the most secretive stages of EU policy-making, held entirely behind closed doors and with nearly no public access to the discussions. The EU Institutions have argued that this secrecy is needed in part to prevent lobbying pressure on the policy-makers. “New lobby documents obtained from the European Commission and the Swedish government via freedom of information requests show that intense corporate lobbying is happening regardless of the lack of transparency.” The details that the civil society groups were able to glean on big tech’s lobbying around the DMA and DSA are only partial, as the report notes that responses to freedom of information requests varied. However they say the documents they did obtain showed that tech giants like Google continued to target the trilogue process even after the Council had agreed its negotiating positions — meaning they are shown trying to grasp a very last minute, non-transparent opportunity to favorably water down measures that could shrink their market power. “We can now confirm that corporate lobbying of EU capitals continues even after the Council agrees its positions and starts trilogue negotiations with the Parliament and Commission,” the report authors write. “While only Sweden gave us extensive access to these documents, we can expect that all EU governments must be on the receiving end of similar lobby efforts.” “The lobby documents also reveal that Google remained in frequent contact with the Swedish government from January to the end of March (the time when we placed our freedom of information request). During this period, the tech giant would send in analysis of the difference positions, adding the company’s own analysis, and all the while replicating the EU Institutional format of documents with four columns,” they go on. “As the discussions went on behind closed doors, Google pitched in with ‘specific language on articles currently discussed’ and suggested ‘concrete amendments’, showing a strikingly live knowledge of what was happening in the negotiation process.” According to the report, Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook — alongside European firms such as Spotify and the copyright industry — actively sought to influence the trilogues themselves, meaning they were trying to exert influence during the least transparent point of the co-legislative process. The lobbying tactics they are reported to have used included: Corporate Europe Observatory and Global Witness argue that this evidence of lobbying taking place during trilogues “shows how the lack of transparency benefits big corporate lobbies and adds weight to the urgency of finally opening the trilogues process up to the public” — further suggesting: “This secrecy means that only the well-resourced and well-connected lobbying actors can follow and intervene in trilogues, and excludes citizens from crucial discussions that will have an impact on their lives.” “National governments have a say in EU policy-making via the Council. This is often referred to as the EU’s ‘black box’, as it is difficult for citizens to know who is lobbying their national government on EU policies, or even what position their national government takes in the Council. This approach, combined with the fact that lobbying at member state level requires massive resources and good connections, creates the conditions for undue corporate influence,” they add. The report makes a series of recommendations to protect EU policymaking against undue influence by the most well-resourced lobbyists, based on the NGOs’ tracking and analysis of the DSA and DMA process since the drafting stages. Its suggestions include shedding light into the trilogues by publishing an up-to-date calendar of meetings, including summary agendas, and proactively publishing the four-column document (which details co-legislator positions and amendments) on a rolling basis; boosting transparency and democratic accountability at the Member State and Council level including by requiring disclosure of each country’s position; putting limits on one-to-one lobby meetings and replacing them with public hearings as much as possible; and requiring EU institutions to proactively seek out those who have less resources, such as SMEs, independent academics, civil society and community groups. Other recommendations include beefing up the existing EU Transparency Register to improve transparency on lobbying; putting in place proper funding transparency requirements that mandate think tanks and other organisations to reveal their funding sources; strengthening ethics rules to block the revolving door between EU institutions and Big Tech firms and establishing an independent ethics committee which can launch investigations and implement sanctions. The report authors also urge EU officials and policymakers to be sceptical of those lobbying them — writing that they “should question their funding sources, check their information and data sources and denounce any type of wrongdoing or non-transparent/unethical lobbying they encounter”. They also recommend they should not attend or participate in events or debates that are closed to the public, held under Chatham House rules, or that do not disclose their sponsorship.

stagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us When was the last time you watched an automotive company wax poetic about diesel engine controllers for Class 8 trucks? Or a tech conference keynote that touts the benefits of oxygen enrichment in blast furnaces to make steel? Or how to burn low-sulfur bunker fuel in oceangoing container ships? Probably never. So why did Hyundai devote half its CES keynote to a technology that’s best suited to long-haul trucking, steelmaking and maritime shipping? The simple answer is greenwashing. It’s true that Hyundai has invested in hydrogen fuel cells for decades, but it has also been one of the more successful legacy automakers at navigating the electric transition. It’s odd that a company with so much momentum on its side would throw a hydrogen Hail Mary. But maybe Hyundai’s EV rollout isn’t going as planned. Maybe the vehicles aren’t as profitable as the company would like. Maybe the company is having a hard time securing batteries. Or maybe it realizes that over 90% of its sales are still powered by fossil fuels and that by EV market share, the company is lagging. It might be the world’s third largest automaker overall, but it’s only in eighth place when it comes to battery EVs. Enter hydrogen, a sector with a green aura about it, a useful distraction from more polluting realities. And since meaningful progress is still a decade or more away, it’s hard to hold the company to its claims. Yet the claims made onstage won’t be particularly impactful, even if Hyundai follows through. The company says it will produce 3 million tons of hydrogen for its steel mills by 2030. That will give Hyundai Steel the capacity to produce 60,000 metric tons of green steel, or 0.0025% of the subsidiary’s 24 million metric ton capacity. Hyundai also said it will use some hydrogen in drayage trucks at ports and factories, an odd choice given that drayage is one of the easiest forms of trucking to electrify with batteries. If that wasn’t enough, Hyundai also says that it will generate it from biogas and waste plastic. Because economically splitting water is too easy? The biogas would come from digesters containing bacteria that chomp on food and other organic waste (and landfills, presumably). The methane in the resulting mélange then has to be separated from the other resulting gases, and the hydrogen cracked off the methane molecules. Each step requires energy and drives up cost. Chang Hwan Kim, head of battery and fuel cell development at Hyundai, didn’t detail how the company would strip hydrogen from methane, but the most widely used method is steam reformation, an energy-intensive process that produces about 9 kg of CO 2 for every kilogram of H , according to Argonne National Lab . Hyundai might call the scheme clean, but no one would call it green. The hydrogen-from-plastic technique, which Hyundai said it has patented, is similarly complex. In it, plastic is melted and gasified so the hydrogen can be cracked off the gaseous hydrocarbons. Each step would be energy intensive, and the whole endeavor will produce numerous and probably unpredictable pollutants. If the process has any hope of being cleaner than simply burning diesel, it will have to scrub or capture those pollutants, adding more complexity and cost. Together, waste-to-hydrogen and plastic-to-hydrogen have to be two of the most convoluted, energy-intensive ways to make the gas. They’re practically the chemical equivalent of Rube Goldberg machines. Until we see life cycle analyses detailing the climate and environmental impacts of these hydrogen production methods, they’re little more than fodder for splashy YouTube titles . But greenwashing isn’t the only reason Hyundai has launched a hydrogen PR blitz. Behind closed doors, Hyundai is almost certainly worried about China’s stranglehold on the lithium-ion battery supply chain. Though South Korean companies are major manufacturers, Chinese companies dominate the markets for many components, including cobalt, graphite and lithium itself. Hyundai is dependent on Korean battery giants who themselves are at the mercy of Chinese suppliers. (Fuel cells also require expensive metals like platinum, but Hyundai has said it’s made progress reducing the amount required.) On the other side of the equation, Korean automakers received an unwelcome surprise when the Inflation Reduction Act required certain levels of American content and assembly to qualify for EV rebates. Suddenly, Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 became a lot more expensive relative to the competition. Squeezed between China and the U.S. on EVs, Hyundai would no doubt like to free itself from geopolitics of critical minerals, but it knows it can’t go running back to fossil fuels, either. Jaehoon Chang, Hyundai’s CEO, said as much: “Hydrogen is fair. Hydrogen ensures global fairness through its high accessibility. It dissolves the divisions through the countries, resolves the energy imbalance caused by geographical disparities.” (I probably don’t have to point out that Chang’s plan for energy freedom relies heavily on one particular South Korean company’s fuel cells and electrolyzers.) It’s not hard to see why Hyundai executives view the world through a geopolitical lens: For decades, the company has felt pressure from myriad stakeholders, like from OPEC, from countries anxious to tackle climate change, and now from the great powers struggling for control over the lithium-ion battery supply chain. For all I know, Hyundai execs might find hydrogen to be a useful delay tactic, stalling the decarbonization of their fleet, while also thinking that it could be their geopolitical trump card when the world finally phases out fossil fuels. To those execs, I say good luck. Geopolitical machinations don’t always work out as planned.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/11/hertz-sell-evs-tesla-fleet-gm-polestar-gas/,"Hertz is selling 20,000 EVs and replacing them with gas cars",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Hertz is selling off a third of its electric vehicle fleet, which is predominantly made up of Teslas, and will buy gas cars with some of the money it makes from the sales. The company cited lower demand for EVs and higher-than-expected repair costs as reasons for the decision. The sell-off began last month and will continue through 2024. As some electric vehicle-focused blogs have noted, they’re being sold at steep discounts . The company said in a Thursday morning filing that it is recognizing “approximately $245 million of incremental net depreciation expense related to the sale,” which is a dry way of saying it’s taking a bath on the decision. Hertz told shareholders that it believes it will be able to make up that loss in the coming years. Hertz’s move to slash its EV fleet comes as electric vehicle sales growth has cooled from record highs. The news also follows recent comments from Hertz’s global CEO Stephen Scherr about how the rental giant was dealing with high repair costs — in part because many of the Teslas were being used by Uber drivers — and dramatic depreciation thanks to Tesla’s drastic price cuts. Just two years ago, Hertz announced plans to buy 100,000 EVs from Tesla by the end of 2022. The news helped Hertz distance itself from a chaotic bankruptcy and pushed Tesla’s valuation over the $1 trillion mark for the first time. But it never happened. Instead, as of October 2023, Hertz had only purchased 35,000 Teslas and its entire electric fleet included about 50,000 EVs total. Scherr maintained at the time that his company was “committed” to buying 100,000 cars from Tesla, even while he admitted that the automaker’s price cuts had shrunk the value of its modest EV fleet . Hertz didn’t just overpromise with Tesla. It announced plans in 2022 to buy up to 175,000 EVs from General Motors , and another 65,000 from Polestar . The company did not say Thursday how its decision to sell a third of its EV fleet will impact those plans, and didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/07/max-q-earth-observation-is-the-place-to-be-in-space/,Max Q: Earth observation is the place to be in space,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Your friendly neighborhood Max Q welcomes you to the week of February 7! This past week saw some strong signs that the big boom in commercial space for the foreseeable future is going to land in Earth observation. It’s not like this has been an ignored market in the past: GPS is basically a type of EO. But changes in market dynamics, as well as cost and availability of related technologies (not to mention the cost for a ride to space), have all come together in a way that ends up being kind of a perfect storm. Don’t forget to sign up to get the free newsletter version of Max Q delivered to your inbox. One of the earliest commercial players in the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging market has raised a sizeable Series D funding round , bringing its total raised to nearly a third of a billion. SAR basically means satellite-based Earth imaging that allows you to see through cloud cover, the darkness of night or basically anything else that might obscure a regular old visible light camera. The company now claims that it’s second only to SpaceX in terms of the amount it has raised while remaining a private company. That’s not just important because of bragging rights: It’s a clear signal from private equity investors that this is an area they expect to become a lot bigger and more profitable in the future, particularly if helped by some fuel for the fire. Another EO startup at the opposite end of its lifecycle has raised a significant amount of new money, in the form of a $4 million contract award sourced from an initiative run by the government of Canada. The funding vehicle backs startups working on clean technology innovation, and doesn’t take equity, instead parceling out its awards over a set term in response to the startup meeting certain milestones. This comes hot on the heels of its $4.5 million seed round, which includes both equity backing and a Canadian government grant (separate from the injection today). For a young startup that’s still small, that means a considerable war chest without having to hand out all that much in terms of ownership. Wyvern’s business is hyperspectral imaging, which, like SAR, lets you see more and with more detail than traditional optical imaging. Hyperspectral has long been too expensive to commercialize properly, and restricted by certain governments (i.e. the U.S.) in terms of its use by private companies — but all that’s changing, and the gold rush is on. Starlink has now been available for quite a while, but a new offering promises better connectivity for those willing to fork over more money. It’s quite a bit more money — 5x more at $500 monthly, but for that price you get a better receiver that can handle moving more internet bits up and down (150-500Mbps, up from 40-250 on the consumer offering, per SpaceX). This one’s squarely aimed at businesses, which is a good idea for Starlink in terms of seeking much more recurring revenue from a less price-sensitive customer segment. SpaceX launches yet more Starlink satellites and an NRO satellite . Blue Origin tests the jettison process for its huge New Glenn rocket payload fairing Rocket Lab is opening a new Space Systems complex in Colorado to add to its growing U.S. footprint.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/01/satellite-vu-prepares-to-launch-its-thermal-imaging-satellite-constellation-with-21m-a-round/,Satellite Vu prepares to launch its thermal imaging satellite constellation with $21M A round,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Equipped with $21 million in new funding, Satellite Vu is almost set to send up its initial seven-satellite constellation in 2023 and begin its planned thermal monitoring of the planet. The company’s orbital view of heat and cold could lead to serious economic insights — and insights of other kinds, as hinted by the addition of Lockheed Martin and In-Q-Tel to the list of investors. Satellite Vu will add an interesting capability to the rapidly evolving set of earth imaging products out there. While most are focused on visible light (e.g. Planet) or 3D structure from radar (e.g. ICEYE), this startup collects thermal imagery, something that’s applicable across a wide variety of industries. As founder and CEO Anthony Baker explained when we covered the company’s seed round last year, thermal imagery lets you know whether a building is occupied or not, what areas of a city have lots of traffic, whether a factory is leaking heat or coolant or whether ground water is disappearing or advancing. “Our technology will be used to monitor the thermal footprint of buildings, to derive insights and efficiencies into economic activity, as well as looking at waste pollution of waterways and assisting in disaster relief,” Baker said in an email to TechCrunch. So far the U.K.-based company has validated the demand for its product by performing high-altitude flights and using the Satellite Vu imaging hardware to scan sites or entire cities. These proof of concept flights have proven so popular that the company has actually planned regular operations until the satellites go up. That should be sometime in early 2023; they’ve signed a contract with SpaceX to go up on one of the launch company’s rideshare vehicles, which would deliver the seven satellites that would make up the initial constellation. The optics that are the company’s secret sauce have been upgraded since their atmospheric flight days and now provide better daylight imagery, and the satellites themselves have been made more maneuverable so they can take more shots per pass. The intelligence and defense applications of the technology are clear, though Baker assured me that with a resolving power of about 3.5 meters per pixel, the satellites are not capable of seeing individual people. Of course they may see vehicles, crowds and other larger features that indicate people, but this isn’t a tactical asset. (By comparison, other orbital thermal imaging resolves around 100m per pixel.) That said, it’s obviously a commercial source for valuable info, which seems to have lured Lockheed and In-Q-Tel into the fold for what the company is referring to as an A2 round. “The round was fully committed for £15 million,” back in October, Baker wrote. “But we wanted to include Lockheed Martin, In-Q-Tel and Contrarian in the round since they needed a little more time. The management and current investors appreciated the importance of having a strong syndicate to fund the constellation at Series B and highly valued these new participants.” Of course the cost of a multi-satellite constellation is not trivial, but Satellite Vu seems to be moving deliberately and checking all the right boxes. Combining defense applications with the potential to help track and combat climate change and pollution seems like as close to a sure thing as you can get in this business right now.

But I have never sent anyone a voice message — ever. Turns out, others do. WhatsApp said on Wednesday that users on its gigantic messaging app send an average of 7 billion voice messages every day. Communication by the means of voice notes — that like their text counterparts, are protected by end-to-end encryption — are popular because they allow people to “have more expressive conversations,” the Meta-owned messaging app said. “Showing emotion or excitement through voice is more natural than text,” said the app operator, whose service is used by over 2 billion users to send more than 100 billion messages every day (at last count, over two years ago). The growing adoption of voice messages — a remarkable and seemingly unparalleled feat — doesn’t necessarily come as a surprise, however. In many emerging markets, for instance, we have seen a segment of the new smartphone users show an inclination toward preferring voice over typing . (WhatsApp did not offer insights into the usage of voice messages across different nations today.) To mark the milestone, WhatsApp is adding a host of new features and refinements to its voice notes functionality. These include the ability to pause a voice note recording and then getting back to it later, as well as the option to listen to recordings at up to 2x speeds.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/15/meta-developing-web-version-horizon-worlds/,Meta is developing a web version of Horizon Worlds,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Meta is working on a web version of its social virtual reality Horizon Worlds platform, the company’s CTO Andrew “Boz” Bosworth revealed in a tweet. The expansion would allow users to try out Horizon Worlds without having to use Quest VR headsets, which is currently the only way to access the virtual world. Bosworth’s tweet about the web version of the platform was part of a thread defending Meta’s 47.5% cut of sales in Horizon Worlds. The 47.5% figure includes a platform fee of 30% for purchases made through Meta’s Quest Store. Bosworth tweeted that when the web version of Horizon Worlds launches, the fee for sales would be 25% because it would avoid the Quest Store’s 30% cut. He noted that this percentage is “a much lower rate compared to other similar world-building platforms.” This means that if you were to purchase a digital item in the web version of Horizon Worlds, the designer you’re buying from would get a larger portion of the sale than if you were to make the same purchase in the VR version. https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1514666741183311872?s=20&t=M8qEzxHNbmtMx9uvv0iKRg “We’re making good on our goal to ensure that developers have a path to real financial success on our platform,” Bosworth said in a tweet. “It’s early days, there is still a lot of work to be done and we continue to partner closely with our creators and developers to enable them to earn meaningful revenue.” Bosworth didn’t say more about the web version of the virtual world or reveal any details about how it would work or when it may be released. The news comes as The Verge reported a few days ago that Meta is also working on a bringing Horizon Worlds to mobile phones later this year. Meta’s plans to launch web and mobile versions of its virtual world could be seen as a way for the company to get more people to join Horizon Worlds by avoiding the need for a Quest VR headset. But, there’s also the question of whether a web and mobile version of the platform would defeat the purpose of Meta’s vision of the metaverse. Considering Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sees the metaverse as a “successor to the mobile internet ,” where you’ll be able to do things you can’t do in the physical world, it’s unclear how a web and mobile version of Horizon Worlds would fit into this vision. Bosworth’s comments come a few days after Meta revealed that it’s testing a feature that will let creators sell virtual items and effects within their worlds. The new feature is rolling out to a small group of creators to start, and marks a significant next step in the company’s mission of building the foundation of virtual reality social networking. All users with access to Horizon Worlds will be able to make these in-world purchases. Meta is also beginning to test a Horizon Worlds Creator Bonus program for participants in the U.S. Horizon Worlds opened up to all users over 18 years old in the U.S. and Canada in December 2021 after the platform was first announced in 2019.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/11/meta-dispo-ftc-case-subpoena/,Meta subpoenaed tiny rival Dispo to prove it isn’t a monopoly,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us On a quest to show the FTC that it isn’t a monopoly, Meta flooded a wide swath of major tech companies with subpoenas last month . But the company is apparently demanding documents from much smaller “rivals” too. Photo-sharing app Dispo received its own subpoena from the company on March 23. In the subpoena, Meta makes 36 separate requests for Dispo’s internal documents, including user metrics on “an hourly and daily basis,” any documentation about who the small company views as its own competition and “all documents sufficient to identify your assessment of the primary reasons why your users use each of your products.” Some, like a request for any user privacy complaints, are even further afield. In a letter to Meta’s counsel early this month, Dispo pushed back, asking the company to withdraw the subpoena. The company argues that many of the demands Meta is making don’t even apply to Dispo, like asking for documentation of its acquisitions, and the requests that do are still “unduly burdensome, overbroad, vexatious and harassing.” “We have 25 employees and no lawyers on staff,” Dispo co-founder and CEO Daniel Liss said in an email to TechCrunch. “Demanding our most sensitive trade secrets is extraneous to the legal question being debated.” Liss, a vocal Meta critic who has authored a series here at TechCrunch analyzing the antitrust case against the company , argues that Dispo was targeted intentionally to bury the small company in paperwork. “With under 30 employees, under $25 millionraised, and under 6 million downloads, Dispo is not a competitor,” Liss said, calling Meta’s subpoena “harassing and intimidating.” Dispo, a photo-sharing app co-founded by YouTube star David Dobrik, first took off in early 2021. Like many hot new photo apps, it was quickly hailed as the next Instagram, climbing the charts and drumming up investor buzz while still in beta. But a month later the company was embroiled in controversy when disturbing sexual assault allegations emerged against a member of Dobrik’s inner circle. As many of Dobrik’s content sponsors backed away, Dispo’s investors did too , and the YouTube celebrity left the company in March. Dispo is just one of at least 90 non-party subpoenas Meta has sent out related to the FTC’s antitrust case , and it’s the smallest company known to receive one so far. On March 22, Snap, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Match Group, Reddit, Twitter and Oracle asked a judge to limit the scope of Meta’s requests to their respective companies and to bar Meta’s in-house legal team from poring over sensitive documents that could further give it a competitive edge. “Meta is casting an extraordinarily wide net for extremely sensitive materials from non-parties,” the coalition of tech companies wrote. The group argued that Meta’s sweeping requests would require them to produce millions of documents — a heavy lift, even for a company with a dedicated legal team. “In addition to being highly burdensome, the subpoenas are also highly invasive. The types of information called for — including the Non-Parties’ pricing, user-acquisition, and competitive strategies — are among the most competitively sensitive documents that Non-Parties possess.” Dispo launches a test to gauge user interest in selling their photos as NFTs Spark Capital decides to ‘sever all ties’ with David Dobrik’s Dispo app weeks after leading deal The FTC is reportedly probing Meta’s VR business for antitrust violations Topics Culture Editor Taylor covered social media, gaming and culture at TechCrunch.

https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/08/pivotal-kicks-off-u-s-sales-of-its-lightweight-electric-personal-aircraft/,Pivotal kicks off US sales of its lightweight electric personal Helix aircraft,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Pivotal, the Palo Alto, California–based company backed by Larry Page, kicked off online sales Monday night at CES 2024 for Helix, a lightweight electric personal aircraft that doesn’t require a pilot’s license to fly. Helix marks an evolution for Pivotal , a company previously known as Opener that has been working on lightweight electric vertical and takeoff aircraft for more than a decade. The company first gained attention for BlackFly, a personal single-seat aircraft with tilt-aircraft architecture that was delivered to the first customer in June 2023. The Helix, revealed in October, reflects the maturity of the company’s tech and is the first one designed to be produced in larger volumes. Deliveries for the Helix, which will be sold only in the United States, begin June 10, 2024. Prospective U.S. buyers need only time for the training and at least $190,000 (before taxes). And Pivotal CEO Ken Karklin says the “market is ready for the wonder of aerial recreation and short-hop eVTOL travel.” And based on the initial reaction, it seems the market is ready. Pivotal COO Kristina Menton told TechCrunch at the event that potential customers were already making reservations (which requires a refundable $250) within the first hour of online sales. The single-seat aircraft doesn’t require Federal Aviation Administration pilot certification. The Helix, due to its lightweight status weighing about 348 pounds, complies with the FAA Part 103 (Ultralight) category in the United States. That doesn’t mean there aren’t some regulations, however. The FAA requires Ultralight aircraft can fly over only noncongested areas and away from airports. Pivotal requires all buyers to go through training. There are a few other requirements for buyers; they must be at least 18 years old, weigh less than 220 pounds and have a maximum standing height of 6 feet 5 inches. And there are some limitations. Owners won’t be able to fly long distances with the Helix, an aircraft with more than 20 miles of range and a charge time of about 75 minutes from 20% to 100% battery using a 240V charger. The Helix is available in three configurations, all of which include required training. The base $190,000 package includes the Helix aircraft with a white-and-carbon fiber exterior finish and a digital flight panel, canopy, HD landing camera, charger, vehicle cart, custom marking and warranty. The second package starts at $240,000 and offers a gloss white-and-striped carbon fiber exterior finish and includes the features above, plus a trailer with dual-wing cart, 4k camera with landing assist, recording and sharing features, an ADS-B air traffic system, two chargers and an enhanced warranty. That trailer, by the way, is how owners might cart there Helix around. Pivotal says the Helix can be assembled in 30 minutes. When disassembled, it can fit into a 16-foot trailer. The third package is priced at $260,000 and offers an exterior in gloss white and carbon fiber with custom accent color and includes the features above, plus a premium flight deck, three chargers, beacon aircraft lighting, integrated emergency locator transmitter, one additional training slot for a friend or family member, and the option to fully customize the exterior at additional cost, design dependent. The Helix aircraft will be manufactured in Palo Alto. Customers can order the Helix online with a $250 nonrefundable application fee. However, to secure the production slot and forecasted ship date, a deposit of $50,000 is due within five business days of initial order placement, according to the company.

But in many ways, the past year should be thought of as the setting of a chess board before a match: the pieces are in place. Now it is time to play. That means that 2022 will be a make it or break it year, at least for those developers who have publicly stated ambitions of hitting commercial operations by 2024. What will next year hold in store, not just for them, but for the sector more broadly? Below are some top predictions and trends to look out for in the coming year. Overall, the sentiment from experts, analysts and VCs we spoke to seemed to be that 2022 will be critical for separating the wheat from the chaff — specifically when it comes to certification of the aircraft with the Federal Aviation Administration, a prerequisite for any company that hopes to get their aircraft off the ground. “The main story of 2022, it’s definitely going to be certification,” Sergio Cecutta, founder and partner at SMG Consulting, said. “It’s the year of put up or shut up.” Due to certification timelines, Cecutta said that companies that want to enter service in 2024 need to start flying with the FAA for certification credit by the end of next year in order to hit that target. David Wyatt, a technology analyst at IDTechEx, agreed. “What I want to see in 2022 is more aircraft in the air,” he said. “To have something that’s certifiable by [2024], they have to start getting substantial aircraft in the air and really demonstrating the capabilities of those aircraft.” “They’re not going to be complete, finished products, but at least a real ramp up in prototyping is what you’d be wanting to see from these companies who have raised the money,” he added. “They need to start demonstrating to investors that they’re capable of building these aircraft and getting them through flight certification.” While many of the biggest players in eVTOL are startups (or startups-turned-public companies, thanks to SPAC deals), they aren’t the only ones looking to take advantage of the potentially huge market for air taxis, drone deliveries or other applications of electric aviation. Hyundai and Honda have not been shy about their eVTOL ambitions, with Hyundai unveiling a concept eVTOL at CES in 2020. At the end of 2021, it announced it had spun out its urban air mobility division into a separate business arm, dubbed Supernal, with the aim of bringing an aircraft to market in 2028. Other automakers, principally Toyota and Stellantis, have already started joining in — in the form of major investments in Joby and a manufacturing deal with Archer, respectively. But we could see other automakers announcing their own eVTOL projects next year, Cyrus Sigari, co-founder and managing partner of UP Partners, said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if we saw a meaningful move from Ford or GM in 2022,” he said. As we detailed in part one of our eVTOL retrospective, 2021 was undoubtedly the year of the SPACs. There was a notable uptake of this financial vehicle, not just in eVTOL but across the electric mobility space. It’s unclear whether this trend will continue into 2022, but the high capital demands of aviation could mean more startups are still looking for a huge injection of cash via the public markets. Amy Burr, president of airline JetBlue’s venture capital arm, said that SPACs may be the best way to raise capital and access public markets for pre-revenue companies like electric aviation developers. “I believe that that’s their only path forward, unless they could just continue to do venture rounds and raise more capital that way, which is always a possibility,” she said. Sigari suggested there’s room for “two more” SPACs next year. “I’d be very surprised if the number is greater than five and I’m pretty sure it’s not going to be zero. This is assuming we don’t have a global financial crisis.” There could be a slight tempering of the public market’s appetite for aviation technology. At the end of November, air taxi developer Volocopter cancelled its SPAC plans due to an “extremely unfavorable” environment for SPACs, a German publication reported . “There’s always potential out there for more SPAC deals, but whether the Volocopter [deal] falling through is a sign of a general cooling of interest towards those kinds of deals, I guess we’ll have to see,” Wyatt said. One thing that most experts we spoke to didn’t mention (or didn’t seem overly concerned with) is consolidation, which has hit other hot tech industries like autonomous vehicles. “With time it’s just inevitable that there will be consolidation and there will be companies that might not make it,” Cecutta said. That omission suggests, at least to us, that perhaps the industry has not yet reached the apex of the hype cycle for emerging technologies — which suggests that despite the crazy cash flow and growing fanfare, there may still be a rocky road ahead.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/15/aptos-labs-a16z-multicoin-facebook-diem-blockchain/,"Ex-Meta employees raise $200M from a16z, Tiger, Multicoin to realize Facebook’s crypto dreams",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Facebook’s audacious attempt at creating a crypto payments network met an unceremonious end earlier this year when Silvergate Capital acquired the Diem technology assets for $182 million . The deal showcased how Facebook, now Meta, is left with few regulator-blessed paths forward to become a central player in the blockchain ecosystem, a realization which has also cost the company plenty of talent, including crypto boss David Marcus . Some ex-Meta employees are beginning to take up the mantle of the open source Diem blockchain in an effort to realize the vision of a decentralized network that they say is built to serve billions of users and is designed to cater to large corporate customers early-on. One such effort, called Aptos — led by ex-Meta employees who only departed the company in December — has already banked unicorn funding from Andreessen Horowitz and scores of other top web3 investors. “We are the original creators, researchers, designers, and builders of Diem, the blockchain that was first built to serve this purpose. While the world never got to see what we built, our work is far from over,” Aptos CEO Mo Shaikh wrote in a blog post last month. Facebook ditches Diem stablecoin with asset sale to Silvergate The startup tells TechCrunch that it has closed a $200 million “strategic” investment led by a16z, with participation from Tiger Global, Katie Haun, Multicoin Capital, 3 Arrows Capital, FTX Ventures and Coinbase Ventures among others. Another investor of note in the maiden round is Silvergate Capital, though the Aptos team swears they will not be licensing or utilizing any of the Diem IP that Silvergate owns as they build out their blockchain. The founders did not disclose the valuation, but said they were “well off into the unicorn territory.” (The equity valuation of the round is $1 billion, according to an investor memo obtained by TechCrunch, but after taking into account the tokens, it’s considerably more than that. The Aptos team declined to share the exact figures.) The Aptos blockchain will be a so-called Layer 1 system, meaning it will not be designed to sit on top of existing blockchains like Ethereum or Solana and will instead build out its own decentralized network. Alongside the company’s funding news, Aptos also shared that it has formally launched its “devnet,” which will allow developers to experiment and build on the Aptos blockchain ahead of a public release, which the team hopes will happen sometime in Q3. The Aptos team said a number of companies, including Anchorage, Binance, Coinbase, Livepeer, Moonclave, Paxos, Paymagic, Rarible and Streaming Fast, are already engaging with the startup, providing feedback and contributing code on devnet. Aptos is aiming to build a more scalable blockchain with faster transactions and lower fees than today’s mainstream networks allow. The founders’ hope is that they can design a network that is more reliable and predictable for large clients interested in embracing the blockchain. There are only so many ways to scale blockchains. Proponents of Ethereum and its scaling solutions, for instance, are betting on using rollups and sharding — techniques that break blockchains into smaller pieces and then re-connects them — for scaling. But some other players believe there’s a better approach to tackle this challenge. “Current blockchains are just not as reliable as existing financial rails, we’ve seen issues of downtime and outages that last for hours,” said Aptos CTO Avery Ching in an interview with TechCrunch. Kyle Samani, managing partner of Multicoin Capital, a venture capital firm known for being an early backer of several blockchains including Solana, argues that the aforementioned approach increases latency, technical complexity for developers, makes cross-chain apps “inherently fragile” and breaks composability. “The crypto industry frames this debate in a relatively binary way. But there is nuance. These approaches are not mutually exclusive. While most in the industry have traditionally argued in favor of breaking up the state into many pieces, we have argued in favor of optimizing a single-shard performance to optimize UX, DX, and maximize the design space for composable crypto apps. That conviction led us to triple down on Solana through 2019 and 2020, and hold through a meteoric rise in 2021,” he wrote in a blog post While Diem believers like Andreessen Horowitz may rally around a team trying to pick up the mantle of what Facebook was trying to build with Diem and Libra, others in the crypto world are more skeptical about realizing a vision of web3 originally conceived by Facebook. “To be clear, we have no formal relationship with Facebook and no investment from them,” Shaikh told TechCrunch in an interview. “We’re certainly excited about a shared vision for the web3 world. A good thing about us being external is that we can focus on everyone now, we don’t have to just focus on Meta. Our goal is to work with some of the world’s largest brands and tech companies to really build a web3 ecosystem for the masses.” Another challenge/opportunity lying ahead of Aptos is just how quickly it is able to attract developers. The firm is hoping to win developers in part with the use of Move, an open source programming language developed by Meta. “Move is designed for safe resource management, it’s deterministic and metered,” said Ching, noting that the language is suited for strict auditing and verification processes. “Second, our team has developed the lowest latency optimistically responsive Byzantine Fault Tolerance protocol that we have done extensive testing and auditing on for many years. We are actually on the fourth iteration of this protocol and we have pushed upgrades to the protocol,” he said, claiming that on private net testing over the years, the protocol has had no downtime. In a statement to TechCrunch, Multicoin Capital’s Samani added: “The Move programming language has been thoroughly battle tested and is a great environment for building safe, production-grade contracts capable of serving billions of people. We fully expect Aptos to hit the ground running and to immediately become a viable contender in the battle for Layer 1.” To make things more enticing for developers, Aptos is considering different paths for their Ethereum and Solidity support on its network. “I have a very close relationship with the Ethereum community. It’s clear that it’s a multi-chained world: people have built bridges, solutions that are either solving for scalability or are able to from one L1 to another in the pursuit for the larger markets,” said Shaikh, who previously headed strategic partnerships for Meta’s wallet Novi. “We want to be part of that ecosystem. We’re not here to necessarily compete. We want to complement [them] and the challenges [the community faces] — whether it’s something like the wormhole event that took place — give us clear indication that things have to be built responsibly from the ground up,” Shaikh added. “Feedback that we’ve heard from Solidity and Ethereum developers is that they are running up against limitations, they are running up against challenges where you have to spend hours on auditing your smart contracts. There’s only so much capacity that smart contract auditors have today. Those things continue to become pain points. They are looking for other L1s to build on top of natively rather than just porting over assets or going through bridges because that often compromises security.” Facebook announces Libra cryptocurrency: All you need to know Topics Lucas Matney was a senior editor at TechCrunch based in San Francisco.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/04/google-microsoft-sales-pause-russia/,"Google pauses its ad sales in Russia, Microsoft pauses sales",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us In further responses from the tech industry to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last week and the country’s continued aggression against its neighbor, Google and Microsoft have both now said they’re pausing sales in Russia. We understand that Google’s pause — which is focused on its own ad sales — began last night and has been rolling out over subsequent hours. The news was reported earlier by Reuters . It’s not the first to do this. Snap and Twitter previously announced ad sales suspensions in Russia. But Google’s ad business is of course considerably larger. Google’s action boils down to a pause on all ads in Russia, including Search, YouTube and Display ads, effective immediately — meaning people in Russia won’t see ads from Google. But we also understand that it does not prevent Russian advertisers from using Google’s ads services to serve ads outside Russia if they wish. This suggests Russian publications could still seek to monetize content by serving ads to people outside the country via Google’s ad network — at a time when independent journalists in the country are facing an unprecedented crackdown. (Earlier today the Russian parliament passed a law that could land reporters in jail for up to 15 years for spreading “false” information about the military.) Airbnb suspends all operations in Russia and Belarus Microsoft, meanwhile, has also announced its own sales suspension in Russia — writing in a blog post today that it will “suspend all new sales of Microsoft products and services in Russia”. This presumably covers Bing ads, as well as other Microsoft services. (We’ve asked for confirmation.) “In addition, we are coordinating closely and working in lockstep with the governments of the United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom, and we are stopping many aspects of our business in Russia in compliance with governmental sanctions decisions,” Microsoft’s president and VP Brad Smith also writes in the blog post. Google’s more limited move restricting ad sales is an expansion of measures it announced Tuesday — “promoting information quality”, as it put it then — several days after Russia’s invasion began in the early hours of February 24; and after European leaders had spent a day piling pressure on tech platforms to act decisively against Russian disinformation. Initially, Google said it would geoblock the YouTube channels of the Kremlin-linked media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik in Europe. It soon followed by geoblocking the pair’s apps from its Play Store — also only in Europe, and ahead of a pan-EU sanction on the channels coming into legal force on Wednesday Prior to that Google had announced an “indefinite pause of monetization of Russian state-funded media across our platforms” — meaning media outlets such as RT are unable to generate ad revenue or buy advertising via its platforms. But the tech giant confirmed today it’s taken things further by freezing its ad sales in Russia. In a statement on the ad sales suspension, a Google spokesperson told us: In light of the extraordinary circumstances, we’re pausing Google ads in Russia. The situation is evolving quickly, and we will continue to share updates when appropriate. Google is not suspending sales of other types of services (e.g. paid consumer services, Google Pay, sales of apps, etc.) at this time. It is also continuing to provide Russians with access to information services (e.g. Google Search, Maps, YouTube, etc.). The piecemeal nature of the tech giant’s announcements since Russia invaded Ukraine suggests Google has been scrambling to come up with a coherent response to an unfolding crisis. Microsoft has looked more decisive — announcing a more rounded package of measures targeted at Russia’s “state-sponsored disinformation” at the start of this week; and further extending that today with a blanket sales ban. Earlier this week Apple also said it was halting product sales in Russia and restricting some of its services (such as Apple Pay). Plus it pulled RT and Sputnik from the App Store globally this week (with the exception of the Russia market itself). The picture from Facebook’s parent Meta is fuzzier. Since the invasion began the social media giant has been announcing a series of restrictions (such as demoting RT and Sputnik content) — but at the time of writing, the adtech giant does not appear to have suspended ad sales in Russia itself. (Again, we’ve reached out with questions.) Update: A Meta spokesperson sent this statement after it confirmed Russia is blocking its service : “Despite the Russian government’s announcement that they will be blocking Facebook , we are working to keep our services available to the greatest extent possible. However, due to the difficulties of operating in Russia at this time, ads targeting people in Russia will be paused, and advertisers within Russia will no longer be able to create or run ads anywhere in the world, including within Russia.” Bans by private companies are not the only disruption Russians are facing to accessing digital services, of course: Wider sanctions on Russian banks also appear to have been hitting locals’ access to some tech services.

The company will begin downranking posts from Russian state-affiliated media, placing any stories from those outlets below other content from other sources. Users who go to share stories originating with any of these accounts will now see a pop-up message cautioning them against spreading “Russia state-controlled media.” “Instagram believes the account that created this post may be partially or wholly under the editorial control of the Russian government,” the message reads. Users who share stories with link stickers pointing to domains associated with Russian state media will get the same treatment. Content from Russian state-linked accounts will also no longer appear in Instagram’s algorithmically populated discovery areas, like Reels and the discovery tab, and Instagram says that it also won’t show up as readily in search either. Instagram’s efforts to stem the flow of state-backed disinformation about the Russian invasion of Ukraine follows Facebook’s own parallel efforts. Facebook announced last week that it would similarly attempt to bury Russian state media through the use of warning labels and downranking . At the time, Meta Head of Security Policy Nathaniel Gleicher said the labels were on the way “in the days ahead.” Facebook and Instagram cut the reach of Russian state media Instagram is also adding a new privacy measure for some users based in Ukraine and Russia. Now, private accounts based in those countries will have their following and follower lists private and their mutual friend lists hidden, adding a layer of protection that obscures real-life social connections.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/15/scooter-startup-superpedestrian-shutting-down-us-operations-explores-sale-of-europe-business/,"Scooter startup Superpedestrian shutting down US operations, exploring sale of Europe business",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Superpedestrian, the e-scooter startup known for its self-diagnostic software, is shutting down its U.S.-based shared scooter operation on December 31 and exploring a sale of its European business, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The company’s director of U.S. operations, Alexander Berg, confirmed the news to his team Friday afternoon on a Zoom call. Berg said the reason for the shutdown was financial, but did not go into further detail. “Even our investors have put in money to keep us afloat even to this point,” he said on the call. “It wasn’t for lack of trying.” The shutdown comes just 18 months since the startup raised $125 million in a Series C round of equity and debt financing that included investors Jefferies, Antara Capital, the Sony Innovation Fund by IGV and FM Capital alongside existing backers like Spark Capital, General Catalyst and Citi via the Citi Impact Fund. It appears Jeffries and Antara were two of the investors who helped try to keep the company afloat, as Superpedestrian assigned patents to each as collateral for loans of undisclosed amounts in July and October , respectively, according to documents filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office. The e-scooter industry has been in a somewhat rocky place since then, though. Bird’s valuation crashed after it went public, leading to the company pulling out of multiple markets. Superpedestrian itself has gone through a series of layoffs, including one just months after closing its Series C round. The latest, per a posting on LinkedIn, occurred earlier this month. On the call, Berg said Superpedestrian will run “minimal staff” while pulling scooters across the country back into warehouses over the next two weeks. Vanessa Carmack, Superpedestrian’s senior director of human resources for the U.S., who said she had been through layoffs at prior companies, told workers during the Zoom call that the experience was “frustrating” and said she felt “kind of kept out of the loop.” CEO Assaf Biderman held a short call with some employees earlier Friday initially announcing the decision. Biderman did not immediately respond to a voicemail and an emailed request for comment. Superpedestrian has said its scooters are in operation in 60-plus cities across 11 countries, though it pulled out of Chicago in September citing competitive difficulties. A representative from the city of Waco, Texas, where Superpedestrian recently spun up a scooter fleet, said in a phone call Friday that she was not aware of an impending shutdown. The startup used technology, and specifically diagnostic and safety software, to differentiate it from rivals like Bird and Tier. The company boosted its tech efforts by acquiring Navmatic in July 2021. It leveraged Navmatic’s technology to develop and then roll out a so-called pedestrian defense safety system , a feature designed to detect and correct unsafe riding behaviors, like riding on sidewalks, in real time. Superpedestrian had planned to build and roll out new scooters equipped with its branded Pedestrian Defense to 25 cities across the United States and Europe in 2022. The initial deployments were supposed to begin in the U.S. and the United Kingdom in pedestrian-dense cities by early spring, according to the company.

https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/armageddon-now-nasas-asteroid-deflecting-dart-mission-launches-tonight/,‘Armageddon’ now: NASA’s asteroid-deflecting DART mission launches tonight,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Update : Successful launch and NASA has acquired DART’s signal. One of NASA’s most exciting and unusual missions in years, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) , is scheduled to launch tonight on its way to strike and deflect an incoming space rock millions of miles from Earth. You can watch it live here, though it’ll be some time before the big smash happens. DART is our first attempt as a spacefaring species to deliberately change the path of an oncoming asteroid. Rest assured, this one in particular is no danger to our precious planet, but does happen to be a perfect test bed for the type of interception that might be necessary should such a danger appear. “Planetary Defense has been working on the problem for, really, decades,” explained Thomas Zurbuchen, head of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. “It’s time to start getting together this toolset — it’s getting important for all our stakeholders. It’s really been in the last five years or so that the program has increased its support. And the target has been around for at least five years before that — people were talking about how this is really perfect, we can view its success from the ground, there’s no need for a second investigation.” The asteroid in question is actually the smaller of two in a binary configuration, traveling like a married couple through the solar system. The larger asteroid, Didymos, is about half a mile wide — not quite a planet-killer, but you wouldn’t want it coming down in your neighborhood either. And around it orbits our target: Dimorphos, about 525 feet across and sort of peanut-shaped, it’s about the size the Statue of Liberty would go bouldering on. What DART will do is fly right out there and, just when Dimorphos is coming around from the far side of Didymos, smash into it as hard as possible — and that’s quite hard, considering that the spacecraft will weigh about 1,210 pounds and its new ion engine will have propelled it to the eye-watering (if it had eyes, and there was air) speed of 4.1 miles per second. (That’s 550 kilograms at 6.6 km/s for our metric friends; I leave it to the boffins to calculate the approximate impact force.) Dimorphos won’t explode and send fragments flying everywhere. Quite the opposite: the effect will be barely noticeable. But the impact will ever so slightly affect the period of its orbit around Didymos, slowing and expanding it to the point where a powerful telescope can perceive it. By observing this change scientists should be able to tell the mass of the object and how effective this refined technique of hitting a heavy thing with another thing actually was. Once they know that, they can make an informed decision on what might be necessary if, for instance, an asteroid twice as large was in fact on a collision course. By applying this much force at angle, at time and distance (as far out as possible, one member of the team told me), we can divert it just enough that it won’t hit us. DART will be foundational to this sort of planetary defense work. Hopefully we won’t ever need it, but we can all agree it’s better to be prepared than have to muster a ragtag group of oil rig roughnecks to nuke the Big One at the last minute. That’s another “Armageddon” reference to keep our valued older readership engaged. “What we’d really like to do with this is, we need to know how to size an impactor depending on the size of the threat coming in. We want an impactor model with a high degree of accuracy,” said Zurbuchen. One such mission may not be enough, and though there are no plans for another impact mission yet, “I could easily imagine that a follow-up test into a different asteroid type could be on the books.” Of course, though the impact may be relatively small, it will still be cool. So we’re sending up a partner spacecraft, LICIACube, that will watch from nearby, providing both data and crowd-pleasing footage of our attack on space mountain. Chances are it will just look like a puff of dust, gravel and solar panel parts, but you never know. This might be the asteroid with something living in it. If so, it will still be about 6.8 million miles away, so we won’t be in immediate danger. At any rate it’s hard to imagine ramming an asteroid with a spacecraft and not getting it on camera. “It’s a high risk, high impact investigation,” Zurbuchen said of the companion CubeSat, which will have to be perfectly positioned and watching closely at the time of impact. “We can be sure it worked without it, but… I want to see that movie, man.” The launch window for DART, aboard its SpaceX Falcon 9 vehicle, begins tonight at about 10:20 PM Pacific, and the weather at Vandenberg Space Force Base is looking 90% favorable in the latest reports. Once it’s out there it will be nearly a year before the spacecraft makes its destructive rendezvous with Dimorphos: impact is estimated to take place at the end of September 2022, though we’ll only know the exact time once the variables are locked down.

This is the first time that Blue Origin is flying a full complement of six passengers on its New Shepard reusable rocket and capsule, and the group going on this trip includes Good Morning America co-host Michael Strahan; rocket namesake Alan Shepard’s daughter Laura Shepard Churchley; Voyager Space CEO Dylan Taylor; Dick Holdings managing member Evan Dick; and father and child pair Lane Bess and Cameron Bess. In keeping with Blue Origin’s penchant for notching historic firsts with its human spaceflight missions, this will be the first time a parent and child make the trip to space together. Lane Bess, the principal and founder of Bess Ventures, will be accompanied by Cameron Bess, a content creator and software developer. This will be Blue Origin’s third human spaceflight, and also the third this year. New Shepard previously flew two crews of four people each, first with a manifest that included Blue Origin and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , and then just in October it sent up William Shatner, along with Blue Origin’s Audrey Powers, DCVC partner Chris Boshuizen and Medidata co-founder Glen de Vries, who tragically passed away in an airplane accident just weeks later. The pace that Blue Origin is hitting with these launches is impressive, especially given the likely price tags for each ticket. With six-person flights, the company is likely improving its margins, which may lead to slightly more affordable seats for those going up, but it’s still bound to be an extreme luxury. Blue Origin’s New Shepard flies its passengers to the edge of space, staying sub-orbital but providing them with a few minutes of weightlessness and unparalleled views of Earth, before the capsule returns slowed by parachutes to a landing in the West Texas desert.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/08/to-save-independent-journalism-media-must-embrace-web3-innovation/,"To save independent journalism, media must embrace web3 innovation",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us As the innovation budgets for Big Tech platforms and content giants like Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, Disney and Netflix have soared amid the ascent of web3 and metaverse, news media is currently hibernating when it comes to innovation. This leads us to a critical question: Is journalistic news media missing a huge opportunity in having a concrete role in shaping emerging digital ecosystems? Do news media organizations choose to optimize for the short-term (again) at the expense of long-term success? Has the pace of innovation really slowed down or even come to a halt? Three revealing exhibits: First, the Oxford Reuters Institute’s recent trend report points out that news media organizations around the world are now focusing on tinkering and optimizing instead of making big bets on innovation or R&D. As the study reveals, most news media organizations aren’t actively focusing on experimenting with new technologies or launching new products for emerging platforms. Podcasts, newsletters and video, that’s all folks – for 2022, at least. Second, the biggest public splash in news media innovation was recently made by “the Smiths” – Ben Smith of The New York Times and formerly BuzzFeed News, and Justin Smith, the CEO of Bloomberg Media. They aim to build a global newsroom that will experiment with “new formats of storytelling.” Anita Zielina and Isabelle Roughol provided great analysis on the challenges of the target market and the need for the “globally literate media.” And Clare Malone tried to get a whiff of the new product itself. All in all, the Smiths’ intentions were widely commented on, but their concrete thoughts on innovation were thin. Third, misinformation is spreading in social media platforms, continuously weakening trust in established legacy institutions. For too many, the last U.S. presidential election is still stolen. For a great number of people, COVID is a non-issue shrouded in conspiracy theories. Democracy itself is at risk when people don’t share the same baseline reality, and news media hasn’t been able to change this development. Fact-checking innovations, despite their importance, don’t help at scale when people can’t agree on what constitutes a fact in the first place. In short, when the rest of the digital ecosystem is moving very quickly, news media is bound to fail if it can’t keep up. There’s been a lot of talk about journalism and artificial intelligence (AI). Importantly, news organizations have been concretely working on a wide variety of AI solutions , from content recommendation and moderation to advanced analytics, deep-fake detection and optimizing subscription pipelines. But have we seen anything truly disruptive and transformative yet? Something that will really move the needle for news organizations in the longer run, giving them a business advantage in the digital information ecosystem? Adoption of AI technologies is still slow in the field partly due to the high cost of development. Additionally, news media needs more use cases and business cases for AI that have been born out of pure journalistic thinking and need. What about web3 and metaverse, and their combination? So far, news organizations haven’t actively explored or developed solutions for these emerging digital ecosystems. Yes, there is a lot of hype and misconception related to both, but it doesn’t mean that web3 and metaverse won’t become “the next big thing.” In fact, there exists a great window of opportunity for news organizations. As both web3 and the metaverse — as concepts and as technological stacks — are still in flux, news media can actually affect how they are shaped now and in the future. News media should participate actively in the conversation and development of web3 and metaverse as soon as possible with concrete ideas and solutions. News media should start collaborating with people in this space and leverage all the concrete lessons from AI and machine learning in taking an active role in this new frontier. Below are some ideas for the future iteration: It’s still all around articles, more or less. Yes, podcasts are now the gold standard for news innovation. Real-time live feeds have been reinvented for some news sites (after giving real-time away to Twitter, for example). But what does creating content mean and look like in the web3 era or in the metaverse? What’s the look and feel for next-generation news media content in these environments? In content creation, some of the basic building blocks need to be rethought. What’s the news media’s content creation process (or content management system) for metaverse? Can NFT-type thinking and blockchain technologies be embedded in visualized storytelling or collaborative creation of news content? I’ve written before about personalized news media content. There’s already been interesting experimentation with the help of AI around modular journalistic content and news summarization that could provide new tools for content personalization. At the same time, it’s in the best interest of news media organizations to figure out how trustworthy content is created in web3 (and metaverse) environments. Can trust and trustworthiness be coded into the very content and their representations? Web3 technologies offer new possibilities for creating exclusive personalized content experiences, but they might also offer new tools for content verification and fact-checking. For example, the trustworthiness and credibility of given news content could be evaluated through transparent and traceable analysis, using already verified and trusted information stored in the blockchain. Content verification would become an open-sourced and decentralized process rather than depending on a single authority. In the process, the facts constituting the baseline reality would be checked and, if needed, iterated collectively. In the field of news media, the adoption of personalized content recommendations has been slow and uneven. Today, content recommendation should be a basic feature, not a spearhead of the current innovation efforts. Again, there are crucial questions to be explored and answered in rethinking distribution for news media. What is the interface for news in a digital ecosystem that’s not tied into the rectangular thing you carry around in your pocket? (Tip: Voice interface doesn’t count as an answer here.) With web3 solutions, people can have (and might be able to create) their own interfaces for news. Personalization gets a new dimension when the agency is transferred to users. Also, social graphs, relevance graphs and interest graphs are owned by the current tech giants and used to personalize user interfaces such as news feeds, video streams or search results. What if news media focused on impact in personalization? In the age of climate change and a global healthcare crisis, news media could offer a personalized view to information based on impact graphs instead of interest or social graphs. News content would be weighted and ranked based on its impact on different areas of life. Web3 ecosystems could even be used to make the impact analysis and ranking community-driven. Thus, news could be recommended and prioritized based on the impact on the things the user considers valuable, or things that might have a direct effect on the user. If you’re interested in following news affecting climate change or healthcare, for example, news about things and events that have a greater impact on climate change or healthcare would be prioritized in recommendations. Until today, the main question for news media has been: Are we in the ad business or subscription business? In the wake of web3 and metaverse, the question is: Who is actively looking into new business opportunities in these emerging ecosystems? Web3 is likely to change the content and data ownership. What are the marketplaces for trustworthy news experiences in a potentially more decentralized digital ecosystem? What if people could invest in news content or news media organizations through DAOs, or as individuals using blockchain? Also, can the monetization be somehow rethought: Could there be transactions based on impact? The higher the impact on you or your personally selected interest area, the higher the purchase price for the news content. Of course, web3 or metaverse aren’t guaranteed bets , nor do they offer any silver bullets for the business of journalistic news media. However, they both represent a recognized path for technological development that will have a significant impact on our cultural, social, economic and political realities. Innovation doesn’t need to mean one-off showcases with bells and whistles, but long-term strategic investment in future methods, technologies and ecosystems. The mission of independent news media should guide all new innovations and their prioritization. I strongly suggest that independent news media start injecting their mission, values and business cases in exploring and creating new, concrete solutions for web3 and metaverse.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/28/instagram-is-shutting-down-its-standalone-igtv-app/,Instagram is shutting down its standalone IGTV app,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Instagram is ending support for its standalone app for IGTV, the company announced on Monday. Meta, Instagram’s parent company, confirmed to TechCrunch that the app will be removed from app stores in mid-March. In a blog post , the company explained that the change is part of its efforts to make video as simple as possible to discover and create. Instagram says it will now focus on having all video on its main app and that it will continue to simplify and improve video in the main Instagram app over the coming months. Today’s announcement comes as Instagram ditched its IGTV branding last October when it combined IGTV’s long-form video and Instagram feed videos into a new format called simply “Instagram Video.” At the time, Instagram had said the IGTV app wouldn’t be going away and would instead be rebranded. The company also announced today that in-stream video ads, previously known as IGTV ads, will no longer be supported as it shifts its focus to Reels. Instagram says creators who are actively monetizing with in-stream video ads will receive a temporary monthly payment based on recent earnings. Although this seems like a step back in terms of creator monetization, Instagram revealed that it’s exploring more ways for users to earn revenue. Later this year, the company will begin testing a new ad experience on Instagram, which will allow users to earn revenue from ads displayed on their Reels. The new monetization option will join the Reels bonus program , which offers creators opportunities to earn money each month. As part of today’s announcements, Instagram reiterated its focus on Reels, its short-form video TikTok rival. The company notes that Reels continue to be the largest contributor to engagement growth on the app and that it plans to continue to invest in the feature. “Video is a huge part of why people enjoy Instagram, and we love how our creator community uses it to express themselves, collaborate with others, and connect with their followers,” the company said in the blog post. “Reels continues to be a growing and important part of Instagram and we are excited to invest even more in this format.” The decision to shut down IGTV’s standalone app was already losing ground as a standalone product. In early 2020, Instagram dropped the orange IGTV button from Instagram’s home page due to lack of traction. The move came at a time when, at most, just 7 million of Instagram’s 1-billion-plus users had downloaded the standalone IGTV app, TechCrunch previously reported, citing Sensor Tower research.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/09/microsoft-activision-blizzard-call-of-duty-deal/,Microsoft says it will open up the Xbox store in light of the Activision Blizzard deal,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Microsoft is working to warm lawmakers up to its plans to bring a collection of the world’s most popular video games under its wing. The company announced its intention to buy Activision Blizzard last month in a deal that would be worth $68.7 billion — the largest gaming acquisition of all time, if the deal goes through. The acquisition isn’t exactly ill-fated, but it’s a risky time for Microsoft to attract attention from regulators. In the U.S., lawmakers and regulatory agencies have largely focused on some of the tech giant’s peers, particularly Meta (formerly Facebook), Google, Apple and Amazon. Microsoft’s name doesn’t come up in contentious conversations about social networks, advertising or online marketplaces, so the massive company has managed to mostly fly under the radar in recent years in spite of its size. With the Activision Blizzard deal on the table, that’s unlikely to last. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that the proposed acquisition will be reviewed by the FTC, an agency now chaired by Lina Khan, an antitrust scholar keen to disrupt escalating consolidation in the tech industry. Microsoft President Brad Smith addressed regulators directly in a new blog post Wednesday , striking a cooperative tone and outlining a set of “Open App Store Principles” that the company will adopt in light of proposed regulation and its own plans to buy a cluster of the world’s most popular gaming titles. Microsoft framed the new ideology as a preemptive effort to accommodate regulatory changes, but it’s also clearly an appeal to the federal government to sign off on the acquisition: … We recognize that the emerging new era of tech regulation brings with it both benefits and risks, not just for a single company but for our entire industry. As others have pointed out, there are risks with any new regulation, and these deserve a fair hearing and thorough consideration. But as a company, we continue to be more focused on adapting to regulation than fighting against it. In part this is because we have been adapting for two decades to antitrust rules, and we’ve learned from our experience. While change is not easy, we believe it’s possible to adapt to new rules and innovate successfully. The principles Smith lays out here touch on a handful of issues of interest to regulators, including a promise to not leverage app store data to compete against developers and a commitment against self-preferencing. The company also committed to not forcing developers to use its payments system or disallowing them from communicating with customers about better deals to be had on other platforms. Microsoft says that the set of open principles is adapted from guidelines it created for Windows, but it plans to institute them for the Xbox “beginning today.” Notably, the company stops short of making those promises for the key bits about opening up payments in the Xbox store, though claims it will work to “close the gap” by implementing the remaining principles in the future: We will not require developers in our app store to use our payment system to process in-app payments. We will not require developers in our app store to provide more favorable terms in our app store than in other app stores. We will not disadvantage developers if they choose to use a payment processing system other than ours or if they offer different terms and conditions in other app stores. We will not prevent developers from communicating directly with their customers through their apps for legitimate business purposes, such as pricing terms and product or service offerings. Smith also addressed some specific concerns around the deal directly. He confirmed that if the deal goes through, Call of Duty will still be available through Sony’s PlayStation “beyond the existing agreement and into the future” so Sony console owners won’t be left out in the cold. “We are also interested in taking similar steps to support Nintendo’s successful platform,” Smith wrote. “We believe this is the right thing for the industry, for gamers and for our business.” Smith notes that “other popular Activision Blizzard titles” will also get the same treatment rather than immediately becoming Microsoft exclusives. Beyond Call of Duty, the Activision Blizzard deal includes a deep roster of hit games like Overwatch, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Starcraft, Hearthstone and Candy Crush. It’s hard to imagine that Microsoft wouldn’t leverage the massive deal to draw gamers toward the Xbox side of the gaming equation, but the console wars aren’t as relevant as they used to be — at least, not in the way that we’re used to thinking about them. During the Epic v. Apple trial, Microsoft admitted that the company subsidizes hardware sales and doesn’t make a profit off of Xbox consoles . Game sales and game subscription services are how console makers actually make money, but hardware isn’t totally irrelevant: Much like the app model, gaming is all about getting customers into your software store and keeping them there. Making hardware people want to buy is one of the main ways to pull that off. If customers are playing your game on someone else’s console, your competitor can take a cut of that cash — the standard 30% — but you’re still making money. For Microsoft, deciding how open its gaming ecosystem should remain is all about doing that math and balancing it against the expanded customer base it’ll maintain if hit titles — particularly those with subscriptions and in-game purchases — remain playable across platforms. Smith acknowledged this reality explicitly in the blog post, noting that app stores are both the future and present of the game industry. “Just as Windows has evolved to an open and broadly used platform, we see the future of gaming following a similar path,” Smith wrote. “… Our vision is to enable gamers to play any game on any device anywhere, including by streaming from the cloud.” Of course, the way app stores work right now is subject to change. One antitrust bill wending its way through Congress, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act , would explicitly prevent companies from self-preferencing and putting competitors at a disadvantage on their platforms. Another bill, the Open App Markets Act , would similarly tear down the walled gardens that software platforms have been tending for the last decade. Both bills made it out of committee in the last month and are likely looming large for companies like Microsoft, even if gaming platforms won’t be subject to all of the changes that could sweep over the App Store and other software marketplaces. “We want to enable world-class content to reach every gamer more easily across every platform,” Smith wrote. “We want to encourage more innovation and investment in content creation and fewer constraints on distribution. Put simply, the world needs open app markets, and this requires open app stores.” A new Senate bill would totally upend Apple and Google’s app store dominance The first big tech antitrust bill lumbers toward reality Topics Culture Editor Taylor covered social media, gaming and culture at TechCrunch.

The news comes less than a month after Lucid debuted its luxury Gravity SUV , and mere days after Nasdaq said it will bump the firm from the Nasdaq-100 index (alongside eBay and Zoom). Lucid’s stock ended regular trading down by about 2.5%, at $4.61 per share. The stock sank by more than 3% during after-hours trading, to around $4.47 per share. House’s departure is “effective immediately,” Lucid wrote in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company didn’t say much else regarding the cause for the leadership change, except that the decision was apparently “not the result of any disagreement.” Lucid added that accounting executive Gagan Dhingra will step up as interim CFO. For their trouble, the outgoing and rising execs will receive the kind of money you’d need to afford a Lucid SUV — given its expected $80,000 price tag . House joined Lucid in May 2021, after spending close to four years at Waymo, per LinkedIn . The executive will leave with severance, a $215,000 bonus, accelerated stock vesting and a company vehicle. Dhingra joined Lucid in December 2021 and previously led accounting at financial software developer Anaplan . With the new interim role, Lucid said it’ll grant Dhingra $500,000 in stock as well as bonuses and a $25,000 monthly stipend.

On December 14-15, some of this planet’s foremost experts will be in the house to talk about lunar samples and why they’re critical to determining whether humans can live on other planets. Lunar samples, in the form of rocks, regolith or dust, offer greater insight to the origins not only of the moon itself, but also of our planet and the inner solar system. In 2020, rock samples collected by China’s Chang’e-5 (the first expedition to do so in more than 40 years) proved that lava flowed on the moon’s surface a relatively mere 2 billion years ago — when multicellular life began to evolve on Earth. These substances have also been researched in the creation of lunar energy-storage regolith bricks, which could enable lunar construction and potential eventual habitation. Extraterrestrial resource collection isn’t just for government agencies anymore. Instead, it will require collaboration among government, private and public entities. NASA hopes to return humans to the moon by 2024 and, as part of that effort, it’s accepting proposals from commercial companies to collect samples of rocks and substances from any lunar location. Compared to samples collected in the 1970s, today’s advanced analytical capabilities will provide deeper understanding and exciting possibilities At , we’ll have a panel discussion with lunar expedition experts from iSpace, Masten Space Systems and Lockheed Martin Space to discuss recent lunar sample research and explore what the future of lunar sampling looks like. That’s just one example of the stellar speakers we have on tap at TC Sessions: Space.

https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/spaceflight-aims-to-send-customer-payloads-to-two-separate-orbits-for-the-first-time/,Spaceflight aims to send customer payloads to two separate orbits for the first time,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Launch services provider Spaceflight Inc. said Tuesday it will deploy customer spacecraft to two distinct orbits for the first time, as the company seeks to expand the capabilities of its Sherpa line of orbital transfer vehicles. Orbital transfer vehicles (OTV) have become a popular way for satellites to reach their final destinations in orbit, allowing smaller space companies to forego the cost and mass of having their own propulsion system while also splitting the cost of an OTV — similar to how SpaceX lets companies split the cost of launch under its rideshare mission program. Seattle-based Spaceflight aims to execute the maneuver using a new type of Sherpa space tug outfitted with a chemical propulsion system. It is calling the new vehicle the Sherpa-LTC1, and it marks the third type of Sherpa OTV that the company has debuted in the last 12 months. Spaceflight also developed a Sherpa tug equipped with an electric propulsion system, which it calls the Sherpa-LTE, that flew on the SpaceX Transporter-2 mission in June, and a Sherpa-LT it debuted in 2020. Sherpa-LTC1 will head to space next year, aboard the SpaceX Transporter 3 launch that’s scheduled to depart from Florida’s Cape Canaveral in January. The space tug will put a collective 13 customer spacecraft into two separate orbits. First, the Sherpa OTV will deploy nine smallsat payloads before maneuvering to a lower altitude to deploy the remaining four CubeSats. Customers for the mission include Capella Space, Umbra Space, Lynk Global, Inc., Kleos Space, NASA, Czech Aerospace Research Centre in partnership with Spacemanic, Space Products and Innovation (SPiN) and Portland State Aerospace Society. The new space tug uses a “green” propulsion system developed by Benchmark Space Systems, which the company says will enable rapid orbital transfer for many different sized spacecrafts. According to Grant Bonin, SVP of business development at Spaceflight, “maneuvers in LEO are just the beginning. These capabilities and services will play a crucial role in accessing other orbits beyond LEO and developing in-space transportation and various mission services.” In September, Spaceflight announced it would debut yet another Sherpa vehicle, the Sherpa-ES, on a lunar flyby mission next year.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/24/apple-extends-an-in-app-purchase-exemption-for-some-developers-impacted-by-pandemic/,Apple extends an in-app purchase exemption for some developers impacted by pandemic,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The pandemic isn’t over yet, according to Apple. The iPhone maker has once again pushed back a Covid-era deferral of an App Store rule that allowed app developers to bypass Apple’s in-app purchase system for specific services that had been forced to go virtual due to ongoing Covid outbreaks. Specifically, Apple will continue to defer its App Store Review Guideline 3.1.1 , which requires apps offering “paid online group services” to do so via in-app purchases. The impacted developers — whose original business models were built around in-person events, not virtual ones — have been able to forgo Apple’s requirement to use its in-app purchase system during the pandemic. Initially, Apple had only dropped the in-app purchase requirement on person-to-person services — like those involving a medical consultation between a doctor and patient, a tutoring session between a teacher and student, a real estate tour between a realtor and client, or a fitness training session between a trainer and client, for example. But Apple was soon publicly criticized by Meta (Facebook) , for continuing charge commissions on group services events that could hurt small businesses during a global pandemic. Facebook, of course, had an ulterior motive. It wanted Apple to give it permission to use Facebook Pay, its own payments system, where it was waiving fees, instead of Apple’s in-app purchases. Even if Apple had only temporarily agreed, Facebook would have been able to onboard many thousands of customers into its own payments ecosystem. Instead, Apple temporarily deferred its own fees for online group services, including one-to-few and one-to-many services, like online seminars or group yoga classes. This addressed Meta’s criticism that it was profiting off the backs of small businesses being crushed by the pandemic, while also not giving Facebook Pay any advantages. As the pandemic continued, however, Apple has had to keep pushing back the deadline that would have ended the deferral and returned these businesses to Apple’s in-app payments system. In November 2020, Apple extended the deadline for the deferral’s end to June 2021. And in April 2021, it extended it again to December 31, 2021. Last November, Apple reminded developers the deadline was soon approaching. Unfortunately, the impacts of the omicron variant caused Apple to push that deadline yet again. Now, the company says impacted developers will have until June 30, 2022, to return to Apple’s in-app purchase system — a date Apple clearly hopes will be a more palpable time frame to start tapping back into its lost revenue stream. The company also noted it’s extending the deadline to implement account deletion functionality inside apps that allow for account creation, due to “the complexity of implementing this requirement. In other words, it’s a change that’s time-consuming and difficult to implement, but even more so when businesses are again struggling with office closures, staff out sick with Covid, and kids attending virtual school at home. The extensions, announced quietly over the weekend with a post on Apple’s Developer site, come at a time when Apple’s in-app purchase business model is under attack from many sides. The company is engaged with a lawsuit with Epic Games, now under appeal , and was just fined by a Dutch regulator for not complying with antitrust rules as Apple continues to force developers to use its in-app purchase infrastructure for third-party payments. The company also had to recently comply with a similar rule over in-app payments in South Korea. Topics Consumer News Editor Sarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for January 27, 2022! Today’s news is a pretty positive roundup. New fund? Oh yeah. Huge rounds? You bet. We even have new unicorns to discuss. On the other side of the coin, the IPO market appears more ossified than open. – Alex We have a host of mega-rounds to chat through today, but first some words of warning: It appears that the IPO climate is frozen shut What that will mean for companies like Esusu, which just raised $130 million , or Ascend, which just raised $280 million in equity and debt for its BNPL-flavored approach to insurance, is that there is a mountain of private-market wealth out there that needs an exit. The question is just when those checks can be cashed. And if they will get more than a dollar back per dollar invested. IPO issues or not, the crypto world is busy taking on more external capital. One particular play in the blockchain world is the infrastructure effort, building products that will support other products. This is often a good bet. Twilio is an example of the infra game coming up trumps. AWS is another. So when another crypto backend player like Fireblocks pushes its valuation to $8 billion , we know what’s going on.

https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/uk-class-action-lodged-against-meta-seeks-3-1bn-for-breach-of-competition-law/,UK class action lodged against Meta seeks $3.1B for breach of competition law,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A competition legal expert, backed by a powerful litigation fund, is set to mount a multibillion-dollar class action suit against Facebook/Meta for breach of competition law on the basis that it abused its dominance of social networking in the U.K. for several years. If successful, the action would see Facebook having to pay $3.1 billion (£2.3 billion) in damages to Facebook U.K. users. The class action lawsuit was lodged against Meta, Facebook’s parent company, yesterday with the U.K.’s Competition Appeal Tribunal in London. The unusual approach claims Facebook should pay its 44 million U.K. users compensation for the exploitation of their data between 2015 and 2019. Effectively, it’s saying Facebook took all the personal and private data of its users — who, due to Facebook’s dominance, had no other viable social platform — and in return all its users got, in effect, was the ability to post pictures of babies and kittens to their friends and families. Dr Liza Lovdahl Gormsen The action is being mounted by international competition law expert Dr Liza Lovdahl Gormsen (pictured here) who has made submissions before the U.K.’s Parliament regarding Facebook’s market dominance, as well as written academic legal papers about it. Dr Lovdahl Gormsen’s case rests on the idea that Facebook (recently renamed Meta) set an “unfair price” for U.K. Facebook users. The “price” set for granting access to the social network was the surrender of U.K. users’ highly valuable personal data, who in return simply got “free” access to Facebook’s social networking platform, no financial compensation, all while Facebook generated billions in revenues. Key to the case’s argument is that Facebook “surrounded” its U.K. users not just by locking them and their data into its platform, but also by tracking them via the Facebook pixel, on other websites, thus generating deep “social graph” data about its users. Germain to Dr Lovdahl Gormsen’s argument is that user profiles resurfaced time and again in controversies, such as during the Cambridge Analytica scandal, further illustrating their market exploitation. Dr Lovdahl Gormsen’s lawyers, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, LLP, have written to Meta to notify them of the claim. Dr Lovdahl Gormsen will represent the class of people affected — that is, all people domiciled in the U.K. who used Facebook at least once during 1 October 2015 – 31 December 2019. The “opt-out” class action is the first of its kind against Meta in England and Wales. As an opt-out case, Facebook’s 4 million U.K. users will not need to actively join the case to seek damages, but will be part of the claim unless they decide to opt-out from it. Financial backing for the case is coming from Innsworth, one of the largest litigation funders in the world. Quinn Emanuel and Innsworth have previous history in bringing consumer class action claims of this kind. The wider context to this is that Meta is also facing a consumer class action in the U.S., regulatory action around the world and an antitrust suit from the FTC in the U.S. that could break it up from the Instagram and WhatsApp platforms. In a statement, Dr Lovdahl Gormsen said: “In the 17 years since it was created, Facebook became the sole social network in the UK where you could be sure to connect with friends and family in one place. Yet, there was a dark side to Facebook; it abused its market dominance to impose unfair terms and conditions on ordinary Britons giving it the power to exploit their personal data. I’m launching this case to secure billions of pounds of damages for the 44 million Britons who had their data exploited by Facebook.” Speaking to me over a call, I asked Dr Lovdahl Gormsen if Facebook could argue that there were other social networks available, such as Twitter or Myspace? “I don’t think people can connect to their family and friends in the same way on Twitter, and Snapchat and all these other places. Facebook is quite unique in the way they’re doing it,” she said. The action is also based on the ubiquity of the Facebook pixel on other websites. What is the significance of that to the case, I asked? “Imagine yourself as a Facebook user,” said Dr Lovdahl Gormsen. “You may be aware that your data will be used by Facebook.com. But what the pixels are doing is when you use a third-party website, that of course has nothing to do with Facebook. That means Facebook has created many, many, many more data points on you that you actually knew you’d signed up to.” She argues that although it’s possible for a user to remove themselves from Facebook’s platform, deep down in the Settings, in practice the vast majority of users have no idea how to do this or even know it’s possible. Dr Lovdahl Gormsen is a Senior Research Fellow at the British Institute of International and Comparative Law (BIICL), the director of the Competition Law Forum, a Non-Governmental Advisor to the International Competition Network and sits on the advisory board of the Journal of Antitrust Enforcement (OUP).

Amazon, which got its start selling books, is getting into the car business. The e-commerce giant along with new partner Hyundai announced Thursday at the 2023 LA Auto Show that it will start selling vehicles on its website in the second half of 2024. Hyundai vehicles will be the first vehicles sold on Amazon.com’s U.S. store with other brands following later in the year. The Amazon car sales section will allow customers to shop for vehicles in their area based on a range of preferences, including model, trim, color, and features, choose their preferred car, and then check out online with their chosen payment and financing options. Customers will be able to buy a vehicle online and then pick it up or have it delivered by their local dealership, according to Amazon. Amazon already sells car accessories and operates an “Amazon Vehicle Showrooms” site that allows manufacturers to advertise. But until now, customers couldn’t actually buy that car, truck or SUV they were researching. Amazon says this shopping experience “will create another way for dealers to build awareness of their selection and offer convenience to their customers,” language that suggests dealerships are on board with this move. The structure still rewards dealerships, unlike the direct sales models that completely sidestep the business model. When vehicles go on sale at Amazon, the local Hyundai dealer will be the seller of record. Mike Sullivan, the president and owner of several LA-area dealerships, including the Hyundai Santa Monica location, publicly supported the news while on stage at the LA Auto Show. “We’re now partnering with one of the world’s leading digital retailers,” Sullivan said. “They’ve led the way in delivering customer convenience, and now they’re going to help us take our customer experience to the next level. Amazon also brings massive reach and marketing power to connect to more customers. We can’t wait to get started.” Hyundai and Amazon are also partnering in other areas, the companies announced Thursday. Hyundai said it will use Amazon Web Services as its preferred cloud provider and will integrate Alexa voice assistant in the automaker’s next generation of vehicles starting in 2025.

The actual spacecraft — the startup’s first to go to orbit — will be made by SpaceX’s rival launch company, Rocket Lab, which will also make two subsequent space vehicles for Varda. The three vehicles will be outfitted with two Varda-made modules: a microgravity manufacturing module and a reentry capsule. The aim is for each spacecraft to spend approximately three months in orbit, with the reentry module bringing back around 40-60 kilograms of manufactured materials. Space manufacturing startup Varda inks deal with Rocket Lab for three spacecraft Varda’s goal is to unlock the benefits of microgravity — which can only be found for sustained periods in space — for manufacturing novel materials, like bio-printed organs or specialized semiconductors. The startup’s bet is that the potential market for such materials is high enough to make the effort worth it. The Torrance, California-based startup has been moving fast since its founding by SpaceX veteran Will Bruey and Founders Fund principal Delian Asparouhov a little less than a year ago. Varda announced a $42 million Series A in July, and plans on following an aggressive launch schedule, with two launches in 2023 and a third in 2024. The spacecraft will be one of many objects aboard the Falcon 9 rideshare mission, a new and lucrative program that spreads the cost of going to space between customers by allowing them to essentially carpool to space. SpaceX promises to slash the cost of launch to as low as $1 million for an individual customer looking to send up to 200 kilograms of payload to sun synchronous orbit.

https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/facebook-and-instagram-roll-out-personalized-year-in-review-features/,Facebook and Instagram roll out personalized ‘Year in Review’ features,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Meta, formerly known as Facebook, has rolled out “Year in Review” features for both Facebook and Instagram. On Facebook, users can share their personalized “Year Together” card, which highlights the friends, feelings, places and people that mattered most to them in 2021. The new in-feed experience reflects on people’s year on the platform and curates it into a shareable card. The new feature is available globally starting today and will be accessible until December 30th. On Instagram, users can share a custom end-of-year “Playback” time capsule to their IG Story. The feature leverages the Stories Archive, so users can customize and select up to 10 stories to share with their followers. To be eligible for this feature, users need to have posted more than three stories this year or have Stories Archive turned on. The platform will suggest Playback posts for you, but you’ll also have the option to pick what you want to share. Users will see a message in their Instagram feed inviting them to create their own Playback. The new feature will be available to users for several weeks. In previous years, Instagram users have created their own version of an end-of-year feature where they would post their top nine images in a photo grid. This year, Instagram is offering an in-app method for its users to create shareable end-of-year content. Both Facebook and Instagram’s new features are fully customizable so users can add or remove content and posts that they choose. Meta notes that these two features are rolling out over the next few days to all users around the globe. The launch of the new features comes as shareable end-of-year recaps have become increasingly popular thanks to Spotify’s annual Wrapped experience that is widely shared across social media each year. Facebook and Instagram join many other digital giants looking to mimic the popular feature by releasing their own versions. For example, Reddit rolled out personalized recaps with stats about users’ habits this week; meanwhile, Snapchat is expected to launch its “Year End Story” this month as well.

https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/patreon-cpo-interview-double-in-size-2022/,Patreon CPO says the company will double in size in 2022,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Creator monetization startups are cropping up left and right as the tech world embraces the fast-growing creator economy. But Patreon, founded in 2013, has been around since before words like “influencer” were in our vocabulary — back when “Tik Tok” was a Kesha song, rather than the social platform that everyone is trying to emulate . After tripling its valuation to $4 billion earlier this year, Patreon is at a crossroads. Will it continue to be the company to beat when it comes to building for creators? At the same time, can Patreon stay ahead of its competition while making creators feel that the product is looking out for their best interests? “We are not going to be one of those companies that defined the first eight years, but not the next eight years [of the creator economy],” Patreon Chief Product Officer Julian Gutman told TechCrunch. Speaking with TechCrunch about the platform’s plans for 2022, Gutman said that Patreon hopes to stay ahead of the curve by aggressively hiring, especially in product and engineering. Gutman himself only joined Patreon in January, bouncing over from Instagram, where he was head of Product for Instagram’s home feed experience. In August, Patreon also hired Senior VP of Engineering Utkarsh Srivastava , who formerly led teams at Google and Twitter. “We’ve hired 60 folks across product, engineering and design in the last quarter, and kind of expect that pace of hiring to continue into the next year,” Gutman said. “We have folks joining from Instagram, Uber and Square, and all these companies that I would say are like the first generation of the creator economy.” Patreon isn’t a new company, but Gutman thinks that since its mission from the get-go has been to help creative people make money, it’s better prepared to lead in this supposed “second generation” than social media platforms like his former employer Instagram. Regardless, social platforms are investing heavily in direct-to-creator payments . But Patreon’s model enables sustainable, monthly creator payouts, as opposed to one-time surprise bonuses The business of Patreon Patreon has 400 employees now, but Gutman said the company hopes to end next year with closer to 1,000 employees. Within product, engineering and design specifically, Patreon hopes to scale from 150 employees (including 60 recent hires) to 400 in 2022. “I think it’s a reflection of what we want to build, and the pace and the quality at which we want to build it,” Gutman said. “We’re really excited for potential creators right now, and we want to just be giving them as many tools as possible as quickly as possible to help them.” Patreon has already teased some of the projects it’s working on for 2022, including a native video platform (so exclusive video content can live on-platform, not in an unlisted YouTube link), an improved posting experience with more formatting options, different ways of organizing content on a Patreon page, more data and analytics, a cleaner app design, simpler playback experiences for multimedia and more. The platform is even planning to revamp its billing system , which Patreon says has been “a source of confusion and frustration” for many of its creators. But another big question for Patreon is whether it will bring crypto technology to the platform. Earlier this fall, Gutman, along with founder and CEO Jack Conte, confirmed that Patreon is exploring crypto as a way for creators to make money. Patreon floated the idea of crypto creator coins in its fall Creator Policy Engagement Program update, but at a subsequent livestream, creators expressed concerns about how Patreon dabbling in crypto could impact their relationships with their patrons. The actions that Patreon takes as a company impact the livelihoods of the creators making a living on their platform. Some creators on that livestream worried that if Patreon launched creator coins, their crypto-averse patrons might unsubscribe, even if they themselves weren’t using those tools. “There are some really interesting fundamental pieces of [crypto] technology that are actually quite aligned with our mission and what everyone’s wanted for the creator economy for a long time — rights ownership, independence, owning your content, owning your business, owning your audience, decentralization, all these themes,” Gutman told TechCrunch. “But I don’t think we’re ready to jump on any particular application or bandwagon.” Patreon does not have a dedicated team working on crypto, though there are some people in the company who are passionate about crypto and formed what Gutman called “an internal pod in their spare time.” He said that early next year, Patreon might consider building a small team of a few people dedicated to investigating how the company could possibly leverage crypto to support creators. “It’s not, ‘hey, let’s go build an NFT platform right now,’ but you know, a couple of folks that are focused on this full time,” Gutman said. “And by the way, they might conclude, ‘Hey, you know what, there’s nothing for us to build here right now,’ which is a totally fine, reasonable conclusion.” Patreon isn’t taking the question of whether or not to dip its toes into crypto lightly. The choice could divide its community and force creators to act as spokespeople for the company’s decisions, which can alienate individual creators’ patrons. Discord pushes pause on exploring crypto and NFTs amidst user backlash Earlier this month, Kickstarter announced it would move its crowdfunding platform to the blockchain, sparking backlash from users, especially those who have environmental concerns about some blockchain technology. Meanwhile, in November, Discord CEO Jason Citron tweeted an image of the crypto wallet MetaMask integrated into the chat platform’s interface. But even crypto-savvy users worried that linking crypto wallets with Discord accounts could make it easier to carry out fraud and scams on the platform. After some users urged each other to cancel their paid Discord Nitro subscriptions in protest of the company’s perceived movements toward crypto, Citron put out a statement saying that Discord doesn’t have plans to pursue the technology at this time. “I think one other important thing for us is over the next few years, we want to provide a toolset that creators can piece together differently,” Gutman said. “So we might have a crypto part of the toolset if we think there’s something there that creators might choose to use.” But more immediately, Gutman emphasized that community will be a focus for Patreon in 2022. “When people think creators, they think content. But so much of what creators do is community today,” Gutman said. “They really are these community leaders. They help communities come together around a shared topic of interest or a shared passion, and I think it’s a really undervalued part of what creators offer the world, particularly in this day and age.” Right now, a popular perk for creators to offer their fans is access to private, patron-only Discord servers. Gutman said that Patreon wants to create on-platform products for building community in addition to its suite of integrations with platforms like Discord. “We are creator-first, so if creators want to use an integration and they prefer an integration, we’re really excited by that,” Gutman said. “It’s not so much an on-platform versus off-platform type of battle, but we are really excited to look at building more first-party community tools, and one of the things we’re excited about is where content meets community.” Changes at a company like Patreon can be anxiety-inducing for creators who rely on the platform for their livelihood. In the new year, Patreon plans to conduct a creator census to maintain a direct line of communication with the people who stand to be most affected by big shifts in the company’s product plans.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/14/upgraded-tesla-cyberquad-for-kids-back-on-sale-after-safety-recall/,Upgraded Tesla Cyberquad for Kids back on sale after safety recall,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The Tesla Cyberquad for Kids, a $1,900 mini on-road ATV inspired by the yet-to-be delivered Cybertruck , is once again available to purchase at the Tesla Shop after a previous model was recalled in 2022 due to safety concerns. The Consumer Product Safety Commission said at the time that the mini ATV failed “to comply with the federal mandatory safety standard requirements for youth ATVs, including mechanical suspension and maximum tire pressure.” The CPSC also said the vehicle lacked an approved ATV action plan, which typically includes safety requirements like rider training, dissemination of safety information, age recommendations and other measures designed to reduce crash, injury and death hazards. Radio Flyer, the iconic American toy company that’s producing the new Model 915 Cyberquad for Kids, says the latest version of this battery-powered toy meets all CPSC requirements and ASTM F963 Toy Safety Standards. The Model 915 has replaced the rear spring with a steel tube with rubber-coated metal inserts that secures the rear frame to the main frame, according to Radio Flyer. The company has also updated the age grade to 9 to 12 years old (up from 8 to 12 years old), and has added a revised warning label on the front left fender that clearly states the Cyberquad is not for off-road use and is not a youth ATV. Radio Flyer also added a tire inflation warning label to the front left fender. Like its grander inspirational truck, the Cyberquad reps a sturdy steel frame and high-pressure rubber air tires. But that’s probably where the similarities end. The kid-version of the Cyberquad (there will apparently be an adult version, too), has a 500-watt motor with a max speed of 10 miles per hour. Radio Flyer’s battery provides about 15 miles of road time on a full charge, which takes about five hours, according to the company. Tesla first announced its kid-friendly Cyberquad launch at the end of 2021 . Radio Flyer also makes mini versions of Model S and Model Y vehicles for kids. The Cyberquad sold out “within minutes” of being launched, says Radio Flyer. Per the CPSC’s count, the earlier version sold about 5,000 units in total. Customers received full refunds on the vehicles after they were recalled. TechCrunch has reached out to Radio Flyer to determine how many units of the new Cyberquad have been sold since today’s announcement. As for the real Cybertruck, Tesla has finally committed to a release date of November 30 .

https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/10/polestar-tackles-softening-ev-demand-with-new-tech-and-next-gen-vehicles/,Polestar tackles softening EV demand with new tech and next-gen vehicles,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Polestar showcased this week its vision for the future: new tech and next-generation vehicles that the Swedish EV company owned by China’s Geely Holdings hopes will spark sales and spur an era of growth. The inaugural Polestar Day event in Los Angeles — designed to sell investors and journalists on its potential for a profitable future — stood in stark contrast to its present. Just a day prior, the company revised its outlook, cut delivery targets for 2023, announced a fresh investment from Volvo and Geely, and told the market that it’s still going to need another $1.3 billion in external funding in debt and equity until cash flows break even in 2025. Walking that line between the company’s financial reality and its product aspirations put even more focus on the event itself. “Polestar Day has of course, a big meaning for us to actually portray and highlight this innovation mélange that is coming together here,” Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath told TechCrunch in an interview during the event. And a mélange it was: The company showed off its full future line-up, including the Polestar 3, 4, 5, Polestar Precept, the Polestar Electric Roadster Concept and the Polestar Synergy. It also made a handful of announcements that at least nominally pulled together its vision for the future and offered investors and journalists rides in the upcoming Polestar 3 and Polestar 4 . The focus on upcoming models, extremely fast charging, automated driving sensor integration, future vehicle-to-grid technology and announcements about manufacturing suggests Polestar is taking an all-of-the-above approach to growth even as it faces headwinds. The headwinds are considerable. EV adoption has slowed, especially in the luxury market. The EV industry has been further hamstrung by high interest rates, tariff pressures to bring production to the U.S., economic uncertainty in China and two wars around the world. Polestar, a small, luxury, performance EV automaker, is in a tighter position — even with large-scale investors like Volvo and Geely. The company has just one model, the Polestar 2, in the U.S. market. With a recent downward revision to global sales for 2023, all eyes are on the Polestar 3 and Polestar 4. “When we talk about what is happening to this company in the next 18 months,” Ingenlath said, “these products are coming out in the market and at the same time, we’ve sat down and made sure that we are, in 2025, a profitable company that is cash flow break even.” The Polestar 3 is due to begin U.S. deliveries in early 2024 and the Polestar 4 goes into production soon, with deliveries in 2025. Ingenlath says that the company is counting on the Polestar 3 and Polestar 4 to help it reach its breakeven goals by 2025. “Polestar 3 and 4 are key enablers; they are the core of the business,” he said, underlining the company’s focus on price over volume. The company offered attendees the opportunity to ride along in pre-development versions of their forthcoming Polestar 3 and Polestar 4 in short, 10-minute trips around the Santa Monica Airport in stop-and-go traffic. The Polestar 3 is the more “luxurious,” and larger of the two vehicles, with an SUV-like roofline, ample backseat space and a fully digital cockpit. It’s also the first vehicle that the company has built on a completely new platform. From the backseat the Polestar 3 is quiet, cavernous and comfortable with plenty of leg and headroom. It comes with air suspension that lends itself to enough roadfeel to feel connected, without the heaviness, making it nimble and lighter on its feet. There’s a single vertical infotainment screen in the center of the dash, and a driver’s information screen attached to the steering wheel column. While you control most of the vehicle’s features (like one-pedal mode and different driving modes), through the main infotainment screen, controls for the headlights and windshield wipers are on the stalk within easy reach. The Polestar 4 is the SUV-coupe of the lineup, with a swooping roofline and — believe it or not — no rear window. That untraditional omission allowed designers to give rear passengers more headroom and legroom, according to the company. The Polestar 4 has a slightly shorter wheelbase than the 3, but from a rear passenger’s perspective, it doesn’t feel claustrophobic — even without the rear window. The Polestar 4 features the driver’s digital rearview mirror. The sunroof extends back just behind the crown of the rear passenger’s heads so it doesn’t feel like a coffin, even though there’s no glass behind the seats. Ambient lighting around the interior almost makes the lack of a rear window unnoticeable. The Polestar 4 also gets a large central infotainment screen, but it is oriented horizontally, rather than vertically and the driver’s information screen is mounted to the dash, instead of the steering column. There is no HUD in the Polestar 4, and unlike the 3, it comes with steel spring suspension. That set up makes it feel harsher on potholed roads and translates undulations and heavy-feeling movement for passengers in the rear seats. The technology and the ride-along experience wasn’t the surprising part. Instead, it was how excited customers who joined TechCrunch in the cars were for the future vehicles. One customer from Indiana told us that he had a Polestar 3 on order and during the ride along he was so thrilled by the infotainment screen features, he couldn’t keep his hands off them. Polestar also used its inaugural event to highlight tech partnerships with companies like Luminar, Mobileye and StoreDot, a battery company that Polestar invested in last year. Most of these tech partnerships, such as its relationship with lidar company Luminar, aren’t new; the companies had announced an agreement to work together in February this year, and plans to incorporate lidar alongside the Mobileye Chauffeur technology were announced in August 2023 The point, it seems, wasn’t to make new announcements, but instead show which capabilities these next-gen vehicles could have. For instance, the Polestar 4 will have lidar, which will support an advanced driver assistance system that will provide eyes-off automated driving on highways. That system, however, is not fully baked. During the presentation, Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua, who was not in attendance but had pre-recorded his statements, showed off video of a Polestar 4 using Mobileye technology to navigate a roundabout. While the vehicle was able to successfully enter traffic, merge and exit without input by the driver, it was not the smoothest execution. The video showed the prototype vehicle stopping and starting as it entered the roundabout traffic, much like an unsure driver would. During his recorded remarks, Shashua said that the video was recorded just last week. Perhaps one of the more intriguing companies highlighted at the event was StoreDot , an Israel-based battery company that makes pouch cell batteries with what it calls extremely fast-charging or XFC capabilities. Polestar first invested in StoreDot in May 2022 and now it’s aiming to incorporate a so-called “0-100 in 5 minutes” silicon anode battery technology into future EVs. StoreDot CEO and co-founder, Doron Myersdorf, was on hand at the Thursday event, demonstrating a small-scale model of the XFC battery technology, charging a few cells to 80% in just under eight minutes. StoreDot has developed the battery cells, while Polestar, a “key investor and collaborator,” has worked alongside the company to develop the battery chassis and liquid cooling system that keeps the fast-charging cells below 40 degrees C — a critical point for efficient charging. Myersdorf said that the technology had been tested through 1,000 fast-charging cycles and said that there was no more battery degradation than you’d find when charging slowly. “Slow charge and fast charge are the same for this technology,” Myersdorf said, “So you could basically get a warranty of half a million miles” on the battery. He also noted that the battery doesn’t just die after 1,000 charges but will only charge to 80%. Polestar and StoreDot say they will demonstrate the jointly developed battery pack at full scale in a Polestar 5 prototype sometime in 2024. Polestar also announced vehicle-to-grid or V2G plans in Sweden and California. The company has agreed to be a part of a coalition of energy distributors and suppliers, home charging suppliers and university researchers for a pilot project leveraging V2G technology and a fleet of Polestar 3s in and around Gothenberg, Sweden. In California, Polestar announced that it’s going to participate in a pre-study to create a roadmap for V2G technology in the state. The project in Sweden will run for two years, starting in 2024, and the pre-study in California will commence in December and run for a year. It’s still very early for this kind of technology, and there are plenty of hurdles to overcome — everything from legislative struggles to infrastructure. Yet if the V2G tech works as Polestar hopes, it would make Polestar’s new Virtual Power Plant or VPP usable. Polestar said that the cloud-based VPP system would allow Polestar3 owners to put energy back into the grid when their vehicle is parked — whether at home or out in public. As the EV industry continues to constrict, smaller automakers like Polestar will have to move quickly to stay afloat. Ingenlath says he’s upbeat about Polestar’s future. “We should not be super shocked about the EV market,” Ingenlath said referring to the softening of EV demand, “I mean, the crucial thing is how much are you prepared as a company to go through such a valley?” he continued. “We definitely will survive.” Topics LIMITED TIME: Save $300+ on your ticket, plus an additional 50% on a second for a full immersive day of AI!

https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/facebook-on-the-spot-in-kenya-as-exploitation-of-minors-rife-on-its-platform/,Facebook on the spot in Kenya as exploitation of minors rife on its platform,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Internet-based sexual exploitation of minors in Kenya was found to be more rampant on Facebook than on any other site, according to the newly released Disrupting Harm report — making the tech giant’s platform exceedingly unsafe for children. The report by Interpol, UNICEF’s Office of Research-Innocenti and End Violence against Children , found that Facebook accounted for more than 90% of all the instances of online sexual exploitation and abuse of minors in the East African country last year. The report was informed by data from the U.S. National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), interviews with minors, their parents, policing agencies and legal representatives. Alongside Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and YouTube made up other platforms where child sex abuse imagery and videos were commonly “possessed, manufactured and distributed”. This report comes in the wake of data from NCMEC showing that globally, Facebook reported more than 20 million child-sex abuse images last year, 37 times more than those reported by Google, which ranked second. It also succeeds investigations showing that Instagram seriously affects the mental health of teenage girls — even as Meta , Instagram’s parent company, mulled plans to launch the currently paused Instagram Kids for minors under 13 years. Meta told TechCrunch that it has taken several measures to protect minors using its platforms including using “sophisticated technologies” like PhotoDNA — which detects and removes images that exploit children — and by working closely with law enforcement agencies to stem the vice. “We have no tolerance for this abhorrent abuse of children and use sophisticated technologies to combat it,” said Meta, Eastern Africa communications manager, Janet Kemboi. “We encourage anyone who sees content they think violates our community standards to report it using our in-app reporting tools. We’ve recently made it easier to report content for violating our child exploitation policies, and now offer a dedicated option to report content that ‘involves a child’ on Facebook and Instagram. These reports are prioritized for review,” she said. Overall, incidents of online child sexual abuse in Kenya also increased by six percentage points, to 14,434 occurrences, according to CyberTipline reports from the NCMEC. The CyberTipline is a centralized system for reporting incidents of sexual exploitation of minors. Kenya is the only country in East Africa that is connected directly to NCMEC’s reporting system through its Directorate of Criminal Investigation’s (DCI) Anti-Human Trafficking & Child Protection Unit (AHTCPU) and Interpol’s International Child Sexual Exploitation Database. “WhatsApp and Facebook or Facebook Messenger were the social media and instant messaging apps via which children were most commonly targeted. This is probably because Facebook and WhatsApp – the two most popular social media platforms in Kenya – are where children spend much of their time online,” the report said. Mueni Mutisya, the AHTCPU in-charge, told TechCrunch that the authority receives about 22 cybertip reports daily. She said the country has experienced a spike in cases recorded since the start of the COVID pandemic, a situation that has also been fueled by the use of social sites. “Social media has enhanced sharing, production and distribution of online sexual exploitation and abuse (OCSEA). It has become much easier for predators to trick young people into sharing explicit images of themselves and falling prey to an overly sexualized culture.” WhatsApp is the most popular social app in Kenya followed by Facebook and YouTube according to this social media landscape report. To date, more than three quarters of Kenya’s population is connected to the internet, making sites like Facebook and WhatsApp easily accessible. In what looks like a shift in how offenders’ prey on children, more than half of the victims interviewed for the report said the request for sexual materials were made online rather than offline — as one in five minors said they were approached in person. Minors aged 12 to 17 were most at risk of facing online sexual exploitation, according to the study which also reported that both girls and boys faced the same level of risk online. The offenders were found to be often known to the victims and used gifts or money (sexual extortion) to sway the minors to meet with them or to share imagery or videos. The offers were commonly done through “Facebook or Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and through YouTube”. A few cited Instagram and ByteDance’s platform TikTok. However, others were blackmailed or threatened into sharing or taking part in obscenities. The report further indicated that foreign law enforcement agencies found Kenya to be a source of commercial forms of livestreaming of child sexual abuse. search engine trends showed that sex offenders in the country were in search of images and videos “depicting sexual activity with and between teenagers, with children and babies. Reports of security agencies identified Kenya as a hotspot for foreign traveling child-sex offenders too. Online grooming of children for sexual purposes with the intent of manipulating them into generating and sharing abuse material, without any intention of meeting or abusing them in person, was also rife on social sites. The report said that this is one of the forms of OCSEA (together with livestreaming) that is not treated as a criminal offense in Kenya currently. Offenders can only be charged based on the Computer Misuse Act, which penalizes the perpetrators for exposing a child to sexualized content and the Sexual Offences Act that criminalizes child pornography. “In Kenya, the provision of the upcoming Children Bill 2021 addressing online grooming will only cover online grooming with the intent of meeting the child and may not therefore apply to situations where, for example, a child is asked to send sexual content to an offender via online platforms,” the report noted. The bill, which is currently going through legislative approval, was submitted in 2020. A fortnight ago, lawmakers invited the public to make recommendations for the new law — providing an opportunity for this gap to be plugged. “It is hoped that a provision outlawing grooming where the sexual abuse occurs online could still be included,” the report said. Owing to the cross-border nature of these crimes, Kenya works closely with international and local authorities to track the activities of the offenders and to make arrests. Kenya’s DCI AHTCPU also works with the country’s communications regulator to alert the public of the nature of these crimes and to encourage them to make reports. “Because of the Global nature of internet crimes, the DCI AHTCPU has partnered with other national and international strategic partners to help in the fight against OCSEA. We use Interpol to issue notices in case of cross border OCSEA cases,” said Mutisya. “We also work closely with the International Liaison Officer at the British High commission and the FBI legal attaché at the U.S. Embassy (in Kenya) as well as our international counterparts to seek justice for victims of online abuse and follow up on offenders. This is in addition to public outreach and school visits to educate, create awareness and sensitize,” she said. Disrupting Harm authors hope the findings made in the report will offer a road map for the adoption of strategies for dealing with the online sexual abuse of children.

https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/bipartisan-bill-seeks-to-curb-recommendation-algorithms/,Bipartisan bill seeks to curb recommendation algorithms,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A bipartisan group of House lawmakers has introduced legislation that would give people more control over the algorithms that shape their online experience. If passed, the Filter Bubble Transparency Act would require companies like Meta to offer a version of their platforms that runs on an “input-transparent” algorithm that doesn’t pull on user data to generate recommendations. The bill would not do away with “opaque” recommendation algorithms altogether but would make it a requirement to include a toggle that allows people to switch that functionality off. Additionally, platforms that continue to use recommendation algorithms need to have a notification that informs people those recommendations are based on inferences generated by their personal data. The prompt can be a one-time notice, but it would need to be presented in a “clear, conspicuous manner,” according to the proposed bill. The legislation was introduced by Representatives Ken Buck (R-CO), David Cicilline (D-RI), Lori Trahan (D-MA) and Burgess Owens (R-UT). It’s a companion bill to legislation Senators John Thune of South Dakota and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut introduced this past June. “Consumers should have the option to engage with internet platforms without being manipulated by secret algorithms driven by user-specific data,” Buck told Axios , the first outlet to report on the legislation. Lawmakers have frequently criticized social media giants for using recommendation algorithms to boost user engagement, but so far, there’s been little legislative action to curb their use. In the aftermath of the January 6th US Capitol attack, a group of more than 30 Democratic lawmakers called on Meta ( then known as Facebook ), Twitter and YouTube to make substantive changes to their recommendation engines but ultimately stopped short of threatening regulatory action. Although the Filter Bubble Transparency Act has bipartisan support across the House and Senate, it’s unclear if it would pass. Editor’s note: This article originally appeared on Engadget .

https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/12/facebook-launches-shops-in-groups-and-live-shopping-for-creators/,Facebook launches Shops in Groups and Live Shopping for Creators,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Facebook announced today that it’s rolling out new shopping features: Shops in Groups, product recommendations and a test of Live Shopping for Creators. Shops in Groups enables admins of Facebook groups to set up an online store on their associated Facebook Page. It’s up to the admins where this money goes — in the case of OctoNation, a page that tested the feature, the profits went to OctoNation’s nonprofit that educates people about octopuses (octopi?). This could get hairy in groups that don’t have a clear philanthropic aim, but it’s not as though Facebook groups have never been sites for drama before. Still, Yulie Kwon Kim, Meta’s vice president of Product Management, pointed out that many group admins are volunteers, and these shops could offer them a revenue stream for their work. “The money goes to the group admin, and they can decide how they want to use it,” she told TechCrunch. “This is a great way for people to sustain and keep the group going.” Facebook had previously announced its plans for group monetization features — including shops, fundraisers and subscriptions — at its Facebook Communities Summit hosted earlier this month. Facebook also said that users often ask for product recommendations in groups — think about a skincare or makeup group — so now, if a user mentions a product that is listed in a Facebook shop, they can tag it and embed it into their comment. Top product recommendations from groups will appear within users’ news feeds. Facebook has had Live Shopping for years , but as partnerships between brands and creators become more common, the app has begun testing a feature that would make these collaborations appear more seamless. Now, instead of an influencer directing fans to another page to watch them sell a product or vice versa, creators and brands can cross-stream on both of their pages. This year, Facebook — now under the company name Meta — has consistently worked on building out shopping tools for businesses and creators. So it only makes sense that as the holiday season draws nearer, the company is launching more ways to spend money on the Facebook app. These features will be available starting today on the web and on the Facebook mobile apps for iOS and Android. Right now, Meta’s primary revenue stream comes from advertising, but the company’s investment in shopping could offer another source of income. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced this summer that as Meta rolls out more creator and commerce tools, it’s committed to not taking a cut from the earnings of businesses and creators until 2023. He added that when the company does introduce a revenue share, it will be less than Apple’s 30% cut. But by building a robust infrastructure for e-commerce now, the company is positioning itself for future profit.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/06/lucid-adopts-teslas-charging-standard/,Lucid adopts Tesla’s charging standard,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Lucid has reached an agreement that will give owners of its luxury EVs access to Tesla’s network of superchargers — following the path of Ford, GM and the majority of automakers that sell EVs in North America have taken in recent months. Ford kicked off the trend in May 2023 when it announced its EV owners would soon have access to about 12,000 Tesla chargers initially via an adapter; Ford added that its next generation of EVs would be integrated with Tesla’s charge port called the North American Charging Standard (NACS) starting in 2025. GM , Rivian, Honda, Mercedes , Hyundai, Kia, Toyota and most recently Subaru followed with their own announcements to adopt Tesla’s charging standard. Lucid was one of the last remaining holdouts. Like previous announcements, Lucid will begin by providing owners of its EVs, which are built with the Combined Charging System (CCS), with an adapter that will give it access to thousands of Tesla chargers, known as Superchargers. Lucid will incorporate Tesla’s NACS charging port into its EVs starting in 2025. “Adopting NACS is an important next step to providing our customers with expanded access to reliable and convenient charging solutions for their Lucid vehicles,” said Peter Rawlinson, CEO and CTO at Lucid. “We believe that a unified charging standard, backed by the nationwide rollout of future-ready higher-voltage charging stations, will be a critical step in empowering American consumers to adopt electric vehicles.” Lucid’s decision puts access over quickness — at least for now. Lucid’s luxury Air sedans have a 900-volt electric architecture, which has a higher thermal efficiency and in turn, can lead to better range and much faster charging. Most electric vehicles — with the exception of the Audi E-Tron GT, Porsche Taycan, Kia EV6 and Hyundai Ioniq 5 — have a 400-volt architecture. For EVs with 800-volt electric systems to reap the full benefits of fast charging times, it needs proper charging equipment that can take advantage of that architecture. Most public chargers have 400-volt systems and today’s Tesla Superchargers are rated at about 500 volts. This means that Lucid, and any other EV with 800-volt charging systems, won’t be able to charge as fast as they might with chargers designed for them, as Consumer Reports noted last month. For now, this is a small point, considering how rare 800-volt fast chargers are out in the world. Lucid spokesperson Andrew Hussy told TechCrunch that Tesla’s current charging system helps Lucid customers with the convenience of more charging options. But he noted that in the future, Tesla is supposed to start offering much higher voltage charging.

The new round values the Bengaluru-headquartered electric vehicle startup — which supposedly has no ongoing relationship with the ride-hailing startup Ola but continues to share resources, much to many investors’ chagrin — at about $5.4 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter. Ola Electric and Ola, both of which have the same comms team, didn’t respond to a request for comment. Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund Temasek led the funding round, whose name Ola Electric didn’t disclose, and Indian government-backed lender State Bank of India bankrolled the debt, the startup said in a statement. Ola Electric, which recently launched several new lower-priced variants of its flagship S1 electric scooter model and also an upgraded version, leads the EV scooter market with more than 30% market share, according to industry data. “Despite a reduction in subsidies, most feature-rich EVs continue to be 13-23% cheaper than ICE scooters over a five-year ownership cycle (after accounting for lower resale value of EVs). Moreover, the Ola S1 Air and X are actually cheaper than even entry-level motorcycles on a TCO basis,” JP Morgan analysts wrote in a recent note. Ola Electric, which lost more than $130 million in the financial year that ended in March on a revenue of about $330 million, said it would deploy the funds to expand its EV business and set up what it said would be “India’s first lithium-ion cell manufacturing facility” in Krishnagiri in the Southern state of Tamil Nadu. “At Ola, our vision is to end ICE age in automobiles and our upcoming Gigafactory will be a big leap in India’s journey towards becoming a global EV hub,” said Bhavish Aggarwal, founder and chief executive of Ola Electric, in a statement. “We are committed towards developing core technologies in EVs and cell and are rapidly scaling up manufacturing to further accelerate the transition to sustainable mobility. Our investors and lenders have shown deep faith in Ola’s vision, and we thank them for the constant support and encouragement.” Topics Reporter, India LIMITED TIME: Save $300+ on your ticket, plus an additional 50% on a second for a full immersive day of AI!

The company announced the updated schedule on Twitter, while also confirming that the launch will take place out of Cape Canaveral in Florida. A few updates on #Terran1 : ✅We’re excited to share that Stage 2 passed cryo pressure proof + hydro mechanical buckling test on our structural test stand.

Stage 1 structural testing is to follow. The news of the delay comes just two months after Relativity said ( also on Twitter ) that the Terran 1 would launch in winter of this year. The rocket that will perform the orbital demonstration flight will not be carrying any payload, but the company has already scheduled a second launch to take place June 2022. That rocket will carry CubeSats to low-Earth orbit as part of NASA’s Venture Class Launch Services Demonstration 2 (VCLS Demo 2) contract. A company spokesperson told TechCrunch that there is “no one single reason” why the launch date has been pushed back. “Over the past year, Relativity has … refined Terran 1’s architecture, developed a brand new engine and upgraded its material while COVID slowed a few of its processes down,” the spokesperson added. “They updated the demonstration launch to early 2022 so they can better coordinate with partners.” The launch will mark the world’s first of an entirely 3D-printed rocket. Relativity’s tech has garnered quite a lot of interest from investors — so much that its valuation vaulted to $4.2 billion after a $650 million funding round this summer. In addition to the Terran 1, the company is also developing a second heavy-lift, fully reusable rocket it’s calling Terran R. It aims to launch that rocket as early as 2024.

Right now this industry is full of products that are cumbersome and ugly enough that you’d probably swipe left on Beyoncé wearing a pair, but this past week I had the chance to play with one that was, okay, still pretty unfashionable, but also really amazing. CEO Meron Gribetz unveiled the Meta 2 augmented reality headset at TEDx 2016 last month, showing off — among other things —  the headset’s incredibly large, near 90-degree, field-of-view. Following the event, the team from Meta invited me and the TC video crew down to their offices in Redwood City to take a look at their “natural machine.” The company had grown quite a bit since TechCrunch’s last demo with them in 2014. The former Y-Combinator company has hired aggressively and gathered funding, including a $23 million Series A last year. After considerable hype (and a ceremonial red velvet cloth unveiling) I had the chance to try it on. Check out the video above for footage from the demo and my point-of-view. There were definitely moments of brilliance. I really could nerd out about the Meta 2’s (2560×1440) display for days. Field-of-view (FoV) matters a hell of a lot more on augmented reality devices than it does on VR headsets. With virtual reality, the more squashed the FoV, the more constrained your viewpoint is, but everything that isn’t the screen is just blackness and thus not all that distracting. In AR, low FoV means that it looks like there’s a little translucent window into the virtual world that you have to fit floating 3D content into. It sucks. The original Meta (also tethered) had a FoV between 25 and 35 degrees which is quite small but comparable to other existing AR experiences, though still a bit less than HoloLens’ speculated FoV. The near 90-degree field-of-view on the new Meta 2 is more expansive than anything I’ve seen to date and was sizable enough that everything I was viewing felt like it had visual context and wasn’t just butting into my regularly scheduled line of sight. For comparison’s sake, the Gear VR mobile headset offers 98-degree field-of-view. The tethered nature of the Meta 2 is undoubtedly what makes a FoV of this size possible. Microsoft could likely physically do the same on the HoloLens but it’s all about tradeoffs at this point, and Microsoft chose to give developers all-in-one mobility where Meta chose to anticipate advances in technology and give developers a wired experience that it believes in can untether and shrink before Meta goes on to become a consumer product. “Generation over generation you’re going to see a dramatic miniaturization,” Ryan Pamplin, Meta’s VP of Sales and Partnerships, told me. “Today it’s about getting it in the hands of all of the developers who have been waiting for this.” Meta CEO Meron Gribetz also believes these devices will shrink down significantly, but once that happens, he believes consumer focuses will shift away from hardware. “… in about 5 years, these are all going to look like strips of glass on our eyes that project holograms.” Gribetz said onstage at TEDx 2016 last month. “And just like we don’t care so much about which phone we buy in terms of the hardware; we buy it for the operating system, as a neuroscientist, I always dreamt of building the IOS of the mind, if you will.” I’m not as sold on the actual interface elements for the Meta 2 as I am on the hardware. While the navigation was simple to learn, I question whether the “natural machine” is approaching input realistically. Being surrounded by the tech-obsessed posse that I was, I had little appreciation for the fact that I did indeed look like a total idiot while I was navigating the Meta 2 demo. But to be honest, I was just having too much fun to care. Worrying about appearances can feel shallow when you’re grasping at the future through a product as mind-bogglingly cool as Meta 2, but when you consider the theoretical potential of augmented reality devices as smartphone replacements you need to be more critical. Even if the Meta 2 had the form factor of a pair of Wayfarers, I still wouldn’t be caught dead reaching my arms out and grabbing shit out of the sky in public. I will grab shit out of the sky for days in virtual reality where I’m locked into my obliviousness and in a space like my living room, but I can only crunch so much tech in the wide open. That being said, the hand-tracking controls were a bit more brutish than I would hope, especially dim in comparison to my recent experiences with Leap Motion’s latest Orion update. Grabbing virtual items with Meta 2 required me to thrust my open hand into a virtual object and close my fingers to make a fist in order to select and move the objects. This was certainly simple enough for moving larger, otherwise stationary objects like a digital computer monitor, but the occasionally jittery demo left me somewhat skeptical that I would be able to tap a hyperlink with ease from a virtual web browser though it is apparently easy to utilize a physical keyboard and mouse in conjunction with the device. Much of these differences in quality come from the fact that while Leap Motion is making dynamic digital skeletons of your hands, Meta is using a variety of sensors and a high-def camera to actively map not only your hands but the environment they are manipulating. I have no doubts that these technologies will only continue to improve, but at the moment they were a bit of a let down compared to the mind-bending display. If/when augmented reality catches on with consumers, I also have significant doubts that hand-tracking will play a major role in how we interact with reality. Among other things, it’s just too conspicuous. Hands and fingers may be the more precise input option in theory, but the discretion offered by eye-tracking will likely make it the go-to input method for augmented reality consumer devices moving forward (keep in mind that right now Meta 2 is first-and-foremost a developer kit for an enterprise-focused solution). Input will work itself out as augmented reality companies adapt to consumer, ahem, input, but a major key right now is getting the tech to a point where consumers give a shit. The Meta 2 will help make that happen, but it’s on developers to dream up the use cases that prove the platform. Even as companies like Meta and Microsoft prepare the releases of their dev kits, a strange beast looms on the horizon of augmented reality (i.e. somewhere in Miami). Magic Leap, which has raised nearly $1.4 billion from investors like Google and Alibaba, is building a light field display which will beam holographic images directly onto your eyeballs. Light field displays, which Pamplin called “exciting,” have the potential to dramatically shrink the size of today’s existing AR headsets. The mainstream dominance of augmented reality seems flexibly inevitable. While virtual reality is grabbing early headlines with consumer devices headed to market, keep in mind that companies have been building expensive enterprise-focused VR headsets for decades to get to this point. The Meta 2 is an early step towards an augmented future I’m sure we’re at least a decade from, but innovative developers ready to hop on the platform when it launches later this year can likely get us a head start. Pre-orders of the $949 Meta 2 developer kit go live today and the company says devices will ship in Q3 of 2016. Topics Lucas Matney was a senior editor at TechCrunch based in San Francisco.

The top automaker by global sales, Toyota is the latest to back the North American Charging Standard (NACS), following Hyundai, Kia , Honda Nissan Mercedes GM and Ford , among others. In just about five months, Tesla has virtually sidelined the Combined Charging System (CCS), the standard backed by the Biden administration . The switch should make it easier for EV buyers to access Tesla’s charging network , but it won’t happen overnight. The aforementioned automakers say they’ll start introducing EVs with NACS support in 2025, with Mercedes and GM saying they’ll drop adapters in 2024. It also happens that Toyota’s North American EV sales (including hybrids) are way up lately — by 20% so far this year, the company said in early October. When it comes to NACS, VW and Stellantis are the two big holdouts left. VW has reportedly been in talks with Tesla about the standard since the summer.

Perhaps more troubling is the year-over-year comparison. Lucid delivered 1,398 vehicles in the third quarter of 2022, meaning growth over the past year is nearly flat. It was the same story on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Lucid’s third-quarter deliveries were just slightly higher than the 1,404 vehicles it delivered to consumers in the second quarter. The results sent shares down about 3.6% as investors grew concerned that demand for the company’s only EV has softened. Lucid also reported Tuesday it produced 1,550 Airs in the third quarter with more than 700 additional vehicles in transit to Saudi Arabia for final assembly. Lucid produced 2,282 vehicles in the third quarter of 2022. Lucid has had a roller coaster year that included hitting a production milestone in January, missing Wall Street’s delivery expectations in February, recalling hundreds of vehicles and downsizing its workforce in March, posting weaker-than-expected revenue and earnings in May, landing a deal with Aston Martin in June and falling short of Q2 expectations in July. The deal with Saudi Arabia may be the lifeline Lucid needs to keep it afloat until it can begin producing and selling the next EV in its portfolio, the Gravity SUV. The company has said it plans to reveal the Gravity SUV in November with production not beginning until 2024. The government of Saudi Arabia, which is connected to the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund that owns 60% of Lucid, announced last year plans to buy 100,000 the automaker’s electric vehicles over the next decade. Lucid opened in September a factory in Saudi Arabia, that will have an initial capacity to assemble 5,000 Lucid vehicles annually. Lucid said it plans to expand the facility to 150,000-vehicle production capacity. Workers at the plant will initially re-assemble Lucid Air vehicle kits that are pre-manufactured at the company’s U.S. factory in Casa Grande, Arizona. Lucid aims to transition the Saudi Arabian factory to complete build unit production after the middle of the decade.

https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/pyka-shows-off-its-new-electric-passenger-plane-the-p3/,"Pyka shows off its new electric passenger plane, the P3",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Pyka appeared out of nowhere in 2019 with an unusual take on electric aircraft: a pilotless crop duster. The success of this first plane led the company to begin developing its next one, the P3: a nine-passenger craft with a totally unique propeller setup aimed at making regional flights cheaper and simpler. It could be flying as soon as next year. The company also has a new president in Dan Grossman, formerly of Zipcar, Ford and Maven. The transportation sector DNA he brings could help Pyka create the networks and partnerships it needs to get off the ground in local air travel. The P3 is intended to fly up to 200 nautical miles (about 230 of our lubber miles) at 155 knots, in other words doing the kind of hour-ish hops people opt for instead of a long drive. Currently these routes are served by larger, more expensive aircraft that often fly half-full, making the economics a bit squirrelly. But by Pyka’s estimate its smaller, much less expensive to operate aircraft will allow for more full flights per day between regional hubs. “It’s mostly places where driving 150 miles is unfeasible,” said founder and CEO Michael Norcia. “The amount of money people spend driving these regional routes, it’s a staggering amount — billions of dollars, and they’re not happy about it.” Existing small craft flights are prohibitively expensive, but Norcia thinks the P3 will be able to match bulk airfare rates while offering many more flights per day and more destinations. The aircraft itself looks quite conventional, until you look closely… are those propellers on the fronts and backs of the wings? “It hasn’t been done before,” said Norcia. And it bears a brief explanation why. Small planes like this need to change the pitch of their propellers from one configuration during takeoff and climbing to another during cruising, since a different angle is needed for each task. That means the propeller blades have to tilt, which isn’t simple. “In a normal aircraft, it makes sense to have this quite complex and heavy mechanism on your propeller in order to operate optimally over the whole range,” said Norcia. “Electric propulsion provides some opportunities to just massively simplify the aircraft. So all four of the propellers are fixed-pitch: the ones in front are pitched for takeoff and climb out, and the rear ones are for cruising.” With a heavy, complex, expensive traditional engine, it would be silly to double the number just so you don’t have to use variable pitch propellers for takeoff. But with light, simple, inexpensive electric engines, it makes perfect sense to do so, even if it looks unusual. The front and rear propellers are only both active during take-off and climbing, with the front ones folding away afterwards as then the rear ones take over completely for cruise. It mechanically simplifies things — no heavy duty hinges and hydraulics — and in fact putting the prop back there seems to improve efficiency by about 10%, said Norcia. “It’s pretty cool,” he added. (And they’ve applied for a patent.) ( Update : I misunderstood the way the propellers share work and have updated the preceding paragraphs to reflect that.) The general size and shape of the P3 are familiar, however, and that’s not an accident. “We’re starting clean sheet,” Norcia said, as the unconventional prop setup attests, “but the approach to this aircraft was talking to customers and regulators and finding out what they want. The answer was resoundingly a nine-passenger plane.” This is partly because of regulatory requirements: planes with certain burdens and passenger counts fall under a simpler, more permissive regulatory regime, as do airlines that fly with nine or fewer seats. Therefore, the simplest path forward seems to be a nine-passenger plane that makes big progress on efficiency and affordability while not reinventing the wheel. Further expediting its transition from twinkle in the eye to actual flying machine is starting the P3 out as an unmanned cargo vehicle, essentially a drone for medium-size payloads. There’s a limited market for this (unmanned small aircraft can’t fly ordinary overland cargo routes), but it’s a way to put the P3 in the air legally and get the ball rolling with regulators before aiming for the more important passenger plane certification. The goal is to have P3 in the air by the end of 2022, which is an extremely aggressive timeline for a brand new aircraft. But Pyka has already shipped two aircraft, the prototype Egret crop dusting craft and the production Pelican version. “We started the company because we think electric aviation will fundamentally change the way we move for the better,” said Norcia. “It’s unprecedented times for electric aircraft, but most are taking pre-orders for aircraft that may get certified some time in the next decade. We just shipped two Pelicans in the last three months.” Grossman said that was a major factor in his choice to join the company and help it scale: “They’re shipping right now, and planning on shipping one plane a month next year. They’ve been incredibly efficient with the money they’ve made.” Of course, launching a new aircraft is an expensive endeavor, and Norcia said that they are in the middle of raising a big round to fund production scaling and to fly a full-sized P3. If all goes well the passenger version could be in the air as soon as 2025.

They want to be taken as seriously as movie and music reviewers. The problem is game reviews are inherently so niche they’ll never be mainstream. :-( • Because of this, game reviewers are driven mad by trying to appear “proper,” at the expense of the reviews making much sense for their target audience: gamers. • As such, reviewing games isn’t nearly as fun as you thought it’d be when you were 14 • “Being clever does not make you a good critic; it just makes you entertaining to your five friends.” Please note that I don’t even have five friends, so if I ever come across, in any of my posts, as trying to be clever, it’s for no one’s entertainment but my own. Now I’d ask the y’all what makes a good video game review, but I already know the answer: tell the people if the game is fun or not. “This game is a whole lot of fun, check it out.” Done and done.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/10/what-drove-online-used-car-marketplace-shift-to-file-for-bankruptcy/,What drove online used car marketplace Shift to file for bankruptcy,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Shift Technologies, the San Francisco-based online used car startup turned publicly traded company, filed this week for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The short story, according to recent filings, is that the company’s deteriorating cash position and inability to obtain further financing drove the company to file for bankruptcy and begin the process of closing down the business and liquidating assets. About 144, or 80% of the company’s employees, were terminated last week and 24 are remaining on to wind down operations. Shift has estimated that process will cost between $4.1 and $5 million, according to SEC filings . Of course, there are a few twists and turns that may have accelerated Shift’s demise. The company announced Friday it would file for bankruptcy and said it was shutting down its two physical locations in California. Shift filed Monday its petition with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California. How did Shift get here? Let’s turn to the bankruptcy filings. Shift was founded in 2014, an era when a number of online used car startups launched in a bid to disrupt the traditional dealership model. Carvana, Shift, Vroom and Beepi, which shut down in 2016 and merged with Fair , were among the buzziest. Money was raised, valuations popped and some, including Carvana and Vroom , took the road to IPO. When the SPAC boom arrived in summer 2020, Shift jumped at the chance to access more capital. George Arison, a co-founder and co-CEO of Shift at the time, even wrote a column in TechCrunch outlining how to navigate SPACs, a process in which a privately held company merges via a publicly traded blank check company. The COVID-19 pandemic also arrived and turned used car sales into one of the hottest markets. The timing, it seemed, couldn’t have been better. The past year, however, has delivered inflationary concerns, a slightly cooling used car market, higher interest rates, tighter capital markets and overall economic uncertainty. Even with these factors beginning to percolate, Shift was still investing “significantly” in its technology platforms and turning to mergers and other investments in an effort to drive growth through volume and presence, the company’s first day motion petition notes. In spring 2022, Shift acquired competitor Fair’s dealer listing marketplace. It then merged with consignment-to-retail used vehicle company CarLotz by the end of 2022, pushing its employee count to about 590 people. Shift said the Fair acquisition was intended to help the company “build a digital marketplace where both dealers and independent sellers could list their cars alongside Shift’s owned inventory,” according to one bankruptcy filing. Meanwhile, the CarLotz merger was designed to leverage its presence and dealer marketplace platform on the East Coast through a new omnichannel experience. But by February 2023, just two months after the merger had closed, Shift decided to exit CarLotz’s presence on the East Coast and shut down the Downers Grove, Illinois location in order to focus on core West Coast markets. One remaining CarLotz facility in Pomona, California remained open alongside Shift’s locations in Los Angeles, San Francisco Bay Area and Portland. The cracks were clearly visible by the end of Q1 2023. Shift laid off 30% of staff and reported it had generated $65.6 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, a 67% drop from the same year-ago period. Shift also reported operating loss of $60.7 million in the fourth quarter, a 14% increase from the same period in 2021. Shift may have been cutting costs through layoffs, but it was still spending its cash on developing its technology, a growth-over-profits strategy that Wall Street was rejecting. Shift tried to shift gears altogether in June 2023. The company brought on new management and ditched its e-commerce development, instead pivoting to a dealership model focused on profitable growth. Shift contends the move was too little, too late. Shift still would need more capital to institute these changes in a bid toward profitability. Despite “months negotiating with the holders of the company’s convertible notes and senior unsecured notes,” it was unable to reach an agreement to restructure the outstanding debt and gain additional financing.

This is an expansion of the company’s existing license, which had granted it permission to fly professional test pilots and astronauts to space using its spaceplane. The updated license comes on the heels of Virgin Galactic’s successful test flight on May 22. This means that the way is cleared for Virgin Galactic to being operating as the first official ‘spaceline’ — which is like an airline, but for space. The company aims to provide regular service for space tourists and researchers to suborbital space, with an experience that includes unparalleled views of Earth and a few minutes of weightless during the roughly 2 hour trip. The FAA’s approval is a big step, but it’s not the final one before Virgin Galactic begins its actual regular service flights for paying customers: The company still needs to complete three remaining test flights before that happens. These will be the first flights of the Virgin spacecraft and its carrier plane while carrying a full crew, and that the goal is still to fly the first of those sometime “this summer,” according to CEO Michael Colglazier. A report from earlier this month claims that Virgin Galactic backer Sir Richard Branson could fly on the next test flight, and that it might occur as early as the coming July 4 weekend, which would mean he makes it to space faster than his billionaire rocket riding rival Jeff Bezos, who is set to make a trip on his own Blue Origin New Shepard spaceship on July 20. Virgin Galactic hasn’t said officially when its next test flight would occur, however, and sources confirm that the Parabolic Arc report is incorrect.

The company has developed a small launch vehicle it calls Eris, a 25-meter (82 foot) rocket that can deliver a payload of up to 215 kilograms (474 pounds) to sun synchronous orbit. Now, it’s raised a $61 million AUD ($46 million USD) Series C round to take Eris to space next year. Eris is much smaller than other launch companies’ rockets. Relativity Space’s Terran One has a max payload capacity to LEO of around 1,250 kg (2,756 lbs); even SpaceX’s Falcon 1, its first and smallest orbital rocket, could deliver 450 kg (990 pounds). Gilmour Space is wagering that the lighter payload will result in lower costs for a burgeoning suite of customers looking to send spacecraft to orbit. The funds will also go toward nearly doubling the company’s workforce, from 70 to 120 employees, and developing a new commercial spaceport at Abbot Point, Queensland. Australian legislators approved construction of the launch site in May. Gilmour Space is also examining a proposed launch site in South Australia to facilitate polar orbit launches. Gilmour Space has already signed agreements with prospective customers for future Eris launches. This includes contracts with two Australian space startups: Space Machines Company, to launch a 35 kg spacecraft on Eris’s inaugural flight, and Fleet Space Technologies, to carry six nanosatellites in 2023. Gilmour Space has also signed an agreement with U.S.-based Momentus to use its orbital transfer services. The round was led by Fine Structure Ventures and included contributions from Australian VCs Blackbird and Main Sequence, and Australian pension funds HESTA, Hostplus and NGS Super. Blackbird and Main Sequence are returning investors after leading Gilmour’s Series A and Series B, respectively. This is the largest amount of private equity funding ever raised by a space company in Australia, and brings the company’s total amount raised to $87 million AUD ($66 million USD).

Masten’s prototype is being developed as part of a contract awarded through the Air Force Research Laboratory’s AFWERX program. Once deployed, it’ll be a first-of-its-kind off-world navigational system. Up until this point, spacecraft heading to the moon must carry equipment onboard to detect hazards and assist with navigation. To some extent, it makes sense that a shared navigation network has never been established: Humans have only landed on the moon a handful of times, and while there have been many more uncrewed landings, lunar missions still haven’t exactly been a regular occurrence. But as the costs of going to orbit and beyond have drastically decreased, thanks in part to innovations in launch technology by companies like SpaceX, space is likely to get a lot busier. Many private companies and national space divisions have set their sights on the moon in particular. Masten is one of them: It was chosen by NASA to deliver commercial and private payloads to a site near the Haworth Crater at the lunar south pole. That mission , originally scheduled for December 2022, was pushed back to November 2023. Other entities are also looking to go to the moon. Chief amongst them is NASA with its Artemis program , which will send two astronauts to the lunar surface in 2024. These missions will likely only increase in the coming decades, making a common navigation network more of a necessity. “Unlike Earth, the moon isn’t equipped with GPS so lunar spacecraft and orbital assets are essentially operating in the dark,” Masten’s VP of research and development Matthew Kuhns explained in a statement. The system will work like this: Spacecraft will deploy position, navigation and timing (PNT) beacons onto the lunar surface. The PNT beacons will enable a surface-based network that broadcasts a radio signal, allowing spacecraft and other orbital assets to wirelessly connect for navigation, timing and location tracking. The company already concluded Phase I of the project, which involved completing the concept design for the PNT beacons. The bulk of the engineering challenge will come in Phase II, when Masten will develop the PNT beacons. They must be able to withstand harsh lunar conditions, so Masten is partnering with defense and technology company Leidos to build shock-proof beacon enclosures. The aim is to complete the second phase in 2023. “By establishing a shared navigation network on the moon, we can lower spacecraft costs by millions of dollars, increase payload capacity and improve landing accuracy near the most resource-rich sites on the moon,” Kuhns said. 5 fundraising imperatives for robotics startups Topics Reporter, Space and Defense Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/skywatch-raises-17-2m-for-its-earth-observation-data-platform/,SkyWatch raises $17.2M for its Earth observation data platform,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Waterloo-based SkyWatch was among the first startups to recognize that the key to unlocking the real benefits of the space economy lay in making Earth observation data accessible and portable, and now the company has raised a $17.2 million Series B to help it further that goal. Fresh on the heals of a partnership with Poland-based satellite operator SatRevolution, SkyWatch is now set to bridge the gulf between satellite startups and customers in a bigger way as it lowers the barriers to entry for new companies focused on high-tech spacecraft payloads. The new round of funding was led by new investor Drive Capital, and included participation from existing investors including Bullpen Capital, Space Capital, Golden Ventures and BDC Ventures. SkyWatch CEO and co-founder James Slifierz told me that bringing Drive on was a major win for the Series B. “Drive is a firm that has actually been researching the space industry for a few years now, and looking for an opportunity that would be their first space technology investment,” he said. “Not their first in the [GTA-Waterloo] area, they’re based out of Columbus, Ohio, made up of Silicon Valley veterans. They were a little early to the trend of believing that a majority of the really interesting and large opportunities would eventually evolve outside of the Bay Area and outside of New York City.” SkyWatch definitely fits the bill, having built strong revenue pipeline for an Earth observation data platform that makes the information collected by the many observation satellites on orbit accessible to private industry, in a way that doesn’t require re-architecting existing systems or handling huge amounts of data in unfamiliar formats. This fresh funding will help SkyWatch accelerate the rollout of its TerraStream product, a new platform that the company developed to provide full-service data management, ordering, processing and delivery for satellite companies. This allows SkyWatch to not only make data collected by Earth observation satellites like those operated by SatRevolution accessible to customers — but also to source customers for those companies, too, effectively handling both sales and delivery, which many satellite startups born from a technical or academic background don’t start out equipped to tackle. “My favorite analogy for TerraStream is it’s Shopify for space companies,” Slifierz said. “It takes away a lot of the complexity of going to market. So if you want to build an amazing shoe brand today, Shopify enables you to not have to worry about the logistics, and shipping, and the inventory management, the website, storefront and all that; it allows you to focus on the things that will build value in your company, which is the quality of your product, and your brand.” He added that just like Shopify depends on the existence of a rich third-party ecosystem to support its platform, so does SkyWatch, and that ecosystem is only now reaching maturity after years of infrastructure development, including things like the proliferation of launch startups, ground station build out, data warehousing and more. Ultimately, what SkyWatch provides is the ability to go to market “faster and more profitably,” Slifierz says, which is a major shift for hard tech satellite startups working on new and improved sensor capabilities, often spinning out of research labs at academic institutions. “The strongest value proposition is that we give you instant access to hundreds of customers, which we’re growing at a very fast pace on the EarthCache [SkyWatch’s commercial satellite imagery marketplace] side. So in that way, we sort of joke, it’s like Shopify for space, but also integrated with the AWS marketplace.” SkyWatch can also actually help identify demand, by providing satellite-side customers with real data to back up signals of what the market is actually looking for. Slifierz says that’s helped them advise partners on how to tweak their offering to meet a real need, which is beneficial in an industry where research and tech development often lead payload design, with actual demand as a somewhat secondary consideration.

The deal has a post-transaction equity value of $2.8 billion, and will provide Planet with $545 million in cash balance at close, including $345 million from dMY IV’s contribution, and a $200 million PIPE provided by BlackRock-managed funds, Koch Strategic Platforms, Marc Benioff’s TIME Ventures and Google. After a bit of a lull, Planet is now the second significant private space company this week to take the SPAC route to public markets. Both are in the business of Earth observation, though Satellogic, which announced its own SPAC merger on Tuesday, operates on a much smaller scale at the moment. Planet, founded in 2010, has raised around $374 million to date, and operates the largest Earth imaging satellite constellation in operation. The company’s mission has been to transform the way Earth imaging data is collected and provided to commercial interests here on Earth. Planet’s network can provide a complete scan of all of the Earth’s landmass on a daily basis, and it offers that to customers “via a Bloomerg-like terminal for Earth data,” as Planet founder and CEO Wiill Marshall puts it. Access is provided on a subscription basis, and Planet says it generated over $100 million in revenue during its most recent fiscal year, which ended in January. Planet intends to use the funds resulting from the merger in part to pay down its existing debt, and also to fund its existing operations and “support new and existing growth initiatives.” The aim to to complete the merger sometime later this year, at which point the combined entity will trade under the ticker “PL” on the NYSE.

The science mission was awarded through NASA’s Small Innovative Missions for Planetary Exploration (SIMPLEx) program, and will fly to Mars in 2024, aboard a yet-to-be-identified commercial lunch vehicle contracted by NASA as a rideshare rocket. This is a noteworthy development for a few reasons, including that Rocket Lab will realize its earlier announced vision of using Photon as a platform for satellites that travel beyond Earth’s orbit. It’s also interesting because it will ostensibly mark the first decoupling of Rocket Lab’s launch and spacecraft services businesses. Rocket Lab’s Photon is a satellite platform that includes the company’s Curie in-space propulsion system, and they’ll also be outfitted for this mission with star trackers and reaction wheels to make up a situational control system, as well as a deep space navigation system or way finding. The appeal of Photon is meant to be deep space exploration capability in a small, affordable and relatively low mass for launch package that could broaden access to interplanetary science for more organizations and institutions. Next up for the Rocket Lab-supported Escapade mission that will use these two Mars-bound Photons is a design review in June, which will be followed up by a final confirmation review in July as a last check before the Photons are built, equipped and readied for their eventual flight.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/02/ousted-flexport-ceo-dave-clark-strikes-back/,Ousted Flexport CEO Dave Clark strikes back,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Dave Clark, the former Amazon executive who was ousted as CEO of Flexport just a year into the job, fired back at its founder and board, calling recent reporting on the logistics company “deeply concerning.” Clark made the comments Monday in a lengthy post on social media site X following a report from CNBC that provided new information about his last days at Flexport, a freight forwarding and customs brokerage startup valued at $8 billion. Clark, who was handpicked by founder Ryan Petersen to take the top job, said he discovered extensive problems when he joined Flexport in September 2022, including a “revenue forecasting model that was consistently providing overly optimistic outputs.” Flexport could not be reached for comment. TechCrunch will update this article if Flexport responds. The post on X (formerly known as Twitter) reads: Operating with integrity and treating colleagues with respect is critical to the success of any company, which, as a shareholder, makes today’s CNBC story and other recent reporting about Flexport deeply concerning. Despite my short tenure, I care about the company and its employees and want it to succeed. When I joined Flexport as co-CEO in September 2022, I found a company lacking process and financial discipline, including numerous customer-facing issues that resulted in significant lost customers and a revenue forecasting model that was consistently providing overly optimistic outputs. The company had missed cost, margin, and revenue forecasts for multiple quarters prior to my arrival. My go-forward plan for Flexport, which was vetted by Ryan and presented to the Board, was focused on delivering growth and moving to align costs with revenue, not a revenue number based on hope — but one grounded in reality. Although the problems at Flexport were much more extensive than I thought they would be when I agreed to join, I’ve never shied away from a challenge. During my time at Flexport, working alongside a talented team, we successfully transitioned to a new tech and product organizational model, integrated a significant acquisition and rapidly launched an end-to-end supply chain technology product all while simultaneously improving Flexport’s operations and internal processes. Flexport is facing serious internal and industry challenges that require serious leadership, and I sincerely hope they find a successful path. But for me, it’s time to go build something new somewhere else…and then after that who knows. Clark’s sudden departure was just the beginning of upheaval within the company. The comments are the latest in an internal drama between Clark, Petersen and the board that was unfolding behind the scenes this summer, just a few months after the company acquired Shopify’s logistics unit . The issue came to a head in September when Clark was forced out. The internal executive drama didn’t end with Clark’s departure. Two days after Clark abruptly stepped down as CEO, Petersen said Flexport would rescind dozens of employment offers and look to lease out the company’s office space as it looks to get costs under control and “get its house in order,” according to a post on the social media site X. In a separate post, Petersen noted that Flexport has “grade A” office space to sublease in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City and other locations around the world. Petersen’s main complaints around Clark’s leadership — at least on public comments he has made — have centered around costs, specifically hiring and expanding too quickly. However, Clark’s hiring and big “entrepreneurial” vision for Flexport was hardly a secret. Clark was co-CEO alongside Petersen his first six months on the job. Petersen then stepped into an executive chairman role. Topics Transportation Editor LIMITED TIME: Save $300+ on your ticket, plus an additional 50% on a second for a full immersive day of AI!

https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/28/eeoc-sues-tesla-for-racial-discrimination-of-black-workers/,Federal agency sues Tesla for racial discrimination of Black workers,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed suit against Tesla on Thursday, accusing the automaker of violating federal law by tolerating widespread and ongoing racial harassment of its Black employees and subjecting some workers to retaliation for opposing harassment. The lawsuit from the federal agency responsible for enforcing civil rights laws against workplace discrimination is one of several against Tesla for racial bias. The California Civil Rights Department sued Tesla in 2022 over similar allegations. And in April a jury ordered Tesla to pay a Black former worker, Owen Diaz, $3.2 million in damages after Tesla was found to have allowed severe racial harassment at its Fremont assembly plant. In April 2022, Tesla revealed in a financial filing that the EEOC had an “open investigation” into the company. Tesla had engaged in a mandatory conciliation process with the agency. That process was not successful, which led to the lawsuit filed Thursday. The EEOC alleges that since at least 2015 until present day, Black employees at that same factory have endured “severe or pervasive racial harassment” and “a hostile work environment.” Specifically, the filing details the stereotyping and hostility, such as being called “lazy,” “smelly” and “always late.” They also claim to have endured slurs and epithets such as variations of the N-word, “monkey,” “boy,” and “black bitch.” The lawsuit alleges that these slurs were used casually and in high-traffic areas and worker hubs. “I saw KKK epithets, a swastika, and the N-Word all over the bathroom,” one Black worker was quoted as saying in the lawsuit. “It was so gross and racist I don’t want to discuss it. It would say ‘kill black people,’ ‘kill N-Words,’ ‘hang black people,’ ‘hang N-Words.’” The Black workers who spoke to EEOC said such graffiti, which also included images of nooses, could be found on a variety of surfaces, including on desks, in elevators, and on equipment, including vehicles rolling off production lines. “Supervisors and managers witnessed racially offensive conduct but failed or refused to intercede,” reads the lawsuit. “Black employees reported the slurs, insults, graffiti and misconduct to Tesla’s human resources, employee relations, and managerial personnel . . . Tesla failed and refused to take steps to address the behavior.” Furthermore, Tesla allegedly fired Black employees within weeks of them reporting or opposing racial harassment. “After I voiced my unhappiness [about the harassment], I started getting written up for every little thing that was acceptable before like listening to music while working,” recounts one Black worker. The lawsuit accuses Tesla of violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, amended in 1991, which calls on employers to correct unlawful practices based on race and to provide appropriate relief to aggrieved individuals. “When you let a standard slip, you’ve set a new standard. Determining that prolific racial slurs do not merit serious discipline and failing to correct harassing conduct sends an entirely wrong message to employees,” said Nancy Sienko, the EEOC’s San Francisco district office director, in a statement. “It also violates an employer’s legal responsibility to act swiftly and effectively to stop race-based harassment.” Tesla disbanded its press department in 2020 and could not be reached for comment. The EEOC requests a jury trial and asks that the court order Tesla to pay damages to the aggrieved individuals, as well as fines for breaking the law. The agency also requests the court to grant a permanent injunction to Tesla management that engaged in and allowed racism to flourish and to order Tesla to institute and carry out policies to remedy the situation and protect Black workers in the future. The lawsuit — EEOC v Tesla, Inc., Case No 4:23-cv-04984 — was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

As NASA prepares for the next crewed mission to the moon, it’s looking to give the lunar rover an upgrade. Lockheed Martin and General Motors said Wednesday they’re working together to develop a next-generation lunar vehicle designed to be faster and capable of traveling farther distances than its predecessor. If the project is selected by NASA, the rover would be used on the upcoming Artemis missions. The first mission, which will be an uncrewed test flight, is scheduled for November. The request for proposals will likely be published in the third or fourth quarter of this year, executives said at a media briefing Wednesday. NASA will award the contract after evaluating the submitted proposals. The previous rover was only capable of traveling less than five miles from the Apollo landing site, limiting the astronauts’ ability to collect important data on far-flung lunar locales, like the north and south poles. The moon’s circumference is nearly 7,000 miles. The two companies are aiming to improve the specs, Lockheed’s VP for lunar exploration Kirk Shireman said, noting that the exact materials used for the new rover, its range and other capabilities have yet to be determined. GM will also be developing an autonomous driving system for the rover, which executives said Wednesday will improve safety and the ability for astronauts to collect samples and conduct other scientific research. GM is investing more than $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicle technologies through 2025, and it aims to bring that research to the lunar rover project, Jeffrey Ryder, VP of growth and strategy at GM Defense, said. “We’re heads-down right now in investigating how we would take those capabilities and apply them to specific missions and operation associated with the Artemis program.” GM also said it will be using its earth-bound research into battery and propulsion systems in developing the rover. Ryder anticipates that the rover program will lead to other market opportunities. 9 top space tech VCs on the market’s opportunities and challenges Both companies have supplied technology for NASA missions before, including its lunar missions. Auto manufacturer GM helped develop the lunar rover that was used during the Apollo era, including its chassis and wheels. It also manufactured and integrated guidance and navigational systems for the program. Aerospace giant Lockheed Martin’s experience extends to building spacecraft and power systems that have been included on every NASA mission to Mars. The companies said this was “one of several initiatives” they’re working on together, with further announcements regarding other projects expected in the future.

OroraTech is a German startup building a constellation of small satellites to power a global wildfire warning system, and will be using a freshly raised €5.8 million (~$7 million) A round to kick things off. Wildfires destroy tens of millions of acres of forest every year, causing immense harm to people and the planet in countless ways. Once they’ve grown to a certain size, they’re near impossible to stop, so the earlier they can be located and worked against, the better. But these fires can start just about anywhere in a dried out forest hundreds of miles wide, and literally every minute and hour counts — watch towers, helicopter flights and other frequently used methods may not be fast or exact enough to effectively counteract this increasingly serious threat. Not to mention they’re expensive and often dangerous jobs for those who perform them. OroraTech’s plan is to use a constellation of about 100 satellites equipped with custom infrared cameras to watch the entire globe (or at least the parts most likely to burst into flame) at once, reporting any fire bigger than 10 meters across within half an hour. To start out with, the Bavarian company has used data from over a dozen satellites already in space, in order to prove out the service on the ground. But with this funding round they are set to put their own bird in the air, a shoebox-sized satellite with a custom infrared sensor that will be launched by Spire later this year. Onboard machine learning processing of this imagery simplifies the downstream process. Fourteen more satellites are planned for launch by 2023, presumably once they’ve kicked the proverbial tires on the first one and come up with the inevitable improvements. “In order to cover even more regions in the future and to be able to give warning earlier, we aim to launch our own specialized satellite constellation into orbit,” said CEO and co-founder Thomas Grübler in a press release. “We are therefore delighted to have renowned investors on board to support us with capital and technological know-how in implementing our plans.” Those renowned investors consist of Findus Venture and Ananda Impact Ventures, which led the round, followed by APEX Ventures, BayernKapital, Clemens Kaiser, SpaceTec Capital and Ingo Baumann. The company was spun out of research done by the founders at TUM, which maintains an interest. “It is absolutely remarkable what they have built up and achieved so far despite limited financial resources and we feel very proud that we are allowed to be part of this inspiring and ambitious NewSpace project,” APEX’s Wolfgang Neubert said, and indeed it’s impressive to have a leading space-based data service with little cash (it raised an undisclosed seed about a year ago) and no satellites. It’s not the only company doing infrared imagery of the Earth’s surface; SatelliteVu recently raised money to launch its own, much smaller constellation, though it’s focused on monitoring cities and other high-interest areas, not the vast expanse of forests. And ConstellR is aimed (literally) at the farming world, monitoring fields for precision crop management. With money in its pocket Orora can expand and start providing its improved detection services, though sadly, it likely won’t be upgrading before wildfire season hits the northern hemisphere this year.

Blue Ghost will hop a ride with a rocket from a different launch company — SpaceX — in 2023, the companies announced today. While Firefly Aerospace is in the process of developing its own launch vehicles, the company is still looking forward to its first orbital flight of its Alpha rocket, which is not a rocket capable of taking large payloads to the moon. SpaceX, meanwhile, hasn’t yet sent a Falcon 9 on a lunar mission, but it has flown a lot of successful missions, and its specs allow for moon deliveries, with many other commercial lunar lander developers selecting the vehicle as their launch vehicle of choice. NASA issues new call for lunar payload deliveries from its commercial moon lander partners Firefly’s Blue Ghost aims to fly in just a couple years’ time, and it’s tasked with carrying 10 payloads on behalf of NASA as part of their Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. NASA is using that program to award private companies missions to carry experiments to the moon’s surface, in part as preparation for the forthcoming Artemis human moon exploration (and, eventually, long-term habitation) missions. SpaceX got the nod in part because the Falcon 9’s performance specs mean the Blue Ghost can conserve more of its own fuel, making it possible for the lander to take on around 150 kg (330 lbs) of cargo. Firefly, like many other CLPS providers, also intends to take up payloads alongside the NASA experiments from other commercial entities, selling off that space to make more revenue. The first lander launching under CLPS is scheduled to fly sometime in the fourth quarter of this year, and a total of six are currently awarded and planned for tentative launches through 2023.

Electric propulsion systems are effective at moving spacecraft from lower to higher orbits, even to the moon, Astra Chief Engineer Benjamin Lyon said in a blog post Monday, pointing to Astra’s plans beyond missions to Earth’s orbit. Under the terms of the deal, Astra will buy Apollo for $30 million in stock and $20 million in cash, for a total purchase price of $50 million. There is also the potential for an additional earn-out of up to $95 million if Apollo hits certain performance benchmarks. PJT Partners is acting as financial advisor to Astra with regard to the transaction, the Alameda-based launch startup said Monday. Astra CEO Chris Kemp has been forthright about his goal of making the company a vertically integrated launch and space services provider, and Apollo’s thruster technology is a major piece of that puzzle. Astra successfully launched its first test rocket from Kodiak, Alaska last December, but in public statements Kemp has indicated plans for monthly commercial launches. Why Astra built a space startup and rocket factory in Silicon Valley Apollo produces two EP thruster systems, the Apollo Constellation Engine (ACE) and the ACE Max. Both are compatible with krypton or xenon propellants. The company said it had been selected by York Space Systems as the propulsion system provider for a LEO satellite constellation program that will be launched in 2022. The transaction between Astra and Apollo will close after Astra’s merger with special purpose acquisition company Holicity is completed later this year.

All four of these flights will be for Axiom, a private commercial spaceflight and space station company, and they’re set to take place between early next year through 2023. SpaceX’s Crew Dragon and Falcon 9 spacecraft make up the first commercial launch system certified for transporting humans to the ISS, and they’ve already delivered three groups of NASA astronauts to the orbital lab, including one demo crew for its final qualification test, and two operational crews to live and work on the station. In May, Axiom and NASA revealed the details of their AX-1 mission, the first all-private launch to the ISS, which will carry four passengers to the station on a Crew Dragon to live and work in space for a duration of eight days in total. NASA and SpaceX will be providing training to all four of the Axiom crews set to make the trip to the station. And while neither SpaceX nor Axiom has shared more details yet on what the other three missions will entail, or when they’re set to take place, four missions in two years technically absorbs all the existing capacity NASA has allocated for private astronaut missions, which is set at two per year, for 2022 and 2023. Axiom Space and NASA detail first fully private human launch to the Space Station, set for January 2022 One private astronaut flight to the ISS is already set for 2021: Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa booked a ride to the station aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket for early December. Maezawa booked through Space Adventures, which has already provided a handful of trips for deep-pocketed private astronauts over the course of the past couple of decades. Axiom meanwhile envisions a somewhat less niche, and more continually active, future for commercial orbital space stations. The company is already working on a commercial module to be added to the existing ISS, and has designs on building a fully private successor to the station in future. Booking four trips with multiple crew members in two years goes a long way towards showing there’s more than just very sporadic demand from eccentric rich people for this kind of offering.

But for a touch of luxury, Kolors puts one of its own employees on board each bus to check passengers in, accept cash payments when needed and sell snacks and drinks. The purchase of Urbvan, which was previously owned by a Dubai-based Kolors competitor Swvl, brings a door-to-door solution to Kolors’ service in Mexico. Urbvan has a similarly asset-light business model, with over 500 vans and shuttles on its platforms and hundreds of B2B clients. The acquisition will allow Kolors to connect business travelers not just between cities, but within cities to corporate offices, business parks, factories and distribution centers. The combined service will be available in 40 cities across Mexico. At present, Urbvan operates in 24 cities across the country, from Tijuana to Cancún. “Not only is Urbvan in great shape, but the main reason for the acquisition was to complement Kolors’s digital mass mobility ecosystem and offer our millions of passengers complementary mobility alternatives, especially when 30% of Kolors passengers travel for work and the tickets are paid by an employer (a potential B2B client); and all of Urbvan’s passengers are potential travelers for the Kolors intercity bus ecosystem,” Martínez told TechCrunch via email. When Kolors launches its app at the end of 2023, it will merge both its intercity and van services. Until then, the Urbvan app will continue functioning as a standalone app, according to Martínez. The executive said Kolors used the money from an undisclosed pre-Series B round to fund the Urbvan purchase. The company also said the round doubled its valuation, which is “now in the 9-figures.” Urbvan is already a profitable and growing business, according to Martínez, so it’s not entirely clear why Swvl would decide to sell. The company acquired Urbvan in July 2022 to expand its reach into Mexico, but sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch Swvl has been selling off parts of its business internationally for the past year as it struggles to stay afloat. Swvl went public in 2021 through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, a move that has all but become synonymous with failure in the transportation industry and beyond. Lordstown Motors , Arrival , Nikola, Lucid Motors and Bird have all gone public via SPAC, and are all hanging on by a thread. In January, Swvl issued a reverse stock split to attempt to bring its share price back up to $1 after it had received a warning from the Nasdaq. Swvl’s stock closed Tuesday at $1.03, down from its opening highs of $250 per share. Swvl did not reply in time to TechCrunch to clarify the reason for its sale. Meanwhile, Kolors has raised $20 million publicly and has strong backers including Toyota Ventures, Up Ventures, Tuesday Capital, Maniv Mobility and Uber co-founder Garrett Camp. The company is also riding the wave of onshoring in Mexico, or at least it hopes to. After expanding its service with Urbvan, Kolors expects to transport more than 5 million passengers by the end of 2023. In 2024 and beyond, Kolors aims to tap even more business clients who will be coming to Mexico in droves as a range of companies, including Tesla , begin building factories in the North American country — the industrial answer to persistent COVID-19 bottlenecks, geopolitical tensions between U.S. and China, and supply chain issues associated with the Russia-Ukraine war. Kolors estimates it will achieve over $100 million in annualized revenue within 12 to 18 months as a result of the acquisition. In the future, Kolors hopes to tap Urbvan’s existing client base to expand into the U.S. and other regions by late 2024.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/19/bird-acquires-spin-scooters-from-tier-for-19m/,Bird acquires Spin scooters from Tier for $19M,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Shared micromobility company Bird has acquired competitor Spin from Tier for $19 million, including $10 million in cash, $6 million in a vendor take back and $3 million as a hold back. Tier had purchased Spin from Ford back in March 2022 to expand its presence in the U.S., but Tier has struggled to maintain its lead and reach profitability. The company raised a convertible note round in May as it searched for a buyer. There have been reports that Voi , a micromobility operator out of Sweden, is in talks to buy Tier. Tier will remain a separate entity with its own app, according to a company-wide email sent to Tier employees and viewed by TechCrunch. The email described the change as similar to when Tier purchased Spin from Ford, “the main change is that Spin is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Bird Rides Inc.” The news that Bird, another operator struggling to reach profitability or even sustainability, is buying Spin is surprising. Bird closed out its second quarter with negative free cash flow of -$1.8 million, but that gap is starting to close as the company slashes costs. Bird says the transaction is expected to have upwards of $20 million in synergies and will add immediate growth to its earnings, in part due to recent operational restructuring. In August, Bird replaced its CEO Shane Torchiana with Michael Washinushi, formerly CFO, as interim CEO. Spin delivered about $45 million in net revenue in the 12 months ending in June 30, 2023, which brings Bird and Spin’s combined net revenue to $265 million for that period. Spin has operations in more than 50 cities and university campuses, and Bird says the overlap is minimal. The acquisition gives Bird a larger geographic footprint. Another puzzling outcome, considering Bird in October 2022 exited several dozen U.S. cities in order to downsize. Bird says it will use the acquisition to expand in cities like Baltimore, Salt Lake City and Washington D.C. “Spin is a great financial and strategic acquisition for Bird and we expect this acquisition will enable us to achieve long term sustainable profitability. In addition to our overall market leadership in North America, the company now holds a leading market share position in key markets, more new vehicles, cutting-edge technology and a significantly stronger financial position,” said Washinushi in a statement. “Bird and Spin have many strategic synergies, which we believe will have an immediate impact in the third quarter.” The buy adds Spin’s fleet of over 60,000 vehicles under Bird’s purview, including many newer models with battery swapping capabilities — something Bird has lagged on that has had an effect on its efficiency and bottom line. Many of Spin’s fleet also use Drover AI’s sidewalk detection technologies. Most of Bird’s fleet in the U.S. is run by contractors, or “fleet managers.” Part of Bird’s previous strategic mission to become more sustainable was to bring more fleet managers in-house. Bird says it does not plan to change Spin’s operating model at all. The company-wide email sent to Tier employees said that with the exception of a small number of employees, no personnel decisions are being taken and no market closures are happening in the immediate term. This story has been updated to include information from a Tier company-wide email.

The launch startup also announced that it intends to raise another $300 million later in 2021, after its forthcoming inaugural Alpha rocket launch, which is currently targeting a June take-off. Firefly is one of a crop of new commercial launch providers aiming to follow in the footsteps of SpaceX and Rocket Lab, with a goal of serving the growing small satellite launch market. The company has been developing its Alpha rocket for the past few years, and has also been awarded commercial and civil government launch contracts from NASA, General Atomics and others. The Texas-based startup has had its share of setbacks, including the bankruptcy of its original iteration, Firefly Space Systems, which was subsequently re-born as Firefly Aerospace as a wholly owned venture bankrolled by Noosphere Ventures. The company’s second life also includes a redesigned Alpha vehicle that has more launch capacity, with the ability to carry 1000kg to low Earth orbit, or 600kg to sun-synchronous orbit. It’s also developing a lunar lander called “Blue Ghost,” in order to provide lunar payload delivery services for NASA as part of its Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. Firefly does appear closer than ever to actually flying its launch vehicle, with preparations already significantly advanced at its launch facility in Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. The June window for its debut flight is rapidly approaching, and the company is clearly hoping to use the momentum from that demonstration to boost interest for its next big raise, since it’s declaring its intentions ahead of time (while also claiming this Series A round was “oversubscribed.”) The Series A was led by DADA Holdings, and includes participation by Astera Institute, Canon Ball LLC and others. The secondary generated from the sale of Noosphere holdings also included Series A participants, as well as “other investors” according to Firefly.

https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/spacex-launches-60-more-starlink-satellites/,SpaceX launches 60 more Starlink satellites,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us SpaceX has launched another batch of Starlink satellites, adding 60 more to the constellation on orbit. This is the 24th Starlink launch in total, and means SpaceX has now sent up more than 1,500 Starlink spacecraft, with around 1,438 of those still in operation. This is the first Starlink launch since April 7 — which, surprisingly, is the biggest gap between these launches in quite a while. This year, SpaceX’s overall launch calendar has been dominated by Starlink launches, as the company seeks to expand the availability, quality and coverage of its low Earth orbit broadband internet network. SpaceX also opened up availability of Starlink service this year, and now seems to be mostly supply-constrained on the consumer receiver terminal side, rather than necessarily on network capacity or regional ability. Regarding that few week gap in the Starlink launch pace, it’s not like SpaceX was slacking in the meantime; the launcher sent up its second crew of astronauts destined for the International Space Station in a flight just last week . Plus, it has two or three additional Starlink launches tentatively scheduled to happen in May. SpaceX successfully launches astronauts with a re-used Dragon spacecraft for the first time This latest launch took off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 11:44 PM EDT (8:44 PM PDT) on Wednesday, and used a flight-proven Falcon 9 first-stage booster, which was used on six prior missions, including four Starlink launches.

This marked the 10th flight of the first-stage rocket booster used for the launch, which sets a record for reuse for SpaceX as the rocket booster with the most successful mission under its belt. The launch took place at 2:42 a.m. EDT, flying from Cape Canaveral in Florida. SpaceX also successfully returned the booster to its drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean for a tenth successful landing for the rocket, too, making it a record-setter in that regard as well, and setting up the possibility that it could fly yet again. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said it could be “possible” for a Falcon 9 booster to fly “100+” times with servicing and component replacement. This Falcon 9 has previously flown on missions including the original uncrewed demonstration mission of Crew Dragon, SpaceX’s astronaut spacecraft, and seven prior Starlink launches. SpaceX has shown just how reusable its rockets are with its aggressive Starlink launch schedule, most of which have employed rocket boosters that have flown a number of missions before, including other launches for the broadband internet megaconstellation. Since SpaceX is both launch provider and customer on Starlink, it’s actually crucial for the company to realize as many cost savings as possible during its frequent flights building the network of low-Earth orbit satellites. Reuse of the boosters is a key ingredient, and one where the cost savings definitely accrue over time. Musk has previously said that the economics are such that for its external customer flights, it’s at about “even” on the second use of a booster, and “ahead” in terms of costs by the third. During its Starlink launch program, SpaceX has repeatedly set and broken its own reusability records, indicating a key means of keeping the costs of building out its in-space satellite infrastructure is using flight-proven boosters as much as possible. This is the 27th Starlink launch thus far, and SpaceX has another planned just six days from now on May 15, with at least one more likely in the works for later this month after that. The company hopes to have its broadband network built out to the point where it has global reach by the end of this year.

The Dragon took off aboard a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 5:49 AM EDT (2:49 AM EDT). On board were four astronauts, including NASA’s Megan McArthur and Shane Kimbrough, as well as JAXA’s Akihiko Hoshide and the ESA’s Thomas Pesquet. This was Spacex’s second official astronaut delivery mission for NASA, after its Crew-1 operation last year. Unlike Crew-1, Crew-2 included use of two re-flown components in the spacecraft system, including the first-stage booster, which was used during the Crew-1 launch, and the Dragon capsule, which was used for SpaceX’s first-ever human spaceflight, the final demonstration mission of its spacecraft certification program for NASA, which flew Bob Behnken (side note: this mission’s pilot, McArthur, is Behnken’s wife) and Doug Hurley to the ISS. SpaceX has characterized the use of re-flown elements as arguably even safer than using new ones, with CEO Elon Musk noting that you wouldn’t want to be on the “first flight of an airplane when it comes out of the factory” during a conversation with Xprize’s Peter Diamandis on Thursday evening. Now that the Crew Dragon is in its target transfer orbit, it’ll be making its way to rendezvous with the Space Station, which will take just under 24 hours. It’ll be docking with the station early tomorrow morning, attaching to a docking port that was just cleared earlier this month when SpaceX’s other Crew Dragon relocated to another port on the ISS earlier this month. This launch also included a recovery attempt for the booster, with a landing at sea using SpaceX’s drone landing pad. That went as planned, meaning this booster, which has already flown two different sets of human astronauts, could be used to fly yet another after refurbishment. SpaceX’s Commercial Crew program with NASA continues to be the key success story in the agency’s move to partner with more private companies for its research and space exploration missions. NASA also recently tapped SpaceX to develop the human landing system for its Artemis program , which will return humans to the moon for the first time since the Apollo program, and which will use SpaceX’s Starship spacecraft. For SpaceX’s human spaceflight program, the next big milestone will be its first flight of a mission made up entirely of paying private citizens, which is currently set to take place this fall .

The Axiom Mission 1 spaceflight mission will ferry four private astronauts to the International Space Station in January 2022. The eight-day mission will be launched from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida using a SpaceX Crew Dragon. While in space, the crew will be living and working in the U.S. segment of the ISS. NASA will be paying Axiom $1.69 million for services associated with the mission, such as transporting supplies to the ISS, though that does not include other reimbursable agreements between the two entities. There’s a “high degree of confidence in the late January date” for the launch, Axiom CEO Michael Suffredini said. Axiom in January released the identity of the crew members: Canadian investor Mark Pathy, investor Larry Connor and former Israeli pilot Eytan Stibbe. Leading the crew as mission commander is former NASA astronaut and Axiom Space VP Michael López-Alegría, who has four spaceflights under his belt. Pathy, Connor and Stibbe will engage in research missions while onboard. Pathy will be collaborating with the Montreal Children’s Hospital and the Canadian Space Agency; Connor, the Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic; and Stibbe will conduct scientific experiments coordinated by the Israel Space Agency at the Ministry of Science and Technology. “Larry and Mark are very serious individuals who are dedicated to being the best they can be in the mold of a NASA astronaut and they’re not interested in being tourists,” López-Alegría said during the media briefing. “They want to do their part to improve humankind.” To prepare for the mission, the four crew members will go on a “camping trip” in the Alaskan foothills for training in July, López-Alegría said. He will start full-time training around August, with Larry starting in September. The rest of the crew will start in October, with around two-thirds of their time dedicated to ISS-specific training and the rest dedicated to training with SpaceX. The staggered schedule is due to the differing responsibilities between the crew members while onboard. Axiom will be using the same contractor that NASA uses to train its astronauts. While Suffredini declined to specify how much the private astronauts paid for their space on the flight, he said he “wouldn’t argue with” widely reported figures in the tens of millions. The Washington Post in January reported that the ticket prices came in at $55 million each. Prices may not always be so high, but Suffredini said that the industry is likely at least a decade away from serious price drops that might make space travel feasible for the average space-goer. Axiom intends to offer astronaut flights — both private and national — to the International Space Station and eventually its own privately funded space station. While Axiom has “things lined up” for AX-2, AX-3 and AX-4, “like everyone we have to compete for the opportunity,” Suffredini said. The number of missions to the ISS is limited because there are only two docking ports on the ISS, Station deputy manager Dana Weigel added. That suggests that additional stations will be necessary to meet the burgeoning demand for both commercial and scientific space missions. Axiom Space raises $130 million for its commercial space station ambitions The company also in January 2020 won a NASA contract to develop and install a commercial module to the Harmony docking port of the ISS as early as 2024. Phil McAlister, NASA’s director of commercial spaceflight development, said that recent announcements on commercial spaceflights from Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic in addition to the Axiom mission have heralded “a renaissance in U.S. human spaceflight.” “A lot of times history can feel incremental when you’re in it, but I really feel like we are in it this year. This is a real inflection point with human spaceflight,” he said.

Now it appears that proposal is getting a second wind. The state’s attorney general, Andrea Campbell, on Wednesday approved backers of the ballot measure to begin collecting the tens of thousands of signatures for the measure to appear on the November 2024 ballot after certifying the questions met constitutional requirements. Campbell also greenlit a competing ballot initiative from the union SEIU Local 32BJ that would allow drivers to unionize and bargain collectively for better working conditions and compensation. The dueling proposals encapsulate the crux of the gig worker question. The app-based gig companies supporting the ballot initiative to keep gig workers as independent contractors argue that such a classification will enable the workers to maintain the flexible work schedules they value. Labor rights activists backing the union proposal argue companies have been failing to provide proper worker protections and benefits like workers’ compensation or even a basic human wage. One 2021 study found workers in Massachusetts could earn $4.82 per hour if the previous ballot measure passed. The proposal filed in August by Flexibility and Benefits for Massachusetts Drivers 2024 — a group backed by Uber, Lyft and DoorDash — that would classify gig workers as contractors is similar to a ballot proposal that passed in California in 2020 called Proposition 22 . It would establish an earnings floor equal to 120% of the state’s minimum wage for app-based drivers, or $18 an hour in 2023 before tips. Drivers would also get healthcare stipends, occupational accident insurance and paid sick time, although experts and drivers in California who have spoken to TechCrunch say it’s difficult, if not impossible, to qualify for those benefits. The way app-based companies define hourly rates is also a subject of contention — they count only the hours a worker is actively pursuing a gig, like driving to a pickup and dropping off a passenger, as billable hours. This means the hours workers spend waiting for a gig go unpaid. Ride-hail and delivery work can be dangerous as well. Drivers have complained about being robbed and assaulted, and some have been killed on the job , and they often get no recourse or compensation from companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash. “We’re pleased that the attorney general’s office has certified our ballot proposals to ensure drivers can maintain the flexibility to work when, how often, and for how long they want as independent contractors, while also accessing new benefits and protections,” Conor Yunits, a spokesperson for Flexibility and Benefits for Massachusetts Drivers, said in a statement. The proposal mirrors a similar one that was thrown out by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in 2022, after previous attorney general Maura Healey had similarly approved the initiative for signature collection. The court found that the ballot initiative violated state law and was therefore ineligible to put to voters. At the time, Justice Scott Kafker said the coalition included a vaguely worded, unrelated proposal to limit companies’ liability for accidents by their drivers. The industry-backed initiative may face similar challenges making it to the ballot, but it also has the potential to save Uber and Lyft from a lawsuit. Campbell’s office is scheduled in May to take the companies to trial over claims that they have misclassified their drivers as contractors. In California, Prop 22 brought this issue into sharp focus on a national stage three years go. A California judge ruled in 2021 that the measure violated the state’s constitution, but a state appeals court in March upheld the measure .

https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/07/softbank-group-backs-former-argo-ai-founders-on-new-self-driving-trucks-startup/,SoftBank Group backs former Argo AI founders on new self-driving trucks startup Stack AV,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us There’s a new self-driving trucks startup in town. And the faces are familiar. Bryan Salesky, Peter Rander and Brett Browning — the trio behind the now defunct Ford and VW-backed autonomous vehicle startup Argo AI — have formed a new company called Stack AV that’s focused on commercializing self-driving trucks. SoftBank Group is the sole investor in the endeavor. SoftBank Group didn’t disclose the financial terms of the investment except to say it is providing Stack AV with “capital, resources, and deep expertise in AI to help accelerate its growth and technological developments.” SoftBank Group is also on the Stack AV board. Bloomberg reported that SoftBank Group invested $1 billion . It should be noted that the investment is coming from SoftBank Group, not the SoftBank Vision Fund, which invested in several AV companies, including Aurora, Cruise, Didi Autonomous, Nuro and Robotic Research. GM bought in 2022 SoftBank Vision Fund’s stake in Cruise for $2.1 billion. The launch of Stack AV and its considerable backing is a stunning turnaround for the former Argo AI founders. Just 11 months ago, Argo AI was forced to shut down after Ford and VW pulled their support. The abrupt closure was shocking to many who considered Argo one of the leaders in the AV industry. It also illustrated a shift among some automakers — desperate to find new sources of revenue — away from autonomous vehicle technology and toward trying to monetize advanced driver assistance systems that are found in today’s modern cars, trucks and SUVs. Salesky, who is CEO of Stack AV, told TechCrunch he and his fellow co-founders took a little time off after Argo shuttered. But he was soon back and thinking about how to commercialize autonomous vehicle technology. “We had a number of discussions in the early stages and realized pretty quickly that we were aligned in terms of what a good entry point would be for autonomous vehicles in the trucking use case,” he said in an interview Thursday. “And we also recognized the huge lift that a backer like SoftBank would give us to be able to not just build the technology, but to also be able to scale out the business. None of these businesses will be successful if we can’t scale them out.” For now, Salesky along with Rander, who is president, and Browning, who is chief technology officer, are focused on hiring and getting test vehicles on the road. Stack AV employs 150 people across its Pittsburgh headquarters and 15 states via remote work. Stack AV has tested its technology in trucks, according to Salesky. The trucks have a human safety operator behind the wheel and, for now, are mostly being used for data collection. Salesky and Kentaro Matsui, head of the new business office at SoftBank Group and managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, are clearly bullish on self-driving trucks and more broadly, AI. “The next decade will be defined by AI, where all social systems will be linked by this technology to solve the most complex societal issues,” Matsui said in a statement. “By applying the strengths of AI-powered technology to the trucking industry, Stack AV will fundamentally change the transportation of goods and supply chains across the globe.” That doesn’t mean it will be easy, however. A number of companies that were trying to commercialize self-driving trucks have folded, including Embark. TuSimple, once considered a leader in this specific use case, has been plagued by internal drama and may sell its U.S. business and shift its resources to China . Waymo recently shut down its trucking program to focus on robotaxis. Today, privately held Kodiak Robotics and publicly traded Aurora are the two main contenders applying AV technology to Class 8 trucks. Salesky said despite the consolidation in the sector, he’s confident that Stack AV will be successful because of their experience and SoftBank Group’s involvement. “We have a really experienced team that I think can see around the corners of what works and what doesn’t both in the business model and in various tech approaches,” he told TechCrunch. “I think if you look at the companies that do still exist on the playing field, they have experienced teams, right? We have an experienced team and we also have a backer that is all in on all things related to AI. They believe that AI is the forefront of a revolution and changing all sorts of businesses. It will change them for the better, it will create new businesses, new industries and ultimately will propel humanity forward. And self driving is one of those applications where it has the ability to truly make lives better, and that’s what we’re all that’s what we’re all behind right now.” Topics Transportation Editor LIMITED TIME: Save $300+ on your ticket, plus an additional 50% on a second for a full immersive day of AI!

https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/weather-platform-climacell-is-now-tomorrow-io-and-raises-77m/,Weather platform ClimaCell is now Tomorrow.io and raises $77M,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Weather intelligence platform ClimaCell today announced that it has raised a $77 million Series D funding round led by private equity firm Stonecourt Capital , with participation by Highline Capital. This brings the company’s total funding to about $185 million. In addition to the new funding, ClimaCell announced that it has changed its name to Tomorrow.io, with “The Tomorrow Companies Inc.” as its new legal name. Today’s announcement comes only a month after the company announced that it would launch a fleet of small radar-equipped weather satellites to improve its weather monitoring and forecasting capabilities. That’s also, at least in part, where the name change comes from. Originally, ClimaCell/Tomorrow.io built out a novel technology to collect weather data using wireless network infrastructure and IoT devices. That’s where the “cell” in ClimaCell came from. But as the company’s CEO and co-founder Shimon Elkabetz told me, while the company isn’t abandoning this approach, its focus today is much broader. “The mission is really to help countries, businesses, organizations, to better manage their weather-related challenges,” he said. “And the ambition was always to be that largest weather enterprise in the world, the most disruptive, the most industry-defining. And I think this is the perfect timing for us to come up with a new name, not only because of the funding but because we were able to explain to ourselves that really, we’re helping others take control of tomorrow, today.” ClimaCell plans to launch its own satellites to improve its weather predictions That’s something Stonecourt partner Rick Davis agrees with. “While the company’s growth has been tremendous since launch, there is a larger opportunity at play here,” he said. “What Tomorrow.io is building, corroborated by their recent announcement of launching radar-equipped satellites into space, is only further proof that this company represents the future of weather forecasting for the entire planet. The privatization of the weather industry is now, and that type of vision is what compels the team here at Stonecourt Capital.” As Elkabetz noted, Tomorrow.io isn’t a typical investment for a private investment firm like Stonecourt. Last year, the firm acquired 365 Data Centers , but it is also backing the Denver-based freight rail company Alpenglow Rail, for example. And while many of Tomorrow.io’s customers saw their business decline during the pandemic (the company counts Uber and Delta among its users, for example), Elkabetz tells me that its team focused on diversifying its customer base and managed to sign up a number of large logistics companies, including major railways in the U.S. and Mexico, but also smaller companies in the drone, autonomous driving and electric vehicle space. In total, the company says, it saw a 200% net revenue retention rate and its annual contract value grew 850% during the past two years. The company plans to use the new funding to launch more satellites, but also to improve its overall product and accelerate its go-to-market activities. “We’re an interesting company because we’re a SaaS company that is now going to space,” Elkabetz said. “A lot of the Earth observations companies are now scratching their heads and saying, ‘Oh, we can’t just sell observations, it’s not monetizable or becoming a commodity. We now need to become a software company and build the platform and do the analytics.’ Good luck.” Deep Science: Using machine learning to study anatomy, weather and earthquakes Topics Editor LIMITED TIME: Save $300+ on your ticket, plus an additional 50% on a second for a full immersive day of AI!

Chamath Palihapitiya, who serves as the chairman of Virgin Galactic’s board, still holds 6.2% ownership in the company in partnership with investor Ian Osborne, but his solo holdings are now at zero. Palihapitiya provided the following statement to TechCrunch via Virgin Galactic: I sold 6M shares for $200M which I am planning to redirect into a large investment I am making towards fighting climate change. The details of this investment will be made public in the next few months. I remain as dedicated as ever to Virgin Galactic’s team, mission and prospects. Palihapitiya sold 3.8 million shares in December 2020, noting that he was selling that equity “to help manage [his] liquidity” in order to provide funding for “several new projects starting in 2021.” At the time, Palihapitiya said he “remained committed and excited fore the future of SPCE [Virgin Galactic’s stock ticker on the NYSE].” Please note that I filed a Form 4 for the sale of 3.8M shares of SPCE. I sold these shares to help manage my liquidity as I fund several new projects starting in 2021. I remain committed and excited for the future of SPCE. Just wanted to be transparent. https://t.co/OsUaVgVwKF — Chamath Palihapitiya (@chamath) December 17, 2020 The sale this week comprised 6.2 million shares, netting Palihapitiya roughly $213 million in the process. Virgin Galactic has had some setbacks in its testing program that pushed the projected date of its first paying commercial tourists flights out into 2022, from an earlier target of sometime this year. The company installed Disney Parks leader Michael Colglazier as its new CEO last July, replacing George Whitesides, who moved into a chief space officer role, before it was revealed Thursday that he’s departing the company . Whitesides’ decision is said to be due to a desire to pursue public service opportunities. Space as a sector has been a hotbed of SPAC activity of late, with mergers from a number of companies including Astra, Spire, Rocket Lab, BlackSky and Momentus announced over the course of the past year. Virgin Galactic, as one of the earliest, will be closely watched by anyone looking for a yardstick by which to measure the tactic. The company’s share value is down just over 5% pre-market, and has been on a steady decline since reaching an all-time peak around mid-February.

Astroscale’s demonstrator package includes two separate payloads: a servicer that represents its future production spacecraft and a “client” satellite that’s meant to represent the debris satellites it’ll be de-orbiting on behalf of customers in the future. The Astrocale payload was launched via a Soyuz rocket that took off early this morning from Kazakhstan carrying 38 commercial satellites from 18 countries. It’s the first Astroscale spacecraft to reach orbit since the startup’s founding in 2013 by Japanese entrepreneur Nobu Okada. Astroscale had launched a micro satellite designed to measure small-scale debris in 2017, but all 18 of the satellites on that particular mission failed to reach orbit, due to human error in the launch vehicle’s programming. This ELSA-d mission is a much more ambitious effort, and involves what amounts to an active on-orbit demonstration of the technology that Astroscale ultimately hopes to commercialize. The mission profile includes repeat docking and release maneuvers between the servicer satellite and the simulated client satellite, which is equipped with a ferromagnetic plate to assist the servicer with its magnetic docking procedure. Why Maxar CTO Walter Scott thinks now is the time to address the orbital traffic boom Astroscale hopes to prove out a range of its advertised capabilities with this demonstration, including the servicer’s ability to search out and locate the client satellite, inspect it for damage and then dock with it as mentioned, in both non-tumbling and tumbling scenarios (i.e. a payload that’s maintaining a stable orbit, and one that’s spinning end-over-end in space with no ability to control its own attitude). There’s a lot riding on this mission, which will be controlled from a ground center established by Astroscale in the U.K. Aside from its long-term commercial ambitions, the startup is also contracted to partner with JAXA on the Japanese space agency’s first orbital debris removal mission, which aims to be the first in the world to remove a large object from orbit, representing the spent upper stage of a launch rocket.

The mission will fly a lander built by space startup Astrobotic , which itself will be carrying NASA’s VIPER, or Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (this is the agency that loves torturing language to come up with fun acronyms, after all). The launch is currently set for later in the year, and this would be Falcon Heavy’s first moon mission if all goes to plan. It will not, however, be SpaceX’s first lunar outing, as the company has booked missions to launch lunar landers as early as 2022 on behalf of both Masten and Intuitive Machines. Those would both employ Falcon 9 rockets, however, at least according to current mission specs. Also, all of the above timelines so far exist only on paper, and in the business of space, delays and schedule shifts are far from unusual. This mission is an important one for all involved, however, so they’re likely to prioritize its execution. For NASA, it’s a key mission in its longer-term goals for Artemis, the program through which it seeks to return humans to the moon, and eventually establish a more permanent scientific presence there both in orbit and on the surface. Part of establishing a surface station will rely on using in-situ resources, of which water would be a hugely important one. Astrobotic last year won the contract to deliver VIPER on behalf of NASA. The mission profile includes landing the payload on the lunar South Pole, which is the intended target landing area for NASA’s Artemis missions involving human astronauts. The lander Astrobotic is sending for this task is its Griffin model, which is a larger craft than its Peregrine lander, giving it the extra space required to carry the VIPER, and making it necessary to use SpaceX’s heavier lift Falcon Heavy launch vehicle. NASA’s ambitious target of landing astronauts back on the moon by 2024 is in flux as the new administration looks at timelines and budgets, but it still seems committed to making use of public-private partnerships to pave the way, whenever it does attain that goal. This first Griffin mission, along with an earlier planned Peregrine landing, are part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, which sought private sector partners to build and deliver lunar landers with NASA as one customer.

https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/zeroavias-hydrogen-fuel-cell-plane-ambitions-clouded-by-technical-challenges/,ZeroAvia’s hydrogen fuel cell plane ambitions clouded by technical challenges,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us When ZeroAvia’s six-seater aircraft completed an eight-minute flight from Cranfield Airfield in the U.K. last September, the company claimed a “major breakthrough” with the first-ever hydrogen fuel cell flight of a commercial-size aircraft. The modified Piper Malibu propeller plane was now the largest hydrogen-powered aircraft in the world, wrote the company. “While some experimental aircraft have flown using hydrogen fuel cells, the size of this aircraft shows that paying passengers could be boarding a truly zero-emission flight very soon,” added Val Miftakhov, ZeroAvia’s CEO. But just how hydrogen-powered was it, and how close is ZeroAvia to flying passengers? “[In] this particular setup, not all the energy is coming from hydrogen,” said Miftakhov at a press conference directly afterwards. “There is a combination of the battery and hydrogen. But the way the battery and hydrogen fuel cells combine is such that we are able to fly purely on hydrogen.” Miftakhov’s comments don’t quite tell the whole story. TechCrunch has learned that batteries provided the majority of the power required for the landmark flight, and will continue to feature heavily in ZeroAvia’s longer flights and new aircraft. And while the Malibu is technically still a passenger aircraft, ZeroAvia has had to replace four of the Malibu’s five passenger seats to accommodate bulky hydrogen tanks and other equipment. In less than four years, ZeroAvia has gone from testing aircraft parts in pickup trucks to gaining the support of the U.K. government, and attracting investment from the likes of Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and — just last week — British Airways. Now the question is whether it can continue on its claimed trajectory and truly transform aviation. ZeroAvia’s hydrogen-powered vision for aviation nets $21.4 million from Amazon, Shell and Bill Gates-backed fund Aviation currently accounts for 2.5% of humanity’s carbon emissions, and could grow to a quarter of the planet’s carbon budget by 2050. Biofuels can displace trees or food crops, while batteries are too heavy for anything more than short hops. Hydrogen, by contrast, can be generated using solar or wind power, and packs quite an energetic punch. Fuel cells combine hydrogen with oxygen from the air in an efficient reaction that produces only electricity, heat and water. But that doesn’t mean you can simply drop a fuel cell into an existing aircraft. Fuel cells are heavy and complex, hydrogen requires bulky storage and there are many technical problems for startups to solve. Russian-born Miftakhov arrived in America in 1997 to study for a physics doctorate. In 2012, after starting several companies and a stint at Google, he founded eMotorWerks (aka EMW) to produce electric conversion kits for the BMW 3-series. But in 2013, BMW accused EMW of infringing its trademarks. Miftakhov agreed to change its logo and marketing materials, and to refrain from suggesting it was affiliated with the carmaker. He also found demand from BMW owners to be sluggish. EMW then pivoted to providing chargers and a smart energy management platform. The new direction succeeded, and in 2017 Italian energy company Enel acquired EMW for a reported $150 million. But Miftakhov faced legal difficulties here, too. George Betak, an EMW vice president, filed two civil lawsuits against Miftakhov alleging, among other things, that Miftakhov had left his name off patents, withheld money and even faked a document to make it seem as though Betak had assigned his intellectual property rights to EMW. Betak later withdrew some claims. The cases were quietly settled in the summer of 2020. Weeks after selling EMW in 2017, Miftakhov incorporated ZeroAvia in San Carlos, California with the stated aim of “zero emissions aviation.” He was counting on the aviation industry being more interested in electrifying existing aircraft than BMW drivers had been. The first public outing for ZeroAvia was in October 2018 at Hollister Airport, 50 miles southwest of San Jose. Miftakhov mounted a propeller, an electric motor and batteries in the bed of a 1969 El Camino and took it up to 75 knots (85mph) on electric power. In December, ZeroAvia bought a Piper PA-46 Matrix, a six-seater propeller plane very similar to the one it would later use in the U.K. Miftakhov’s team installed the motor and about 75kWh of lithium ion batteries — about the same as in an entry-level Tesla Model Y. In February 2019, two days after the FAA granted it an experimental airworthiness certificate, the all-electric Piper took to the air. By mid-April, the Matrix was flying at its top speed and maximum power. It was ready to upgrade to hydrogen. Import records show that ZeroAvia took delivery of a carbon fiber hydrogen tank from Germany in March. One company photo exists of the Matrix with a tank on its left wing, but ZeroAvia never released a video of it flying. Something had gone wrong. Corporate sustainability initiatives may open doors for carbon offset startups In July, ZeroAvia’s R&D director posted a message on a forum for Piper owners: “We have damaged a wing of our Matrix, which we loved and pampered so much. The damage is so bad that it has to be replaced. Is anyone aware of [a suitable aircraft] that is going to be sold for parts any time soon?” Miftakhov confirmed that the damage, not previously reported, occurred while ZeroAvia was reconfiguring the aircraft. That aircraft has not flown since, and ZeroAvia’s time as a Silicon Valley startup was coming to an end. With ZeroAvia’s U.S. flight tests on hold, Miftakhov turned his attention to Britain, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson is banking on ”a new green industrial revolution.” In September 2019, Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI), a U.K. government-supported company, funded a ZeroAvia-led project called HyFlyer, with £2.68 million ($3.3 million). Miftakhov committed to deliver a hydrogen fuel cell Piper that could fly more than 280 miles, within a year. Sharing the money would be Intelligent Energy, a fuel cell maker, and the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC), which would provide hydrogen fueling tech. “ZeroAvia had proved the concept of retrofitting an electric power train into an aircraft and instead of powering it by batteries, they wanted to power it with hydrogen,” said Richard Ainsworth, EMEC’s hydrogen manager at the time. “That was the whole purpose of the HyFlyer project.” Gary Elliott, CEO of ATI, told TechCrunch that it was “really important” to ATI that ZeroAvia was using fuel cells rather than a battery system: “You need to spread your investment profile, so that you’ve got as much likelihood of success as you can.” ZeroAvia set up in Cranfield and in February 2020, bought a six-seater Piper Malibu, similar to the damaged Matrix. Although the company fitted and flew it with batteries by June, the government still needed reassuring. “I’d be happy to catch up and think about what we can do to address the concerns that are nagging away at the ATI,” wrote an official, according to an email obtained by TechCrunch under a freedom of information request. Intelligent Energy CTO Chris Dudfield told TechCrunch that the HyFlyer program went smoothly, but that his company is still years away from flying a larger fuel cell and that he never even saw ZeroAvia’s plane. ZeroAvia’s partnership with Intelligent Energy might have helped it secure U.K. government funding but it wasn’t going to help power the Malibu. ZeroAvia needed to find a fuel cell supplier — fast. In August, ZeroAvia wrote to government officials that “we are now gearing up for our first hydrogen-powered flight,” and invited the Secretary of State to attend. Miftakhov said that ZeroAvia’s demonstration flight used a 250 kilowatt hydrogen fuel cell powertrain — the largest ever in an aircraft. This is comparable in power to the internal combustion engine that Pipers typically use, giving a healthy margin of safety for the most demanding phase of flight: take off. ZeroAvia never identified its fuel cell supplier, nor detailed how much of the 250kW came from the fuel cell. However, the day after the demonstration flight, a Swedish company called PowerCell issued a press release stating that one PowerCell MS-100 fuel cell was “an integral part of the powertrain.” The MS-100 generates a maximum power of just 100kW, leaving 150kW unaccounted for. This means the majority of the power needed for take-off could only have come from the Piper’s batteries. In an interview with TechCrunch, Miftakhov acknowledged that the Piper could not have taken off on fuel cell power alone in the September flight. He said the plane’s batteries were probably operational for the entire demonstration flight, and provided “some additional safety margin for the aircraft.” Many fuel cell vehicles use batteries, either to smooth out fluctuations or to boost power briefly, although some manufacturers have been more transparent about their sources of power. One problem with relying on batteries for take off is that the plane then has to carry them for the whole flight. “The fundamental challenge for hydrogen fuel cell aircraft is weight,” said Paul Eremenko, CEO of Universal Hydrogen, which is collaborating on a 2000kW fuel cell powertrain for another aircraft. “One of the ways we save weight is having a much smaller battery that is only used when a pilot guns the throttle.” In February, ZeroAvia’s vice president, Sergey Kiselev, said that the company’s goal was to do without batteries altogether. “Batteries may be used to provide an extra oomph during take off,” he told the Royal Aeronautical Society. “But if you use different types of propulsion or energy storage on the aircraft, the certification effort will be significantly harder.” Relying heavily on batteries allowed ZeroAvia to pull off its high-profile demonstration flight for investors and the U.K. government, but could ultimately delay its first flights with paying passengers. Without an exhaust to expel waste heat, fuel cells usually need a complex air or liquid cooling system to avoid overheating “This is really the key intellectual property, and why it isn’t just a matter of buying a fuel cell, buying a motor and plugging them together,” says Eremenko. The German Aerospace Center in Cologne has been flying hydrogen fuel cell aircraft since 2012. Its current aircraft, the custom-designed HY4, can carry four passengers up to 450 miles. Its 65kW fuel cell has a liquid cooling system that uses a large, aerodynamically optimized channel for the cooling air flow (see picture). A similar 100kW system would generally need a cooling intake longer and a third bigger than the HY4’s. ZeroAvia’s Piper Malibu has no additional cooling intakes at all. “The openings look way too small for the air speed at take off, and even for cruise speed,” said an aviation fuel cell engineer who asked not to be named because they deal with some of the same companies as ZeroAvia. With a reported deal in the wings for Joby Aviation, electric aircraft soars to $10B business “We had to experiment with the location and configuration of the heat exchangers… but we did not have to redesign the shape of the aircraft to handle the heat,” countered Miftakhov. He claims the fuel cell was operating at between 85 and 100kW during the flight. Following TechCrunch’s interview with ZeroAvia, the company released a video that appears to show the Piper’s fuel cell operating at up to 70kW during a ground test, which could equate to a higher power level when airborne. Although this still needs to be demonstrated with long-distance flights, ZeroAvia may have solved the heat problem that has dogged other engineers for years. In September, aviation minister Robert Courts was at Cranfield to watch the demonstration flight. “It’s one of the most historic moments in aviation for decades, and it is a huge triumph for ZeroAvia,” he said after the flight. Time magazine named ZeroAvia’s technology as one of the best inventions of 2020. Even with the HyFlyer extended flight still to come, in December the U.K. government announced HyFlyer 2 — a £12.3 million ($16.3 million) project for ZeroAvia to deliver a 600kW hydrogen-electric powertrain for a larger aircraft. ZeroAvia agreed to have a 19-seat plane ready for commercialization in 2023. (It now says 2024.) On the same day, ZeroAvia announced its $21.3 million Series A investor lineup, including Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Ventures Fund, Jeff Bezos’ Amazon Climate Pledge Fund, Ecosystem Integrity Fund, Horizon Ventures, Shell Ventures and Summa Equity. It announced another $23.4 million raise from these investors, without Amazon but with British Airways, in late March. Miftakhov said the Malibu has now completed about a dozen test flights, with the long-distance U.K. flight pushed to later this year, due to COVID delays. And as for HyFlyer 2, Miftakhov now says that this will initially use half batteries and half fuel cells, although “the final certifiable flight configuration will get its full 600kW from the fuel cells.” There is no doubt that ZeroAvia is facing a steep climb to deliver its promised aircraft, starting with the 19-seater, then a 50-seater plane in 2026, and a 100-seater by 2030. SEC to investigate short-seller’s claims against Nikola, report says Hydrogen fuel cells still have a whiff of snake oil about them, thanks to Nikola, a startup that exaggerated a public demonstration of a hydrogen fuel cell truck, triggering a collapse in its share price and investigation by the SEC. The best option for ambitious start-ups like ZeroAvia is to be more transparent about their current technology and the challenges that lie ahead, even if that means tempering the expectations of investors and a public excited by the prospect of sustainable air travel. “I desperately want ZeroAvia to be successful,” says Paul Eremenko. “I think we have very complementary business models and together we help complete the value chain to make hydrogen aviation happen.” Topics","Aerospace Technology Institute, Amazon Apps Biotech, Amazon Climate Pledge, Bill Gates, Brand Studio Crunchboard, Breakthrough Ventures Fund, British Airways, But Miftakhov, Chris Dudfield, Computing Commerce Crypto, Contact Us When, Cranfield Airfield, Ecosystem Integrity Fund, El Camino, Entertainment Meta Microsoft, European Marine Energy, Fintech Fundraising Gadgets, Gaming Google Government, Gary Elliott, George Betak, Health Climate Cloud, Hollister Airport, Horizon Ventures, In August, In December, In February, In July, In September, Intelligent Energy, Jeff Bezos, Joby Aviation, Layoffs Media, Newsletters Podcasts Videos, Partner Content, Paul Eremenko, Piper Malibu, Policy Hardware Instagram, Prime Minister Boris, Privacy Robotics Security, Richard Ainsworth, Robert Courts, Royal Aeronautical Society, San Carlos, San Jose, Sergey Kiselev, Shell Ventures, Silicon Valley, Social Space Startups, Startup Battlefield, Summa Equity, Tesla Model, The German Aerospace, Transportation Venture Events, Universal Hydrogen, Val Miftakhov","CEO, CTO, Partner, director, engineer, manager, president",,"Aerospace Technology Institute, Eremenko.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/29/redwood-materials-raises-1b-to-expand-us-battery-supply-chain/,Redwood Materials raises $1B to expand US battery supply chain,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Redwood Materials, the battery recycling startup founded by former Tesla co-founder and CTO JB Straubel, has raised over $1 billion in a Series D round at a post-money valuation of over $5 billion, according to a source familiar with the matter. The raise brings Redwood’s total equity capital to $2 billion. The company says it will use the funds to continue building capacity, expanding domestic battery supply chain, and allowing customers to buy battery materials — like lithium, nickel and cobalt — made in the U.S. for the first time. Most battery materials are sourced or produced in China — a sticking point that has sparked a range of incentives in President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act to onshore the battery supply chain. China processes and refines 59% and 75% of the world’s lithium and cobalt, respectively, compared to 3% and 3.5% for Canada and the U.S. combined, according to data from Benchmark Minerals , a price reporting agency and specialist in lithium-ion batteries for the EV supply chain. To help address this gap and create a closed-loop supply chain in the U.S., Redwood is building out a couple of factories in the U.S. More near-term is Redwood’s 175-acre Sparks, Nevada recycling facility, which will produce anode copper foil. Coming up the pipeline is the company’s 600-acre facility in Charleston, South Carolina that will see Redwood go beyond recycling batteries and refining materials into remanufacturing of both the cathode and anode copper foil. Today, the U.S. usually exports several hundred thousand tons of copper a year to Asia, which is both environmentally unfriendly and leads to critical copper supplies leaving the U.S. Redwood has said it expects to produce around 100 gigawatt-hours annual capacity of cathode active materials and anode foil, which can power 1 million EVs, by 2025. By 2030, the startup hopes to scale production output to 500 GWh per year, which could power 5 million EVs. This latest round of capital will help Redwood get its copper foil production up and running by the end of 2023. Panasonic, which will supply Tesla’s Nevada gigafactory with batteries, will be Redwood’s first foil customer as part of an existing partnership. Redwood began recycling Panasonic’s manufacturing scrap from the Tesla gigafactory in 2019. Redwood’s Series D comes a few months after the U.S. Department of Energy approved a $2 billion conditional loan for the startup as part of the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program. The milestone-based financing will be provided to Redwood in tranches to support its growth and the expansion of its headquarters in Nevada. The round was co-led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Capricorn’s Technology Impact Fund, and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates. New investors, including OMERS, Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund and Deepwater Asset Management, also participated in the round. https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/16/tracking-the-ev-battery-factory-construction-boom-across-north-america/ Topics Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch, where she covers Tesla and Elon Musk’s broader empire, autonomy, AI, electrification, gig work platforms, Big Tech regulatory scrutiny, and more.

A year ago, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act , a law loaded with incentives for climate tech and designed to encourage companies like automakers to bring manufacturing back to the United States. We looked into what the effect of the law has had on the automotive industry, relations with Europe and whether startups — a world we pay attention to — have benefited. The upshot? The battery factory trend might have started before the IRA was signed, but the law has helped accelerate the ramp. And while most funds are headed to infrastructure projects, startups are starting to see more deal flow. Check out our coverage!

ElectraMeccanica , previously the maker of the three-wheeled Solo EV, is merging with electric truck startup Tevva , and the whole deal makes me wonder if there’s a place for such tiny autocycles in the U.S. The Solo could have been a neat way to get around cities, for both commuters and delivery drivers. But ElectraMeccanica struggled to produce its vehicles in a way that was cost-effective. The company faced adoption issues as three-wheelers were excluded from government rebates and it was too difficult to insure the vehicles. Back in March, ElectraMeccanica dropped the three-wheeled pursuit in favor of a more mainstream form of transport. I understand why ElectraMeccanica went with electric trucks. Incentives abound, and going for commercial customers is always a good idea. But it’s sad to see such a green and interesting form of transport fail to make it off the ground. Especially when Arcimoto , probably the only other maker of tiny three-wheeled EVs, is also struggling to stay afloat Perhaps it’s only the three-wheeled aspect that makes such vehicles difficult for America to love. Electric golf carts appear to be on the rise, with some American families (particularly ones in warm climates like Florida) viewing the vehicles as a “second car.” — Rebecca Bellan Talk about a wild ride! Vietnamese EV maker VinFast made its debut on the Nasdaq exchange with a bang. The company, which went public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Black Spade Acquisition, saw shares shoot up 68% to close at $37.06 and a valuation of $86 billion. To put that into perspective, GM, Ford and Stellantis have market caps that are in the $45 billion to $50 billion range. The celebrations didn’t last long. VinFast’s stock has plummeted in the days since. VinFast shares closed Friday at $15.40, which perhaps isn’t suprising considering the young EV upstart delivered just 11,300 vehicles in the first half of 2023 — not to mention its fundamentals show a company with costly ambitions that far outweigh revenue Other deals that got my attention … Assembly Ventures , an early-stage venture capital firm that invests in mobility technologies, closed its inaugural $76 million Assembly Ventures Fund I.

When the California Public Utilities Commissio n voted to approve final permits allowing Cruise and Waymo to expand robotaxi operations and charge for driverless rides, I made a comment that not all newsletter readers appreciated. I wrote: “Cruise and Waymo may have won this battle, but the war to win over the public is hardly over.” The past week has proven my point. Cruise experienced several embarrassing snafus in the few days following the vote, including videos showing vehicles blocking traffic and one driving into wet cement. It was enough to prompt the San Francisco City Attorney’s office to file motions with the CPUC to rollback that approval. And that was before Thursday night, when Cruise collided with a fire truck that was responding to an emergency. A day after that crash, the California Department of Motor Vehicles, the agency that regulates the testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles in the state, asked Cruise to immediately reduce its robotaxi fleet in San Francisco by 50% while it investigates the incident.

https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-ceo-peter-beck-explains-why-the-company-needs-a-bigger-rocket-and-why-its-going-public-to-build-it/,"Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck explains why the company needs a bigger rocket, and why it’s going public to build it",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Rocket Lab packed a ton of news into Monday to kick off this week: It’s going public via a SPAC merger , for one, and it’s also building a new, larger launch vehicle called Neutron to support heavier payloads. I spoke to Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck about why it’s building Neutron now, and why it’s also choosing to go public at the same time. Unsurprisingly, the two things are tightly linked. “We have the benefit of flying Electron [Rocket Lab’s current, smaller launch vehicle] for a lot of customers. and we also have a Space Systems Division that supplies components into a number of spacecraft, including some of the mega constellations,” Beck told me. “So we have very strong relationships with a lot of different customers, and I think we get unique insight on where the industry is going, and where the where the pain points are.” Those pain points informed Neutron, which is a two-stage reusable rocket. Rocket Lab already broke with Beck’s past thinking on what the launch market needed by developing partial reusability for Electron, and it’s going further still with Neutron, which will include a first stage that returns to Earth and lands propulsively on a platform stationed at sea, much like SpaceX’s Falcon 9. But the market has shifted since Rocket Lab built Electron — in part because of what it helped unlock. “The creation of Neutron came from two discrete factors: One, the current need in the marketplace today. Also, if you project it forward a little bit, Neutron will deliver the vast majority — over 90% of — all the satellites that are around or in some form of planning. And if you look at those satellites, 80% of them are megaconstellations by volume. So, in talking with a bunch of different customers, it was really, really apparent that a megaconstellation-building machine is what the market really needs.” Beck says that combining that market need with a historical analysis that showed most large launch vehicles have taken off half-full resulted in them arriving at Neutron’s eight metric ton (just over 17,600 lbs.) total cargo mass capacity. It should put it in the sweet spot where it takes off full nearly every time, but also can still meet the mass requirement needs of just about every satellite customer out there, both now and in the future. Rocket Lab to go public via SPAC at valuation of $4.1 billion “We’re covered in scars and battle wounds from the development of Electron. The one thing that Elon and I agree on very strongly is by far the hardest part of a rocket is actually scaling it — getting to orbit is hard, but actually scaling manufacturing is ridiculously hard. Now, the good news is that we’ve been through all of that, and manufacturing isn’t just as product on the floor; it’s ERP systems, quality systems, finance, supply chain and so on and so forth. So all that infrastructure is is built.” In addition to the factory and manufacturing processes and infrastructure, Beck notes that Electron and Neutron will share size-agnostic elements like computing and avionics, and much of the work done to get Electron certified for launch will also apply to Neutron, realizing further cost and time savings relative to what was required to get Electron up and flying. Beck also said that the process of making Electron has just made Rocket Lab extremely attuned to costs overall, and that will definitely translate to how competitive it can be with Neutron. “Because electron has a $7.5 million sticker price, we’ve just been forced into finding ways to do things hyperefficiently,” he said. “If you’ve got a $7.5 million sticker price, you can’t spend $2 million on flight safety analysis, payload environmental analysis, etc. — you just can’t do that. With a $60 million or $80 million vehicle you can amortize that. So we’ve kind of been forced into doing everything hyperefficiently. And it’s not just systems; it includes fundamental launch vehicle design. So when we apply all of those learnings to Nutron, we really feel like we’re gonna bring a highly competitive product to the marketplace.” Rocket Lab debuts plans for a new, larger, reusable rocket for launching satellite constellations As for the SPAC merger, Beck said that the decision to go public now really boils down to two reasons: The first is to raise the capital required to build Neutron, as well as fund “other” projects. The other is to acquire the kind of “public currency” to pursue the kinds of acquisitions in terms of business that Rocket Lab is hoping to achieve. Why specifically pursue a SPAC merger instead of a traditional IPO? Efficiency and a fixed capital target, essentially. “We were actually sort of methodically stepping toward an IPO at the time and, we were just sort of minding our own business, but it was clear we were pursued very vigorously by a tremendous number of potential SPAC partners,” Beck told me. “Ultimately, on the balance of timelines, this just really accelerated our ability to do the things we want to do. Because, yes, as you pointed out, this kind of streamlined the process but also provided certainty around proceeds.” The SPAC transaction, once complete, will result in Rocket Lab having approximately $750 million in cash to work with. One of the advantages of the SPAC route is that how much you raise via the public listing isn’t reliant on how the stock performs on the day — Beck and company know and can plan on that figure becoming available to them, barring any unexpected and unlikely barriers to the transaction’s closing. “Having all the capital we need, sitting there ready to go, that really sets us up for a strong execution,” he said. “If you look at Rocket Lab’s history, we’ve only raised spend a couple of hundred million dollars to date, within all the things we’ve done. So capitalizing the company with $750 million — I would expect big things at that point.” Early Stage is the premiere ‘how-to’ event for startup entrepreneurs and investors.

https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/relativity-space-unveils-plans-for-a-new-much-larger-and-fully-reusable-rocket/,"Relativity Space unveils plans for a new, much larger and fully reusable rocket",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Relativity Space has just revealed what comes after Terran 1, the small launch vehicle it hopes to begin flying later this year. It’s next rocket will be Terran R, a much larger orbital rocket with around 20x the cargo capacity of Terran 1, that will also be distinguished from its smaller, disposable sibling by being fully reusable — across both first and second stages, unlike SpaceX’s Falcon 9. I spoke to Relativity Space CEO and founder Tim Ellis about Terran R, and how long it’s been in the works for the space startup. Ellis said that in fact, the vision ever since Relativity’s time at Y Combinator has included larger lift rockets — and much more. “When I founded Relativity five years ago, it always was inspired by seeing SpaceX launching and landing rockets, docking with the International Space Station, and this idea that going to Mars was critically important for humanity’s future, and really expanding the possibilities for human experience, on Earth and beyond,” Ellis told me. “But all of the animations faded to black right when people walked out [of spaceship landing on Mars], and I believed that 3D printing had to be this inevitable technology that was going to build humanity’s industrial base on Mars, and that we needed to really inspire dozens, or even hundreds of companies to work on making this future happen.” Relativity Space’s focus on 3D printing and cloud-based software helps it weather the COVID-19 storm The long-term goal for Relativity Space, Ellis said, has always been to become an “end-product 3D-printing company,” with its original Terran 1 light payload rocket simply representing the first of those products it’s bringing to market. “3D printing is our new tech stack for aerospace, and really is rewriting something that we don’t feel has fundamentally changed over the last 60 years,” he said. “It’s really bringing automation that replaces the factory fixed tooling, supply chains, hundreds of thousands of parts, manual labor and slow iteration speed, with something that I believe is needed for the future on Earth, too.” Terran R, which will have a payload capacity of over 20,000 kg (more than 44,000 lbs.) to low-Earth orbit, is simply “the next logical step” for Relativity in that long-term vision of producing a wide range of products, including aerospace equipment for use right here on Earth. Ellis says that a larger launch vehicle makes sense given current strong customer demand for Terran 1, which has a max payload capacity of 1,250 kg (around 2,755 lbs.) to low-Earth orbit, combined with the average size of satellites being launched today. Despite the boon in so-called “small” satellites, many of the constellations being built today have individual satellites that weigh in excess of 500 kg (1,100 lbs.), Ellis points out, which means that Terran R will be able to delivery many more at once for these growing on-orbit spacecraft networks. “It’s really the same rocket architecture, it’s the same propellant, same factory, it’s the same printers, the same avionics and the same team that developed Terran 1,” Ellis said about the forthcoming rocket. That means that it’s actually relatively easy for the company to spin up its new production line, despite Terran R actually being quite functionally different than the current, smaller rocket — particularly when it comes to its full reusability. As mentioned, Terran R will have both a reusable first and second stage. SpaceX’s Falcon 9’s first stage (a liquid fuel rocket booster) is reusable and detaches from the second stage before quickly reorienting itself and reentering Earth’s atmosphere for a propulsive landing just after entering space. The Falcon 9 second stage is expendable, which is the space term for essentially just junk that’s discarded and eventually de-orbits and burns up on reentry. SpaceX had planned to try to make the Falcon 9 second stage reusable, but it would’ve required too much additional mass via heat shielding for it to make sense with the economics it was targeting. Ellis was light on details about Terran R’s specifics, but he did hint that some unique use of fairly unusual materials made possible though 3D printing, along with some sparing use of generative design, will be at work in helping the Relativity rocket’s second stage reusable in a sustainable way. “Because it’s still entirely 3D-printed, we’re actually going to use more exotic materials and design geometries that wouldn’t be possible at all, traditionally, to manufacture,” Ellis said. “It’s just too complicated looking; it would be way too difficult to manufacture traditionally in the ways that Terran R is designed. And that will actually make it a much more reusable rocket, and really helped build the best reusable rocket possible.” Relativity Space raises $500 million as it sets sights on the industrialization of Mars Terran R will also use a new upper-stage engine that Relativity Space is designing, which is also unique compared to the existing engines used on Terran 1. It’s 3D-printed as well, but uses a copper thrust chamber that will allow it to have higher overall power and thrust capabilities, according to Ellis. When I spoke to Ellis on Thursday evening, Relativity had just completed its first full successful duration test of the new engine, a key step toward full production. Ellis said that the company will share more about Terran R over the course of this year, but did note that the existing large 3D printers in its production facilities are already sized correctly to start building the new rocket — “The only change is software,” he said. He also added that some of the test sites Relativity has contracted to use at NASA’s Stennis Space Center are able to support testing of a rocket at Terran R’s scale, too, so it sounds like he’s planning for rapid progress on this new launch vehicle.

These would skim the Earth’s outer atmosphere, reducing travel times for regular international flights from many hours to around 30 minutes. They’ll need to take off from somewhere, however, and rockets are a bit more disturbing to their local environs than traditional aircraft, so part of SpaceX founder Elon Musk’s plan for their regular use is covering oil rig platforms into floating spaceports. Musk has talked about these plans before, and SpaceX recently went so far as to purchase two rigs — which it nicknamed Phoibos and Deimos after the moons of Mars. These are currently in the process of being retrofitted for use with Starship, and they’ll be stationed in the Gulf of Mexico near SpaceX’s Brownsville, Texas development site. SpaceX bought two oil rigs to convert into offshore launch pads for Starship On Wednesday, Musk said on Twitter that one of the two platforms could be at least partially operational by the end of 2021. The SpaceX CEO is known for his optimistic timelines, but a lot of them have actually been relatively accurate lately — or at least not quite as unrealistic as in years past. One of them may be in limited operation by end of year — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 24, 2021 What he means by “in limited operation” isn’t necessarily clear. That could mean that they’re floating where they’re supposed to be, and technically capable of playing host to a Starship prototype, but not that SpaceX will be actively launching Starships from one by end of year. He did add that the plan is to put floating launchpads for Starship not only in the Gulf, but also at various points around the world — which is in keeping with the bold plan he shared via CG concept videos when Starship debuted, which depicted launch and landing facilities stationed in bodies of water near urban destinations.

Now, we know who will join billionaire and Shift4Payments founder Jared Isaacman on that trip – St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital employee, and former patient Hayley Arceneaux. Arceneaux was already selected by Isaacman to be one of the four members of the crew for the mission aboard a SpaceX Dragon, which will include a flight to an unspecified orbit for a trip likely spanning a few days when it launches. The billionaire tipped that he “already knew” who he’d picked to represent St. Jude during a press call when the trip was originally announced earlier this year, but noted that he was saving the reveal. Isaacman is running a months-long campaign around ‘Inspiration4,’ which is what he has named the flight. The remaining two seats will be given to winners chosen from two separate ongoing competitions: One pool includes anyone who makes a donation to St. Jude during the course of a fundraising campaign attached to the launch, and the other will be selected from entrepreneurs who build an online store on Shift4’s newly launched e-commerce platform. Meet commercial astronaut Hayley Arceneaux. She is an amazing person & I know she will be an inspiration to people all over the 🌍. Not just those w/ dreams of going to 🚀, but to all people who need hope when encountering life challenges . Hayley, welcome to @inspiration4x pic.twitter.com/t02LFuU7mm — Jared Isaacman (@rookisaacman) February 22, 2021 As AP reports , Arceneaux is a bone cancer survivor who joined St. Jude last year as a physician assistant. She’s record a number of firsts and records when she gets to space on the upcoming flight, including becoming the youngest American ever in space at just 29, and also becoming the first to enter space with a prosthetic in place – she has an artificial knee and a rod in her thighs bone due to the bone cancer she was treated for at St. Jude when she was 10. Isaacman is footing the entire bill for the SpaceX launch – including covering the tax obligations of the other winners selected for the St. Jude seats on the mission. He has also committed to donating $100 million to the hospital from his own funds, in addition to whatever is raised through the public donation drive that will be used to select one of the other crew members.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/09/the-all-electric-2025-cadillac-escalade-iq-is-loaded-with-tech-and-wrapped-up-in-big-ol-package/,The all-electric 2025 Cadillac Escalade IQ is loaded with tech and wrapped up in big ol’ package,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Like most manufacturers these days, Cadillac is looking to go all-electric in the next few years. By 2030, the company hopes to have its entire fleet run solely on electrons — no PHEVs or mild hybrids here, folks — and to do that, it needs something big to win the hearts and minds of its base. Enter the Escalade, which was revealed Wednesday after months of teasers and speculation of what an EV version of its flagship SUV would look like. This popular full-size SUV is going full BEV for 2025, laden with screens, luxury features, an estimated 450 miles of range and the option to upgrade the automaker’s standard advanced driver assistance system, known as Super Cruise, to the next-level Ultra Cruise, as long as you’re willing to wait a bit. The Escalade isn’t the first Cadillac to get the EV treatment. The compact SUV Lyriq can be had for just under $59,000 while the halo Celestiq sedan goes big starting at $340,000. The 2025 Escalade IQ is nowhere near that six-figure figure price, starting at around $130,000 including destination. Available in Luxury or Sport trims, look for the Escalade IQ at the end of 2024, when it will be sold alongside the traditional Escalade. GM’s Super Cruise driving assist feature has always been a favorite of mine, allowing for hands-free/eyes-up driving across 400,000 miles of pre-mapped roads in the United States and Canada. It’s smooth, confident and takes away the stress of longer road trips and heavy traffic commuting. The Escalade IQ will be shipped with all the cameras, radars and LiDAR needed for Ultra Cruise. The software will then be pushed to owners via an OTA update once GM determines its safe for use. This tech covers 2 million miles of mapped roads and can stop at traffic lights and stop signs. Cadillac says it can follow a route at the speed limit, take turns at corners and even park in your driveway. However, the company did not say when it would push the feature to the Escalade, only that it wouldn’t do so until it feels the technology is ready. The Escalade IQ will be built on GM’s Ultium platform with a 24-module 200 kWh battery– enough storage for a Cadillac-estimated 450 miles of range. The SUV will launch with CSS charging but Cadillac says it is partnering with NCAS so the Caddy should be able to utilize the Tesla charging network as well. The 800-volt architecture means the thing can charge at 350 kW, adding 100 miles of range in 10 minutes or so in optimal conditions. An onboard 19.2 kW charger can add 37 miles for each hour of Level 2 charging at home. Not too shabby. Although I didn’t get a chance to drive the Escalade — in fact Cadillac reps hardly wanted me to touch the static display car — representatives talked me through the features of the large SUV and certainly whetted my appetite to get behind the wheel. Here’s what I imagine might happen. Six friends and I approach the Escalade IQ that has been squeezed into a parallel parking spot on the street. The front and rear lighting signatures do a little welcome dance and the driver’s side door opens automatically. Two pals put their backpacks into the eTrunk up front, not quite taking up the 12 cubic feet of space under the front hood. Meanwhile, I slide into the driver’s seat– it’s sumptuous leather, heated, cooled and massaging, natch– press the brake pedal and the door closes automatically. The 55-inch LED display goes from pillar to pillar, powered by the next generation Snapdragon 12 Cockpit Platform. Google is built in with Maps, Play and Assistant. While I set my navigation my shotgun passenger starts exploring her screen for entertainment, but it’s polarized so I can’t see it from the driver’s seat. My third row passengers easily climb into the rearward seat while my second row passengers are treated to the optional Executive Seating package. They drop the tray tables, turn on their massaging seats and start exploring the 12.6-inch personal seatback screens. There are wireless charging pads back there, plus USB-C and HDMI ports. Those folks are set for the trip. I put the Escalade IQ in gear and the available Arrival mode utilizes the rear steering to move the large SUV with– and I’m not joking here– 35-inch tires diagonally out of the tight parking space and into traffic. We are off to the races. That’s about as far as I want to speculate as to the driving experience of the Escalade until I actually get to pilot the beast. For now I’ll just tell you that Cadillac estimates the front and rear drive motors produce up to 750 horsepower and 785 pound-feet of torque, but you have to be in the Velocity Max drive mode. Normal mode produces a still healthy 680 ponies and 615 pound-feet of torque. The Escalade can scoot to 60 miles per hour in less than five seconds and can tow a maximum of 8,000 pounds. Further, If you have an Ultium Home energy management system you can use the Escalade IQ to power your home if need be. As for the looks of the Escalade IQ — it’s good. And large. But good. At 136.2 inches,  the wheelbase is longer than a traditional ICE Escalade ESV, though its overall length of 224.3 inches can’t quite match the ESV’s expanse. It’s wider than the gas model and the shoulder line of the vehicle matches my shoulder — and I’m a relatively-tall 5-foot, 9-inches. Cadillac wouldn’t say how much it weighs, but the current Escalade can weigh upwards of 6,000 pounds and 200 kWh worth of batteries ain’t light. Meaning this Escalade might follow a similar uber-heavy path that GM’s other hefty EVs, like the GMC Hummer have followed. The 24-inch alloy wheels are pushed way out to each corner, resulting in a long dash-to-axle ratio. However, the rest of the vehicle is just as big so nothing looks out of proportion. The rear roofline slopes down and its streamlined profile give the SUV a 15-percent lower coefficient of drag than in past models. I can dig it. Lighting plays a big part in the Escalade IQ’s design aesthetic. Inside the door panels feature laser-etched wood trim that lights up with your choice of 126 ambient lighting colors. Outside, I love the vertical-oriented headlamps in front flanked by the fun grille lighting but it’s the rear that gets me. The tail lights are split with thin blades surrounding the rear glass and larger pieces down below. The outermost part of those lower tail lamps have a piano-like design feature that catches the eye while the third brake light on the spoiler is designed with a little blip in the middle, kind of like a lighted heartbeat. Taken altogether it gives the Escalade IQ a very distinct nighttime stance and is one of the better-designed rear ends I’ve seen in quite some time.

We’re excited to welcome Straubel, founder and CEO of Redwood Materials — and Tesla’s co-founder, former CTO and newest board member — to the Disrupt Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023 , which runs September 19–21 in San Francisco. Originally described as a battery recycling startup, Straubel’s company has a more ambitious plan. Redwood does recycle battery cell components and sells them back to manufacturers, but it also produces anode and cathode components for lithium-ion batteries — and building a sustainable, closed-loop domestic supply chain to fuel electric vehicles. The company scored a big win earlier this year, landing a conditional commitment for a $2 billion loan from the Department of Energy as part of the Biden administration’s bid to build up a supply chain for EVs in the United States. Responsible for some of Tesla’s most important technology, notably around batteries, Straubel returned to the company last May after shareholders elected him to its board of directors. Don’t miss what’s sure to be an important conversation on the future of sustainable electric vehicles. Prior to founding Redwood Materials, JB Straubel was a co-founder of Tesla, where he spent 15 years as chief technology officer and built one of the best engineering teams in the world. Among many areas, he led cell design, supply chain and the first Gigafactory concept through the production ramp of the Tesla Model 3. Straubel played a direct role in both R&D, team building and operational expansion from prototype cars through to mass production and GWh-scale. He received his MS in engineering and a BS in energy systems engineering from Stanford University. He left Tesla in 2019 to focus on Redwood Materials.

These differ from traditional fuels in that they offer safety advantages during handling, and ecological advantages during production and use. The startup has been working on its solid rocket biofuel since its founding in 2014, and has received grants from the Maine Technology Institute and NASA’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program to refine its fuel formula and rocket engine design to help it get to this point. The company achieved a milestone on Sunday with its first rocket launch — a low-altitude flight of a small sounding rocket, called Stardust 1.0. It’s a single-stage prototype, which can only carry 18 lbs of payload and is designed to achieve suborbital space. That may not seem like much, but it is enough to put small research equipment up into suborbital space, at costs that put launches within range for small companies and academic institutions. Stardust 1.0 is designed to be reusable, though it’s still a prototype, and the company is also working on Stardust 2.0, which is a second prototype that’s expected to increase the payload capacity and act as the primary building block for its subsequent production commercial rockets, including Starless Rogue, a two-stage launcher for suborbital missions, and Red Dwarf, a three-stage, 66-lb capacity launch vehicle that can reach low Earth orbit. Sunday’s launch looked like it might not have been on track to go well at first, with an initial attempt seeing the rocket’s ignition light — but without a takeoff. After resetting for a second try, there wasn’t any ignition. Finally the rocket did take off late in the day, with a flight that the company said “went perfectly” on a follow-up call with media.

Rocket startup Firefly signs satellite constellation launch mission with Satlantis This particular contract was first publicized to its CLPS partners back in September, which would have submitted bids for the project; Firefly clearly carried the day. “We’re excited another CLPS provider has won its first task order award,” said NASA associate administrator for science Thomas Zurbuchen in a release announcing the contract . The last few years have seen many such firsts as NASA has increasingly embraced the commercial sector in providing everything from launch services to satellite and spacecraft manufacturing. It’s not exactly Firefly’s first order from NASA, though: Its national security subsidiary Firefly Black (ominous) will be launching two cubesats for the Venture Class Launch Service Demo-2 mission. But this is larger and more complex by a huge margin (not to mention more expensive). This will be the maiden lunar voyage for Firefly’s Blue Ghost lander, which it’s been working on for the last few years in anticipation of renewed interest in the moon. It will hold the 10 scientific payloads, which NASA describes here , including a new laser reflector array and an experimental radiation-tolerant computer. There’s a lot to be loaded up, but Blue Ghost should have 50kg of space left over for anyone else who wants a ride to the moon. Everything is going to Mare Crisium, a basin on the “light” or near side of the moon, where hopefully they will contribute valuable observations and experiments to inform future visits to and habitation on the moon. Firefly will also be providing the spacecraft that will take the lander into lunar space, and will be responsible for getting it off the Earth in the first place — the company told me they’re evaluating options for that. By the time 2023 rolls around there should be plenty of rides to choose from. Firefly’s own Alpha launch vehicle should have its first flight in March, and the more powerful Beta may be flying by 2023, though neither is ready to commit to a lunar insertion orbit mission today.

The launch was a success in every possible regard, which puts Virgin Orbit on track to become an active launch provider for small payloads for both commercial and defense customers. https://twitter.com/Virgin_Orbit/status/1350960438444511232 Above, you can watch the actual launch itself — the moment the LauncherOne rocket detaches from “Cosmic Girl,” a modified Boeing 747 airliner that takes off normally from a standard aircraft runway, and then climbs to a cruising altitude to release the rocket, which then ignites its own engines and flies the rest of the way to space. Virgin Orbit’s launch model was designed to reduce the barriers to carrying small payloads to orbit versus traditional vertical takeoff vehicles, and this successful test flight proves the model works. Virgin Orbit now joins a small but growing group of private launch companies who have actually reached space and made it to orbit. That should be great news for the small satellite launch market, which still has much more demand than there is supply. Virgin Orbit also offers something very different from current launch providers like SpaceX, which typically serves larger payloads or which must offer rideshare model missions for those with smaller spacecraft. The LauncherOne design potentially means more on-demand, response and quick-turnaround launch services for satellite operators.

Now, SpaceX has purchased two oil rigs to convert for this purpose, as first reported by spaceflight.com’s Michael Baylor , and confirmed by CNBC . The rigs have been named Deimos and Phoibos by SpaceX, which are the names of the two moons of Mars (and the names of the gods of both dread and fear in Greek mythology before that). The rigs were originally designed for offshore deepwater drilling, up to a maximum depth of 8,500 feet. They’re currently located in Brownsville, a port city on the Gulf of Mexico near SpaceX’s Starship development site in Brownsville, Texas. These vessels measure 240 feet by 255 feet and will in theory be repurposed to support launching of Starship (and perhaps return landing, given their reusable design). Thus far, SpaceX has been launching and landing its Starship prototypes on land at its Boca Chica site, though it’s only done lower altitude flights so far. The company also operates two drone ships, which are 300 feet long by around 170 feet wide, as autonomous floating landing pads for its current Falcon 9 rocket boosters. SpaceX also posted another ad seeking a resort development manager to turn its south Texas facility into a “21st century spaceport,” specifically looking for someone with resort expertise. Meanwhile, Musk confirmed that he has moved to Texas last December , following a number of public suggestions that he would do so owing in part to California’s taxation and regulatory environment. Tesla picks Austin for its next US factory to build Cybertruck, Semi truck, Model Y Musk’s other company Tesla also selected Austin as the site of its next gigafactory in the U.S., intended for assembly of its Cybertruck, Model Y and Tesla Semi, as well as Model 3 cars destined for customers on the east coast. SpaceX has maintained engine test facilities in McGreger, Texas, and set up Boca Chica as one of two Starship development sites alongside Florida, before making the south Texas location the sole focus for that spacecraft’s construction and testing after consolidating its efforts.

https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-alphabet-is-shutting-down-loon-internet/,Alphabet shuts down Loon internet balloon company,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Google’s parent firm, Alphabet, is done exploring the idea of using a fleet of balloons to beam high-speed internet in remote parts of the world. The firm said on Thursday evening that it was winding down Loon , a nine-year-old project and a two-and-a-half-year-old spin-off firm , after failing to find a sustainable business model and partners for one of its most prominent moonshot projects. The demise of Loon, which assumed the spotlight after the project helped restore cell services knocked out by a hurricane in Puerto Rico, comes a year after the Android-maker ended Google Station , its other major connectivity effort to bring internet to the next billion users. Google ends its free Wi-Fi program Station Through Station, Google provided internet connectivity at over 400 railway stations in India and sought to replicate the model in other public places in more nations. That said, Alphabet’s move today is still surprising. Just last year, Loon had secured approval from the government of Kenya to launch balloons to provide commercial connectivity services — something it did successfully achieve months later , giving an impression that things were moving in the right direction. Loon, which raised $125 million from a SoftBank unit in 2019 , has long stated its mission as: “Loon is focused on bringing connectivity to unserved and underserved communities around the world. We are in discussions with telecommunications companies and governments worldwide to provide a solution to help extend internet connectivity to these underserved areas.” Perhaps the growing interest of SpaceX and in this space influenced Alphabet’s decision — if not, the two firms are also going to have to confront some difficult feasibility questions in the future. SpaceX snags $885M from FCC to serve rural areas with Starlink “We talk a lot about connecting the next billion users, but the reality is Loon has been chasing the hardest problem of all in connectivity — the last billion users,” wrote Alastair Westgarth, chief executive of Loon, in a blog post. “The communities in areas too difficult or remote to reach, or the areas where delivering service with existing technologies is just too expensive for everyday people. While we’ve found a number of willing partners along the way, we haven’t found a way to get the costs low enough to build a long-term, sustainable business. Developing radical new technology is inherently risky, but that doesn’t make breaking this news any easier.” The blog post characterised Loon’s connectivity effort as a success. “The Loon team is proud to have catalyzed an ecosystem of organizations working on providing connectivity from the stratosphere. The world needs a layered approach to connectivity — terrestrial, stratospheric, and space-based — because each layer is suited to different parts of the problem. In this area, Loon has made a number of important technical contributions,” wrote Westgarth. In a separate blog post, the firm said it had pledged a fund of $10 million to support nonprofits and businesses focused on connectivity, internet, entrepreneurship and education in Kenya. Alphabet also plans to take some of Loon’s technology forward and share what it learned from this moonshot idea with others. Amazon gains FCC approval for Kuiper internet satellite constellation and commits $10 billion to the project Additionally, “some of Loon’s technology — like the high bandwidth (20Gbps+) optical communication links that were first used to beam a connection between balloons bopping in the stratosphere — already lives on in Project Taara . This team is currently working with partners in Sub-Saharan Africa to bring affordable, high-speed internet to unconnected and under-connected communities starting in Kenya,” the firm said. Scores of firms, including Google and Facebook, have visibly scaled down several of their connectivity efforts in recent years after many developing nations such as India that they targeted solved their internet problems on their own. It has also become clear that subsidizing internet access to hundreds of millions of potential users is perhaps not the most sustainable way to acquire customers.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/02/tesla-rival-xpengs-head-of-autonomous-driving-quits-rumored-to-join-nvidia/,"Tesla rival XPeng’s head of autonomous driving quits, rumored to join Nvidia",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us XPeng, a prominent Chinese electric vehicle maker and a competitor to Tesla, has announced the resignation of its vice president of autonomous driving, Xinzhou Wu , over personal and family reasons. Wu, formerly a senior director of engineering at Qualcomm where he spent over a decade, was effectively the head of XPeng’s autonomous driving business and played a pivotal role in helping XPeng gain an edge over its EV rivals in the intelligent driving race. The NYSE-listed EV upstart is recognized for its in-house, full-stack development team responsible for creating the advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) XPeng Navigation Guided Pilot (XNPG), which is considered a counterpart to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. In March, XPeng upgraded its city navigation system for customers in first-tier cities like Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Shanghai. In a few months, the system’s mileage penetration rate had exceeded 60%, XPeng revealed on a recent earnings call . Moreover, the company aims to reduce the number of manual takeovers per 1,000 kilometers when using its highway navigation to one or fewer by the end of 2023. Tesla hasn’t made FSD available in China yet and recently denied rumors that it would introduce the option in Shanghai soon. Even if it had plans to do so, it would take the American giant at least 12 months to localize the system for China’s complex road conditions, Wu said in a previous interview . Wu hasn’t announced his next career move after five years with XPeng, though widespread rumors suggest he’s taking up a senior position in Nvidia’s autonomous driving division. A Weibo post by He Xiaopeng, CEO and founder of XPeng, hints at this possibility, as he expressed pride in Wu soon becoming a top-level manager at a globally renowned company with continued collaborations on chip technology with XPeng. Indeed, XPeng has had a longstanding chip partnership with Nvidia, which itself has made big strides into the autonomous vehicle space with its smart driving platform Drive and state-of-the-art auto chips Wu is passing the torch to Liyun Li, currently senior director of autonomous driving at the firm. According to He, this transition has been in the works for nearly a year and he’s confident that it will play out “smoothly”. The separation appears to be amicable, as evidenced by Wu reciprocating He’s sentiment with a warm message on Weibo. “I believe XPeng’s solid team and system will propel forward the development of ADAS until the era of driverless cars arrives.” The resignation of Wu, which is seen as a huge talent loss for XPeng, came just a week after XPeng announced a promising investment from Volkswagen that will see the pair co-develop electric vehicle models for the Chinese market. While Wu’s resignation may not have an immediate impact on XPeng’s autonomous driving path, it does mark the end of an era at the firm. Wu belongs to a group of AI experts who returned from Silicon Valley to work at emerging Chinese tech companies while managing R&D teams in the U.S. With escalating tensions between the two global powers, numerous Chinese tech giants have downsized their U.S. operations. XPeng turned many heads in the EV industry early this year after appointing Wang Fengying , a veteran with 20 years of experience at Chinese budget pick-up truck and SUV manufacturer Great Wall Motor, as president. To many’s surprise, Wang will be overseeing product planning at the young firm that prides itself on R&D. As Wu remarked in his farewell message, “Five years ago, I crossed the ocean to join XPeng, landing on the right platform at the right time. I found myself stepping into a race that sent the wind and clouds and set the spirits ablaze.” Volkswagen’s XPeng deal sets example for EV alliance between the West and China Topics Reporter, China LIMITED TIME: Save $300+ on your ticket, plus an additional 50% on a second for a full immersive day of AI!

The malfunctioning has frequently been accompanied by driver-facing messages indicating that power steering assist is reduced or disabled, according to the report. The preliminary evaluation into 2023 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles comes after regulators received 12 complaints from owners, according to NHTSA’s investigation. NHTSA has put Tesla under the microscope many times over the years, largely in response to the automaker’s advanced driver assistance systems, Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD). It’s not clear if this investigation relates directly to either ADAS, and NHTSA did not respond in time to TechCrunch’s request for more information. A driver in Woodbridge, Virginia complained that their Tesla Performance Model 3 began showing problems two weeks after delivery on June 15. “Today while driving and making a left turn, the steering wheel locked up while showing an error code UI_a020 stating steering assist is disabled,” the driver wrote in a complaint. “Vehicle steering gets locked, and once you get out and get back in, the car code disappears; however after driving a mile or 2 code reappears, and the steering gets very stiff, making it almost impossible to turn in either direction. Very unsafe and unreliable to drive on highways at high speeds. Please investigate this matter, as I am not the only one with this issue.” Another Model 3 driver reported in May the “car steering felt stuck and slid off the road which resulted in crashing into a tree.” A complaint from a Model Y owner in April said the “wheel jerked hard right and made a thud” and that Tesla had moved their service visit from May 2 to May 25 due to a backlog of parts. The preliminary evaluation is the first step to a formal investigation to determine if the problem poses an unreasonable safety risk. If NHTSA were to demand a recall, it would need to upgrade the probe to an engineering analysis.

Dava Newman, MIT professor of aeronautics and astronautics and former deputy administrator of NASA under Obama, will helm the intellectual hub. The Media Lab is famed for its freewheeling techno-intellectual prowess, but for more than a year has been leaderless following the resignation of former head Joi Ito. Ito resigned when it was discovered that billionaire and alleged child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein had given funding and reportedly received special treatment and access to the Media Lab under his leadership. The ensuing leadership search no doubt looked for, if not exactly new blood (Newman has been involved with MIT for decades) then certainly a break from the past. Out of 60 candidates, they interviewed 13 and ended up picking Newman for a variety of reasons. “In a field of outstanding candidates, Professor Newman stood out for her pioneering research, wide range of multidisciplinary engagements, and exemplary leadership. She is a designer, a thinker, a maker, an engineer, an educator, a mentor, a convener, a communicator, a futurist, a humanist and, importantly, an optimist,” wrote Dean Hashim Sarkis in a letter announcing the appointment. Coincidentally (or is it?), Newman just last week was a speaker at TC Sessions: Space , where she seemed to give a preview of her new responsibilities talking about the importance of inclusion in major efforts like NASA’s Artemis. “It’s going to bring the scientists and engineers together, but we need the artists, we need the designers, they’re the visionaries,” she said. (If you missed the event, you can watch this and all our other panels on Extra Crunch .) Newman seems to be starting off the job by emphasizing one of the best qualities a leader should have: listening to the people she’ll be leading. “I plan to start by doing a lot of listening and learning,” she said in the MIT announcement. “I like to meet people where they are, and to encourage them to put all their great ideas on the table. I think that’s the best way to go forward, working with the whole community — faculty, students and staff — to tap into everyone’s creativity. I can’t wait to get started.” Topics Writer & Photographer Devin Coldewey is a Seattle-based writer and photographer. His personal website is coldewey.cc.

Markets, the parent company of Nanoracks. Nanoracks has provided commercial space services for years now, and most recently provided the Bishop Airlock that was installed on the International Space Station. Bishop is the first dedicated commercial permanent airlock on the ISS, and will provide a major increase in capabilities in terms of providing access to the orbital platform for private small satellites and research. This is Voyager’s third major acquisition this year, after it picked up a majority stake in The Launch Company, a launch support company that provides services and hardware to facilitate launches, and that works with companies including Relativity, Firefly Aerospace and Virgin Orbit. Voyager also picked up Pioneer Astronautics (an R&D company that works on propulsion, fuels, rapid prototyping and much more) in 2020, as well as Altius Space Machines in 2019. Altius is a startup that works on technology for on-orbit satellite servicing. Voyager Space Holdings to acquire multi-launch site startup The Launch Company Nanoracks is probably its highest-profile acquisition, as the company has been involved in more than 1,000 ISS projects, spanning on-station research and small satellite launches from the platform, as well as other orbital and deep space missions. Nanoracks created a commercial space testing platform outside the ISS, and will be demonstrating a technology on a SpaceX mission next year that could eventually be used to convert spent upper stages from launch vehicles into orbital commercial mini space stations. Nanoracks just booked a SpaceX launch to demo tech that turns used spacecraft into orbital habitats Voyager Space Holdings continues its strategic acquisition of new space companies, building out a portfolio that can offer clients significantly more “full-service” solutions than any of these individual companies taken together.

Intuitive Machines has already booked a first lander mission via SpaceX, which is also hosting payloads for other private companies seeking to make lunar landfall under NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program . Intuitive Machines’ Nova-C lander can carry up to 100 kg (around 222 lbs) of cargo to the moon’s surface, and can communicate back to Earth for transmitting the results of its missions. It has both internal and surface-mounting capacity, and will carry science experiments for a variety of customers to the lunar surface through NASA’s commercial partnership program, partly to support future NASA missions including its planned Artemis human moon landings. The first Intuitive Machines lunar lander mission, which will also use a Nova-C lander, is set to take place sometime in the fourth quarter of 2021 based on current timelines.

This is the third large batch of OneWeb satellites to be delivered, after an initial launch of six in 2019, and then a second and third launch of 34 satellites each in February and March of this year. The company then ran into financial difficulties that led to its filing for bankruptcy protection in March, before emerging from said bankruptcy in July thanks to a deal funded in part by the U.K. government, and in part by Bharti Global . In short, it’s been a year for OneWeb. Today’s launch took off from the Vostochny Cosmodrome, and used a Russian Soyuz-2.1b rocket to make the trip. This is the first-ever commercial launch from Vostochny (prior commercial launches handled by Roscosmos have used the Baikonur Cosmodrome), and it meant that OneWeb could launch 36 satellites instead of 34, because of its position relative to OneWeb’s target orbit. OneWeb emerges from bankruptcy, aims to begin launching satellites again on December 17 OneWeb is building a constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites that will provide high-bandwidth connectivity for use in Earth-based networks. The company aims to ultimately have 648 satellites on orbit, and intends to speed up the pace of its launches in order to achieve its target by 2022, which will enable it to offer global network coverage to its customers. Getting ramped and operational is key to OneWeb being able to generate revenue from its offering. The company is also competing with major, well-capitalized LEO networks being created by both SpaceX and Amazon — but we heard from Amazon’s Dave Limp just this past week at TC Sessions: Space that there should be plenty of room for multiple winners in the LEO broadband market, as there’s no shortage of demand for high-quality connectivity at a global scale. While OneWeb’s arrangement with Bharti and the U.K. has helped it emerge from bankruptcy, Bharti founder and chairman Sunil Mittal noted earlier this week that the company will likely need to raise a total of $2.5 billion to finish its constellation — half of which is provided by the U.K./Bharti consortium.

This is a big one for the Jeff Bezos-founded space company, too — it includes upgrades to the crew capsule atop the rocket that are designed to improve the astronaut experience, a key preparatory step as the company approaches its first actual human spaceflight missions. New Shepard has flown 13 times, and carried a number of different payloads to suborbital space before returning to Earth. The reusable launch vehicle aims to ultimately provide rides to space for people, too — and while there’s no stated timeline for this actually happening, tomorrow’s mission is a strong sign that it could be taking place sometime relatively soon. Crew-focused upgrades flying on this New Shepard launch for the first time include acoustic and temperature regulation equipment, display panels that provide information to anyone who would be on board and push-to-talk communications systems installed in each of the crew capsule’s six seats. One of those seats will have a life-sized humanoid flight dummy named Mannequin Skywalker that Blue Origin uses to measure various aspects of the vehicle’s performance. It’ll test astronaut safety alert systems that Blue Origin intends to include on the final flight system, and it’ll also carry a payload with a very different purpose — 50,000 postcards provided to the Blue Origin nonprofit Club for the Future by school kids around the world. Blue Origin successfully launches and lands New Shepard, with a first-ever external booster payload The mission will be broadcast live by Blue Origin via its website and YouTube channel (embedded below) and you can expect the stream to begin around 30 minutes prior to launch time, so at around 10:15 AM EST (7:15 AM PST).

https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/21/grab-acquires-singapores-third-largest-taxi-operator-trans-cab/,Grab acquires Singapore’s third-largest taxi operator Trans-cab,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Singapore’s ride-hailing and food delivery company Grab has signed an agreement for its car rental unit Grab Rentals to acquire Trans-cab , the city-state’s third-largest taxi operator. The deal, Grab’s first local competitor acquisition, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2023 and includes “Trans-cab’s taxi and car rental business, maintenance workshops and fuel pump operations.” Founded in 2003, Trans-cab started with a fleet of 50 taxis and tried to go public twice. It now operates a fleet of more than 2,500 vehicles. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but according to a report by The Straits Times , the acquisition size is estimated at around $75 million . The Nasdaq-listed ride-hailing giant says the acquisition will allow Grab to provide a more extensive base of drivers. Grab wants to address Singapore’s driver shortage issue as ride demand rebounded after the city state lifted the pandemic restrictions. “By boosting the number of drivers on our platform and helping them to operate more efficiently, we improve how quickly and reliably we find a ride for our passengers whenever they need one,” Yee Wee Tang, managing director of Grab Singapore, said in a statement. The purchase comes just a month after the Southeast Asian super app operator laid off more than 1,000 employees, or about 11% of its staff. Singapore’s ride-hailing firm Grab lays off over 1,100 employees Trans-cab drivers will join the Grab platform and receive benefits provided to the current Grab drivers, including free coverage through Grab’s Personal Accident Insurance and access to the GrabAcademy program, which helps the drivers learn skills, including data analytics and digital marketing. Rewards through loyalty programs also will be provided to the drivers. Grab plans to integrate its driver application into Trans-cab’s mobile display units to digitize the business. Grab’s technology will enable Trans-cab taxi drivers to manage their earnings and receive bookings from Grab’s platform and the existing call center of Trans-cab. “Consumer behaviors have shifted and we’ve recognized for some time the need to digitize the business and ensure our taxi drivers can continue to be competitive,” Jasmin Tan, general manager of Trans-cab, said. Consolidation via mergers and acquisitions is on the rise in the tech industry as tight private capital and a slow initial public offering market due to the economic downturn are impacted by growing inflations and high-interest rate headwinds. In April, Singapore’s SMRT announced its ride-hailing operator Strides Taxi would merge with Premier Taxis to bring together a combined fleet of about 2,500 taxis, becoming the country’s second-largest taxi operator. ComfortDelGro has about 60% of the market share in Singapore, with a fleet of about 8,800 taxis.

Your usual host Kirsten Korosec is still away, so you have me for one more week. Let’s jump in. U.S. policymakers and agencies are looking for ways to regulate autonomous vehicles on a larger scale. First, there’s the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which plans to announce a new rule-making in September that could benefit AV companies like Cruise and Zoox , both of which have plans to launch purpose-built robotaxis that don’t have steering wheels or pedals. General Motors, which owns Cruise, submitted a petition in February 2022 to NHTSA to deploy up to 2,500 of the Cruise Origins annually without human controls and may soon have an answer. At a congressional level, lawmakers will host a hearing on July 26 aimed at reviving long-delayed legislation on the safe and regulated adoption of self-driving cars. The panel will consider separate draft legislation from Representative Bob Latta (R-OH) and Representative Debbie Dingell (D-MI). The hearing will be convened by a House subcommittee titled “Self-Driving Vehicle Legislative Framework: Enhancing Safety, Improving Lives and Mobility, and Beating China.” That last bit is important. American industry for decades has used the threat of some other great superpower gaining the upper hand as a narrative to drive forward technological progress, for better or worse. Before we dive in, a quick highlight of my TechCrunch+ story this week that looks into Tesla’s stock price, which has dropped about 10% since the company reported Q2 earnings (more on that below), and why it’s priced as a tech company when its margins scream automaker.

Some more grim news from VanMoof as the e-bike darling that was venture backed to the tune of $189.1 million filed for bankruptcy . VanMoof is considering a third-party sale so that its activities can continue. Those activities being the highly customized parts and the unique digital unlock key that’s connected to VanMoof’s servers. We reported that Cowboy came up with an app to let VanMoof owners retail digital keys to their bikes, but the access is limited. TechCrunch how the company managed to go bankrupt in a booming e-bike market. One industry insider told us that VanMoof spent big on marketing and over-ordering and neglected to think about supply chain and unit costs. As TC’s Ingrid Lunden pointed out: “If the unit economics of the bikes never worked out, and an app can be built in a day to unlock those bikes that are in the market already, why would anyone want to assume the assets of the failed startup?” Bird is officially back in compliance with the NYSE. London-based bike-share HumanForest has launched a new feature, Forest Parcel, to provide a zero-emission, on-demand parcel-delivery service. Taur , the front-facing scooter manufacturer, has launched its second model, the Taur II, on Kickstarter . The scooter has up to 40 miles of range. Taur also started a campaign to challenge the U.K. government on their stance on owned scooters, which are still illegal to ride on public roads. There are, however, shared scooter pilots, which often serve to sway government and public opinion away from scooters as a viable transportation option due to the behavior of renters and potential for street clutter. The company said it would reimburse the fines of any Taur customer who is fined by the police for riding on U.K. roads. And if the scooter is confiscated, Taur will replace it free of charge. Commsignia launched a V2X device for e-bikes and other micromobility vehicles that broadcasts messages about the cyclist’s position and direction from other road users. It also receives messages from other vehicles and alerts the rider to potential hazards. Autonomous vehicle company Aurora Innovation has sold $820 million worth of stock . About $220 million came from a public offering that priced the stock at $3 per share, and the remaining $600 million came from a concurrent private offering of stock priced at $2.70. Aurora, a pre-revenue company building frontier technology, has been spending a pretty penny in its pursuit of commercializing self-driving trucks by the end of 2024. In 2022, the company lost about $1.7 billion. Aurora hasn’t been shy about its need to raise more funds in order to make it to commercialization and beyond. The company said it has about $785 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of June 30, 2023. This infusion of capital gives Aurora another $1.6 billion to play around with. The company is hoping the funds will take it “well into 2025.” Alpha Grid , a San Francisco–based EV charging deployment optimization startup, raised a $2.5 million pre-seed led by Asymmetric Capital Partners. Twine Ventures also participated. Lithium-ion battery recycling company Aqua Metals has entered into a strategic partnership with Yulho , a battery materials company based in South Korea. The partnership includes a $5 million equity investment from Yulho into Aqua. Berlin-based Cycle has secured $11.3 million in Series A funding to expand its e-bike subscription model for the last-mile delivery industry. The funds will be used to expand geographically throughout Europe, including the U.K.; bring on new customers in parcel and mail logistics; and grow its fleet size. EVgo and its eXtend partners received $13.8 million in funding from Ohio’s DOT to deploy 20 fast-charging stations. Farizon , Geely’s electric and hybrid truck unit, has raised $600 million to expand outside of China. Fortescue Future Industries , a global green energy and metals company, will acquire EV truck maker Nikola ’s Phoenix Hydrogen Hub project for $24 million. Singapore’s ride-hailing and food delivery company Grab , via its car rental unit Grab Rentals, will acquire Trans-Cab , the city-state’s third-largest taxi operator. The terms weren’t disclosed, but the acquisition size is estimated at around $75 million. New York–based supply chain and visibility startup Leverage raised $7 million in a round led by Chicago Ventures. Auto supplier Magna is investing a whopping $790 million to build three new supplier facilities in West Tennessee, including the first two onsite at Ford’s BlueOval City. Indonesia EV maker Maka Motors raised $37.6 million in seed funding to mass produce its two-wheeled EVs. Maka will start deploying its first pilot EVs this month and is aiming for volume production in late 2024. Redwood Materials , the battery recycling startup founded by Tesla co-founder J.B. Straubel, is reportedly in talks to raise $700 million at a $5 billion valuation. The company would not confirm the reports. Hong Kong–based delivery robot startup Rice Robotics raised $7 million in additional seed funding from Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund, Soul Capital, Audacy Ventures and others. FreightFriend , a platform for capacity and freight management tools, was acquired by Truckstop. Correction: We incorrectly stated that Truckstop was acquired by FreightFund. We have corrected the error to reflect that FreightFund was acquired by Truckstop. Mobileye has introduced a vision-only speed assist solution for automakers. The camera-based Intelligent Speed Assist is launching in production vehicles this year and lets cars sense speed limits without needing to rely on third-party map and GPS data. ’s full-page ad in several newspapers calling humans terrible drivers got the attention of the former NHTSA head. “Using the pain and suffering of those deaths for self-promotion of an unproven and unsafe product is unscrupulous,” said Joan Claybrook. Speaking of Cruise, the company has officially started initial robotaxi testing in Miami Another Cruise-related issue. The California Public Utilities Commission — the agency that has the power to give Cruise and Waymo final sign-off on their plans to expand commercial robotaxi services across San Francisco 24/7 — had planned to question the two companies over how they will deal with robotaxis malfunctioning and blocking access from first responders. Update: The July 31 meeting has been cancelled. Kodiak Robotics is working with Drivewyze to launch a weigh station program for self-driving trucks on Texas interstates. The goal is to address how trucks will handle weigh station inspections without a driver present to facilitate the process. Online used car retailer Carvana reported higher-than-expected earnings of $2.96 billion in Q2, with adjusted EBITDA totaling $155 million. The company sold 76,530 cars during the quarter, which was slightly fewer than expected by analysts. Carvana also announced it will reduce its outstanding debt by over $1.2 billion by exchanging existing unsecured debt with new notes. The company might also sell up to $350 million in new stock as part of the restructure. The combined news of healthy earnings and debt exchange deal caused Carvana’s stock to spike Wednesday as high as $60.90. The company’s stock has come back down to earth somewhat, settling at around $47 Thursday at market close. Tesla hit $25 billion in revenue in the second quarter, which just beat Wall Street estimates. Despite the record revenue, Tesla’s stock started to slide in after-hours and the next day by as much as 10%. That was likely a response to Tesla’s continued hit to automotive gross margins after a series of price cuts. Margins slid to around 18%, which is down from the 25% Tesla was rocking a year ago. Tesla also reported that solar installations are slipping , but energy storage installations saw a boost in the second quarter. Ford slashed the price of its F-150 Lightning , in some trims by as much as $10,000. The automaker cited manufacturing efficiencies as the cause of the lower price. Ford is also being questioned by House Republicans over its battery cell technology deal with China’s CATL in its upcoming $3.5 billion battery cell plant in Michigan. General Motors is experiencing downtime at its CAMI plant in Canada (which builds the BrightDrop commercial EVs) in order to manage parts-availability issues. Regular operations will resume July 31, and it won’t affect GM’s overall EV production targets in North America — 50,000 in the first half and 100,000 in the second. Remember the Kia Boys ? The people who had been following a viral trend on TikTok to steal Kias using a USB cord? A 14-year-old Texas boy has been linked to nearly 40 thefts. The has opened up its third special investigation into a crash this year. This is related to a fatal crash involving a 2018 Model 3 and connected to the vehicle’s Autopilot system. Nissan has joined the ranks of automakers that have adopted Tesla’s NACS charging standard for its Ariya and future EV models. Rivian can move ahead with its EV facility production plans in Georgia after the state’s Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to the validity of about $700 million in tax breaks the EV startup expects to receive. Stellantis signed $11.2 billion worth of contracts through 2030 to secure semiconductors needed for its EVs and high-performance computing functions. India’s Tata Motors plans to build a 40 GWh battery cell gigafactory in the United Kingdom. The over $5.16 billion investment will deliver batteries for JLR and Tata Motors, with supplies beginning in 2026. Vietnam’s VinFast will hold a groundbreaking ceremony at its electric vehicle factory in North Carolina on July 28. The company expects to invest $4 billion in the factory, which is designed to reach a capacity of 150,000 vehicles per year. Volkswagen ’s Knoxville Innovation Hub has published research breakthroughs to increase EV range and recycle vehicle materials, the company said. These include a wireless EV charging concept. It was another big week of Tesla news, especially with the automaker kicking off earnings season. Let’s dive in. During Tesla’s Q2 earnings call, Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla was in talks with a major OEM to license its FSD software and hardware out to them. FSD (“full self-driving”) is Tesla’s advanced driver assistance system that is NOT fully autonomous, despite the tech’s confusing name. Musk also said that for Q3 only, Tesla owners looking to upgrade to newer models could transfer their FSD over. Earlier in the week, Tesla announced that drivers with home solar and a Powerwall charger now have an in-app option to exclusively charge up their vehicle via excess solar energy The automaker also showed off its first Cybertruck built at Giga Texas over the weekend, to much fanfare but few specifics. We’re still wondering about production capacity and price, which were not addressed during the earnings call. Outside the U.S., Tesla is hoping to expand its German factory, but residents want assurances on water use, biodiversity protection and environmental impact. Also, Tesla directors, including Musk, will have to pay $735 million back to the company to settle claims from shareholders that they excessively overpaid themselves. As part of the deal, the directors also agreed not to receive compensation for 2021, 2022 and 2023. ByteDance ’s Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok) is doing food delivery now? So food delivery giant Meituan decided to add more video to its app in kind. Policymakers have introduced a bill that would increase fuel taxes for private jet travel from the current $0.22 to $1.95 per gallon, and remove existing fuel tax exemptions for logging and oil or gas exploration. The idea is that if the rich want to pollute our skies, they can pay extra. The revenue generated by the so-called FATCAT Act would be transferred to a fund that would support air monitoring for environmental justice communities. Spotify is bringing a new experience to Teslas that will make displaying content bolder and more accessible. Drivers can take advantage of features like QR codes for easy log-in, access to audiobooks, and one-touch jump to artists and album pages. Uber Freight laid off almost 50 brokerage employees. EVTOL startup Archer has brought on Nikhil Goel, co-founder of Uber Elevate, as the company’s chief commercial officer. This comes on the heels of adding former FAA administrator Billy Nolen. InDrive has launched its bid-based ride-hail app in Miami, its first U.S. market. The company’s business model is based on customers naming their own fare and nearby drivers accepting, declining or countering the offer. Revel , the Brooklyn-based startup doing shared e-mopeds, EV charging hubs and an all-electric, all-employee ride-hail service, announced that it has hired over 1,000 New Yorkers as Q2 employee drivers. California Supreme Court rejected an argument Uber that hoped to limit the ability of its drivers to take employment-related disputes to court. The court unanimously determined that the defendant, driver Erik Adolph, couldn’t sign away his right to represent his peers in a class-action lawsuit, even though his contract requires him to take any employment-related disputes to arbitration. This ruling could have ripple effects in the gig economy space. Beep beep!

It hasn’t shared details about the cause yet, but they did confirm that they won’t be attempting the launch today and will advise as to the next attempt window. SpaceX is already having a banner year, with major accomplishments including its first human spaceflight, and it’s aiming to pad its current record-breaking launch year with a 25th flight today. The launch will carry SiriusXM-7, a broadcasting satellite for satellite radio service SiriusXM, delivering it to a geostationary transfer orbit from Space Launch Complex-40 in Florida. This is actually the second launch that SpaceX has conducted just this week, after flying its 21st commercial resupply mission to the International Space Station for NASA on December 6 . SpaceX has a nearly two hour window for today’s launch, beginning at 11:21 AM EST (8:21 AM PST), and weather is currently looking good. UPDATE: SpaceX updated the launch time to 12:55 PM EST. The booster used on this launch flew during Demo-1, the first crewed flight for SpaceX ever, which brought astronauts to the ISS in May, as well as during a RADARSAT launch, and four separate Starlink launches during 2020. This will be its seventh flight, tying a record for SpaceX’s flight-proven first-stage boosters. It’ll attempt to land aboard the company’s drone landing ship in the Atlantic Ocean after deploying its second stage and cargo.

https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/zeroavias-hydrogen-powered-vision-for-aviation-nets-21-4-million-from-amazon-shell-and-bill-gates-backed-fund/,"ZeroAvia’s hydrogen-powered vision for aviation nets $21.4 million from Amazon, Shell and Bill Gates-backed fund",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us ZeroAvia , the company that’s on a mission to move the world to zero-emission, hydrogen-fueled flight, has just received some corporate jet fuel in the form of a new $21.4 million cash infusion. The investment came from the Bill Gates-backed Breakthrough Energy Ventures and the Ecosystem Integrity Fund , which led the company’s latest round, alongside previous investors Amazon Climate Pledge Fund, Horizons Ventures Shell Ventures and Summa Equity . Aviation is a huge contributor to the carbon emissions that cause global warming, and the industry, along with shipping, will be one of the hardest to decarbonize. Electrification technologies have yet to account for ways to propel aircraft or move massive seafaring vessels, and a consensus is emerging among technologists that hydrogen will be the best solution to ensure zero-emissions flight can become a reality. “ I’m a big believer in hydrogen from the perspective that if I have enough zero carbon hydrogen, and it’s cheap enough, then I can do anything ,” said Eric Toone, the executive managing director and science lead at Breakthrough Energy Ventures. Industry backers think that ZeroAvia may also be the ticket to solving many of the aviation industry’s problems. The company has established a partnership with British Airways and received a $16.3 million grant from the U.K. government to ensure that its 19-seat hydrogen-electric airplane is ready for the market by 2023. Longtime investor Shell Ventures doubled down on its commitment to ZeroAvia with this round, on the back of the company’s unique approach to integrating various proven technologies to bring hybrid hydrogen-electric flight to market. “Each individual component is not unique in a sense. The powertrain is not unique, the fuel system isn’t unique… [But] bringing it all together in a system, is not just technically getting a plane in the sky but having those conversations with regulators about what do we need to change and all the steps involved in getting to a commercial play,” said Paul Bogers, the vice president of Hydrogen at Shell. ZeroAvia is now developing and testing the certification-ready ZA-600 powertrain, which can fly a 10 to 20-seat aircraft up to 500 miles, the company said. And earlier this year the company completed the first commercial-scale battery electric flight and the first flight of a hydrogen fuel cell-powered aircraft. The company said it would expect to complete a long-distance flight of 250 miles within the next three months. For Val Miftakhov, the founder and chief executive of ZeroAvia and a serial entrepreneur whose last company, eMotorWerks, was sold to Enel, the flights prove out his thesis that hydrogen power is the answer for the aviation industry. “Our most recent milestone achievements are closing the gap for the airline industry to begin its transition away from fossil fuels. In fact, over ten forward-looking airlines are now gearing up to implement our powertrains when they are ready in 2023,” Miftakhov said in a statement. “Both aviation and the financial markets are waking up to the idea that hydrogen is the only meaningful path towards large-scale, zero-emission commercial flight. Powering a 100-seat plane on hydrogen is not out of the question. We feel deeply grateful to our top-tier investors for joining us in the next phase of our exciting journey; to bring in a new golden age of aviation.” The key to the company’s success is the realization that using existing electrolyzer technologies, natural gas can be converted into hydrogen, which can be used to power the aircraft’s systems, Miftakhov said. “We manage fuel supply,” Miftakhov said. “We’ve done that already at the airport in Cranfield. We make our own fuel from electricity and water. We are not building new technology in the hydrogen manufacturing space. We’re utilizing partners on the electrolysis side.” The company is working with Enapter to provide the electrolyzer for now, and expects to deploy larger systems at other airfields in the U.K. and U.S. as part of its ongoing demonstrations. “The scale of consumption allows you to economically make fuel on site. That’s the game changer for hydrogen,” Miftakhov said. “You don’t have to transport it… You can’t liquefy it… You don’t have to worry about transporting it because it’s a low-density fuel… It’s a mess… If you make it on site all of those challenges go away… We think infrastructure is going to be fine.” It was Miftakhov’s experience building eMotorWerks that led him to explore hydrogen as the solution for the aviation industry. “Batteries aren’t energy dense enough for the amount of energy you need for the aircraft,” he said. “Aviation is the most energy intensive form of transit… and you can’t stop in the middle.” Initially, the company will go to market with retrofits for the 10 to 20-seat aircraft in use on short-haul flights across Asia and the Caribbean, Miftakhov said. However, the company has relationships with seven of the biggest aircraft manufacturers in the world which are working on ways to integrate the company’s powertrains into their aircraft, Miftakhov said, and the company is on track to integrate into large passenger planes like an A320 or a 737 by the end of the decade. Transitioning to a hydrogen fleet is going to take more than the technical ability of a new breed of manufacturers though, Miftakhov said. It will also require government intervention. “By 2050 everybody wants to be zero emission and net zero. [But] we are already too late. 2050 is one vehicle lifetime away. The governments are going to come in and say we’re going to force the acceleration of the vehicle generation turnover,” he said. Miftakhov wants to be ready when that regulation happens. The company has signed letters of intent with operators to retrofit more than 100 aircraft already. And it has laid the groundwork for working on new types of aircrafts. For corporate investors like Amazon that have committed to decarbonize by 2040, the innovations and industry adoption can’t happen quickly enough. “Amazon created The Climate Pledge Fund to support the development of technologies and services that will enable Amazon and other companies to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement ten years early — achieving net zero carbon by 2040,” said Kara Hurst, VP Worldwide Sustainability, Amazon. “ZeroAvia’s zero-emission aviation powertrain has real potential to help decarbonize the aviation sector, and we hope this investment will further accelerate the pace of innovation to enable zero-emission air transport at scale.” Topics Writer Jonathan was an editor at TechCrunch./p> LIMITED TIME: Save $300+ on your ticket, plus an additional 50% on a second for a full immersive day of AI!

https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/capella-space-now-offers-the-highest-resolution-sar-imagery-commercially-available/,Capella Space now offers the highest resolution SAR imagery commercially available,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us SF-based small satellite startup Capella Space is now exclusively offering the most cutting-edge synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery available on the commercial market. The company has now made available 50cm x 50cm “Spot” imagery — much higher resolution than the previous 1m x 25cm images that were the best available. SAR imagery offers advantages versus other types of satellite-based observation, because it can operate regardless of cloud cover, air visibility, lighting (whether it’s day or night) and more. Capella Space has designed, built and operated its SAR satellites entirely in-house, making it the first U.S. company to do so. Founded and led by former JPL engineer Payam Banazadeh, the company has so far launched one of its satellites to orbit on a Rocket Lab launch that lifted off at the end of August. The company has plans to launch two more of its spacecraft on board a future SpaceX rideshare launch, potentially before year’s end. Currently, Capella’s commercially available max resolution isn’t actually even technologically bound — it’s limited by a maximum set by U.S. regulators about how detailed SAR imagery can be when made available to private sector buyers. Cappella notes that it can sell even better imagery to U.S. government customers, and that it should be able to offer even 25cm x 25cm resolution imagery commercially once “regulations catch up to technologies.” SAR imagery is poised to become a major disruptive shift for space-based Earth imaging, especially as the technology to achieve this level of detail becomes more generally accessible and affordable, enabling startups like Capella to provide it to commercial businesses. It’s also a rich platform upon which to layer analytics and other types of observation data for detailed insights that simply weren’t possible with the limitations of optical imaging alone. Obviously, the tech is also very much of interest to national security organizations, and Capella already has contracts in place to show that, aided by its all-American pedigree. Banazadeh is joining us at our TC Sessions: Space event, which kicks off later today, so we’ll likely hear more about this new high-resolution imagery and its applications then.

Tesla drivers with home solar and a Powerwall charger now have an in-app option to exclusively charge up their vehicle via excess solar energy . The automaker started rolling out the setting in May , under a rather idyllic name: Drive on Sunshine. The setting is now more straightforwardly dubbed “ Charge on Solar ; it’s available to folks in the U.S. and Canada with newer Teslas (2021 and on). The option looks like this: The rise of electric vehicles and the ubiquity of solar panels have prompted countless dreamers to suspect that the two technologies will converge. The solar-powered car as we know it dates back to the 1950s with GM’s Sunmobile, a modded Corvette that reportedly captured enough solar energy to roll across a stage at a Chicago auto show. Cars with solar roofs have come a long way since then (see: efforts by Lightyear , Fisker Karma Toyota and even Tesla ), but such solar-roofed vehicles still aren’t hitting roads in serious numbers. In the meantime, Tesla has long facilitated solar-powered charging via home solar panels and chargers, and the automaker’s Charge on Solar feature seems to offer select drivers another degree of control over how they recharge.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/14/nyc-gig-workers-need-help-accessing-safe-e-bikes-amid-lithium-battery-fires/,NYC gig workers need help accessing safe e-bikes amid lithium battery fires,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The sight of bike delivery workers hustling through the streets of New York — oven mitts duct-taped to their handlebars, insulated pizza delivery bags strapped above the back tire — has been a staple long before the introduction of e-bikes and food delivery apps. Delivery workers are so integral to the landscape that it’s often easy to take them for granted. But New York wouldn’t be the city that never sleeps if its denizens couldn’t get an order of chicken wings and pork fried rice delivered at three in the morning. As cost of living skyrockets and demand for food delivery via apps like Grubhub, DoorDash, Uber Eats and Relay increase, delivery workers have to pick up and drop off orders at a much faster clip. This increased pressure comes as electric bikes, scooters and mopeds become more popular and accessible, making the jobs of delivery workers easier. The downside? Fires caused by lithium-ion batteries are tearing through the city. And deliveristas, the gig labor force largely made up of immigrant men from Spanish-speaking countries, are increasingly at risk of falling victim to such fires. As if they didn’t have enough to worry about, given bike theft, assaults, reckless NYC drivers, rain, snow, hail, sleet, heat and no access to public toilets. In New York City, lithium-ion fires caused by micromobility vehicles have more than doubled each year from 2020 to 2022, according to Fire Department of New York (FDNY) data. In 2022, there were 220 fires that resulted in 147 injuries and six deaths, up from 104 fires, 79 injuries and four deaths in 2021 and 44 fires, 23 injuries and zero deaths in 2020. This year, there have already been 114 investigations into lithium-ion fires, 74 injuries and 13 deaths, as of July 3, 2023. While the FDNY doesn’t break down stats into what types of devices caused the fires, 80 of the 2023 fires occurred in structures like homes, buildings and offices. Of course, not all of these fires can be tied to the on-demand delivery industry. A recent deadly blaze that killed four people in Chinatown started from an e-bike store. But deliveristas seem to be at a higher risk than the average e-bike owner. Gig work is low-income work, which means deliveristas are more likely to buy cheap e-bikes and batteries that aren’t certified. They also spend hours a day riding bikes all over the city, which means more wear and tear and the possibility of damaging the batteries. And when it comes to range management, many deliveristas don’t have safe, secure places to charge, and may end up charging them in their apartments, perhaps even overnight, which can lead to overheating. In recent months, Mayor Eric Adams has announced an action plan to combat lithium-ion battery fires, which includes funding battery storage and charging hubs, pushing for incentives and rebates to buy better bikes and raising awareness on the issue. The city has also passed two crucial laws; the first, which recently went into effect, prohibits the assembly or reconditioning of lithium-ion batteries using cells removed from used storage batteries. The second, which goes into effect in September, involves banning the sale, lease or rental of micromobility devices and batteries that fail to meet recognized safety standards. As gig workers scramble to get their hands on certified vehicles, they say the app companies should be responsible for helping them out. William Medina, a member of Los Deliveristas Unidos, a collective of New York City’s delivery workers, told TechCrunch he thinks “these multimillion-dollar delivery companies…should implement some support to workers to make sure they’re buying safe batteries.” “They don’t assume any responsibility when there are fires, accidents or deaths,” said Medina, noting that deliveristas were the ones bringing food and medicine to people throughout the pandemic, and that they keep NYC moving as a 24-hour economy. The average cost of a certified e-bike that’s used by delivery workers is around $1,500, according to workers TechCrunch spoke to. On top of that, the cost of maintenance, charging, insurance and battery replacements could set a worker back another $450 to $550 annually. Medina says a typical six-day work week in NYC might bring in $700 to $800, and that’s before expenses and taxes. Gig workers are classified as independent contractors, not employees. As a result, app companies are careful with how much support they provide to their workers and in what ways, lest they creep into employer territory. Veena Dubal, a professor of law at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco, says foisting the costs of doing business onto “the workers who create the most value for the firms,” is one way to avoid employer responsibility. “The companies are worried that if they provide charging stations or safe batteries, this will not only increase their labor costs, but it will also be indicative of their status as employers — providing the instrumentalities of work,” Dubal told TechCrunch via email. “This is yet another example in which the dangers of this work are unjustly borne by low-income, racial minority workers, who may lose life or limb to earn a sub-minimum wage.” DoorDash, Uber and Grubhub have all separately donated $100,000 to the FDNY Foundation to support its efforts to increase fire safety messaging, education and outreach. Both DoorDash and Uber are also supporting the Equitable Commute Project (ECP), which offers an e-bike trade-in program. They each donated $200,000 to the ECP, according to Melinda Hanson, co-founder of the organization. As part of the trade-in program, delivery workers can trade their uncertified e-bike, e-scooter or e-moped for a discounted UL2849-certified Tern Quick Haul with two Bosch batteries. While the Tern is an amazing bike that’s well-suited for delivery, the prospect might not appeal to workers who would still need to shell out for the cost of the bike — $2,200 plus tax. While that’s about 40% off the retail price of that bike, it’s still not exactly within the range of a deliverista’s budget. The problem is that quality e-bikes, even discounted ones, have to compete with the sub-$1000 bikes that deliveristas can buy from China or on sites like Alibaba, which much better suit a delivery worker’s pre-tax income of no more than $800 a week, according to workers who spoke to TechCrunch. As one Reddit user put it: “Realistically, is a delivery worker going to turn in their uncertified e-bike and pay $2,200+ tax for a certified one in the name of safety?” That said, ECP works with Spring Bank to give workers access to a low-cost, 12-month loan , even if the worker has no credit score, so that workers can buy their bike from ECP through low monthly payments. DoorDash told TechCrunch it also works to raise awareness, regularly sending out battery fire safety tips. The company’s landing page for bike Dashers also includes links to resources like battery charging and storage tips and where to find rebates and incentives. DoorDash also partners with e-bike companies Dirwin and Zoomo to help Dashers get access to safe bikes. Dirwin offers 30% off the purchase of an e-bike, helmet and front basket, as well as a free accessory package that includes a cell phone mount, water bottle holder, tire pump and sunglasses. That’s available for financing at around $33 per week or a total price of around $1,600 for everything. Zoomo’s partnership with DoorDash gives Dashers in NYC $100 off its “Boost” plan, which costs $199 per month for an e-bike subscription. Included in that subscription is access to any of Zoomo’s e-bikes, servicing, theft protection and a spare battery. Uber is also working with Zoomo on an identical partnership offering. The companies will also work together on a trade-in program that will give couriers with uncertified e-bikes “a significant monetary amount” toward a new e-bike when they trade it in. Uber told TechCrunch it plans to invest close to $1 million collectively in its pilots with Zoomo and ECP and its FDNY donations. Zoomo said thousands of couriers have signed up through its partnerships with UberEats and DoorDash. Grubhub is currently doing a six-month pilot with Joco , a docked, shared e-bike operator that services gig workers, to give at least 500 gig delivery workers per month free access to Joco’s bikes. Joco’s fleet of 1,000 bikes can be found at 55 stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. Grubhub also sponsored a Joco rest stop in downtown Manhattan where workers can take breaks, use the bathroom, charge their phones and switch out dead batteries with fully charged ones. Since the pilot launched in mid-June, the companies say they’ve had about 1,000 unique visitors to the hub, but neither would stipulate exactly how many riders have taken advantage of this offer for free e-bike access. Grubhub also didn’t say whether it has plans to extend the pilot beyond six months. The company also told TechCrunch in April it was actively working to establish a battery recycling program to take in non-certified e-bikes but did not provide any updates on that initiative. Relay, a local NYC gig delivery company, would not answer TechCrunch’s questions about how it is helping delivery workers. The main causes of e-bike, e-scooter and e-moped battery fires are: Cheap vehicles and batteries made with low-quality manufacturing processes and budget materials; overcharging in crowded conditions among other devices charging; damage to the battery; and overuse. All of these are common among delivery workers, and the issue is compounded because it’s New York City, where everyone lives in cramped apartments so a blaze in one unit spreads quickly to the next. Aside from measures that the city is taking to ensure the safety of its labor force, advocates and workers say gig companies could be doing more to support solutions. After all, delivery workers are the backbone of their entire enterprises, and if they aren’t going to get fair working conditions, they could, at the very least, be aided in not causing — or dying in — a lithium-induced blaze. For a start, the delivery companies could create a standard for e-bikes that their delivery workers use, similar to how Uber and Lyft have a standard for the cars allowed to be used for ride-hailing. Uber and Lyft also pay into the Black Car Fund in NYC, which helps drivers get access to benefits like Workers’ Compensation. The delivery companies, the city and restaurants could create a similar fund that goes toward giving workers access to affordable and safe batteries. Some workers told TechCrunch it would make sense for companies and the government to fund a battery buy-back program because replacing batteries might be cheaper than subsidizing entire e-bikes. In fact, a bill has been introduced to the NYC Council that would set up a program to provide new batteries for e-scooters and e-bikes at reduced or no cost, or in exchange for used batteries. Uber, Grubhub and DoorDash could also help fund better charging and storage infrastructure — places where workers can lock up their bikes and charge them safely. Other options include piloting battery swapping services like those offered by Taiwan-based Gogoro and Berlin-based Swobbee . A study done by WXY Studio , and ironically commissioned by Uber, found that better pay could also help address the battery fire issue because workers would be able to afford better-quality bikes. The irony is that Uber, as well as DoorDash and Grubhub, is suing the city for mandating a guaranteed minimum wage of $18 per hour for delivery workers, a wage that many labor advocates argue isn’t even a living wage after expenses Gig companies can also offer incentives for delivery workers who purchase UL-certified e-bikes and other micromobility devices. Uber currently claims to offer drivers $1 per trip in an electric vehicle, so the precedent has already been set. Apps could also potentially provide loans to delivery workers or subsidize leases and rent-to-own programs. Finally, they can raise awareness. Companies should be leading the charge with informing deliveristas of the risks, how to stay safe, where they can find good deals on certified bikes and what laws or resources are in place.

But the company is now deploying a new navigation system that has the potential to be much better, and it’s using true reinforcement-learning AI to teach itself to optimize navigation better than humans ever could. Loon developed the new reinforcement-learning system, which it says is the first to be used in an actual product aerospace context, with its Alphabet colleagues at Google AI in Montreal over the past couple of years. Unlike its past algorithmic navigation software, this one is devised entirely by machine — a machine that’s able to calculate the optimal navigation path for the balloons much more quickly than the human-made system could, and with much more efficiency, meaning the balloons use much less power to travel the same or greater distances than before. How does Loon know it’s better? They actually pitted the new AI navigation against their human algorithm-based prior system directly, with a 39-day test that flew over the Pacific Ocean. The reinforcement learning model kept the Loon balloon aloft over target areas for longer continuous periods, using less energy than the older system, and it even came up with some new navigational moves that the team has never seen or conceived of before. After this and other tests proved such dramatic successes, Loon actually then went ahead and deployed it across its entire production fleet, which is currently deployed across parts of Africa to serve commercial customers in Kenya . This is one of few real-world examples of an AI system that employs reinforcement learning to actively teach itself to perform better being used in a real-life setting, to control the performance of real hardware operating in a production capacity and serving paying customers. It’s a remarkable achievement, and definitely one that will be watched closely by others in aerospace and beyond.

The company, founded by Jane Poynter and Taber MacCallum, who previously founded stratospheric balloon company World View, is focused on developing Spaceship Neptune, a pressurized passenger capsule that is meant to be carried by an ultra-high altitude balloon to the very edge of space to provide passengers with an unparalleled view. Spaceship Neptune is designed to carry up to eight passengers on a six-hour journey that will include two hours spent at the upper edge of Earth’s atmosphere and a water landing in the Atlantic Ocean. The first test flight is currently targeted for the end of the first quarter of 2021, according to Space Perspective, and it will involve flying an uncrewed Neptune capsule prototype, which also won’t have the pressurized cabin of the final version. Startup Space Perspective plans space tourist ‘cruises’ using stratospheric balloons, with test flight set for 2021 From there, the plan is to test and develop systems necessary for Neptune to take up its first human passengers, with the goal of doing that by sometime around 2024, with ticket pre-sales launching from 2021 for interested, deep-pocketed parties. Poynter and MacCallum’s prior venture World View originally included human stratospheric space tourism trips as part of its business model, but the company has since pivoted to focus on scientific and commercial communication and observation payloads exclusively under its current leadership.

https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/rocket-lab-makes-its-first-booster-recovery-after-successful-launch/,Rocket Lab makes its first booster recovery after successful launch,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us New Zealand-born launch provider Rocket Lab took a step toward making its launch vehicles reusable today with the safe splashdown and recovery of an Electron booster after it successfully took its payload to orbit. The image above is the view from the booster up into the parachute that brought it safely down. Reusing the first stage of launch vehicles — that is to say, the booster that takes the payload from the ground to the edge of space, where a second stage takes over — has the potential to vastly reduce the cost of getting to orbit. For decades these precision-engineered machines, which cost millions to produce, have been abandoned after use and allowed to break up on reentry. SpaceX first demonstrated recovery of its Falcon 9 rockets in 2015, landing one on a drone ship after several failed attempts with other launches. A used first stage was first re-launched in 2017 . Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck announced last year that the company would be attempting its own method of recovering a used booster. Instead of the complex propulsive controlled landing of the Falcon 9, the booster would descend safely under a parachute, and be intercepted and captured by a helicopter before splashdown. Today’s mission, however, skipped the helicopter step as perhaps being a bit ambitious for a first try. After delivering some 30 satellites and a 3D-printed gnome to the edge of the atmosphere, the Electron’s booster returned to Earth and was tracked to where it splashed down about two hours later. Rocket Lab’s next launch will deliver 30 satellites to orbit — and a 3D-printed gnome from Gabe Newell According to a press release from Rocket Lab sent after the launch, the descent and recovery went exactly as planned: Approximately two and a half minutes after lift-off, at an altitude of around 80 km, Electron’s first and second stages separated per standard mission procedure. Once the engines shut down on Electron’s first stage, a reaction control system re-oriented the stage 180-degrees to place it on an ideal angle for re-entry, enabling it to survive the incredible heat and pressure known as “The Wall” during its descent back to Earth. A drogue parachute was deployed to increase drag and to stabilize the first stage as it descended, before a large main parachute was deployed in the final kilometres of descent. The stage splashed down as planned. Rocket Lab’s recovery team will transport the stage back to Rocket Lab’s production complex, where engineers will inspect the stage to gather data that will inform future recovery missions. “What the team achieved today in recovering Electron’s first stage is no mean feat. It took a monumental effort from many teams across Rocket Lab, and it’s exciting to see that work pay off in a major step towards making Electron a reusable rocket,” said Beck. The recovery crew is securing Electron's first stage and preparing to bring it back via ship to our production complex.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/30/electrify-america-nacs/,Why automakers are rushing to adopt Tesla’s NACS plug and what it means to drivers,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us How did the North American electric vehicle market finally decide on a charging port? Gradually, then suddenly, to paraphrase Ernest Hemingway. The war isn’t over yet, but with Electrify America announcing this week that it would add Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS) plugs, it’s close. Electrify America’s decision is particularly important because it’s both the largest non-Tesla, fast-charging network and because it’s owned by Volkswagen, a notable holdout. The shift in momentum was particularly swift. In late 2021, when the government mandated that EV chargers be equipped with CCS to receive federal money, it seemed like Tesla’s NACS was living on borrowed time. The automaker already sells EVs in Europe with an EU-mandated connector that’s similar to North America’s CCS, so it wasn’t such a leap to imagine a similar thing happening in the U.S. But then Tesla cut a slew of deals with competitors. The first of them breathed new life into NACS, and then subsequent deals tipped it toward becoming the de facto standard. Over the last month or so, Ford , GM Rivian Volvo and Polestar have all said they’d switch to NACS. That leaves Volkswagen, Hyundai, Stellantis, Lucid, Toyota and Nissan. (There are others, but those are the bigger players in the EV space.) Of that group, several are likely to announce a switch to NACS soon. Volkswagen, Hyundai and Stellantis have all said they’re in talks with Tesla. Lucid is a bit of a wild card since there’s some bad blood between its CEO, Peter Rawlinson, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Toyota’s EV strategy is so far behind that the choice of fast-charging ports is barely an issue. And Nissan, well, who knows about Nissan — the company still sells cars with CHAdeMO ports long after everyone else gave up on them. Also this week, SAE International, an automotive standards body, said it would expedite work to develop an industry standard around NACS, a move that should assuage other companies that were wary of letting a competitor control a key part of the EV experience. For EV owners and observers, the tidal wave of support for NACS raises a number of questions. What will happen to EVs that don’t have NACS? What’s driving the change? Is this a good move for consumers? Who wins? And perhaps more importantly, who loses? Hundreds of thousands of EVs equipped with CCS are on the road today — and potentially millions more before automakers make the switch. For those owners, these can feel like uncertain times. The world of technology is filled with tales of losing standards: direct current Betamax HD-DVD WiMax . Usually, owners of a product that lost a standards war are left with a worthless piece of equipment. Fortunately, both CCS and NACS use the same protocols for charging and communication. Several charging equipment manufacturers have already pledged to support NACS connectors, and many charging networks have said they would install the plugs on future and current equipment. For charging stalls that only have one plug type or another, drivers will need a relatively simple adapter. Anyone who has experienced a port change — USB-A to USB-C or Apple’s 30-pin adapter to Lightning, for example — knows that dongles aren’t ideal. Using a port adapter with a vehicle is a mixed bag, too. Unlike computers, most cars last for a decade or more, prolonging the need for a dongle. But unlike computers, most people today charge at home, meaning they’ll probably only need the dongle when they’re taking a road trip. Ultimately, there will be an awkward transition period that will cover a few more model years, maybe more. It’s likely that a few million vehicles with CCS will be on the road before the NACS changeover is complete. That’s not a ton, but probably enough to keep charging networks maintaining their CCS plugs for a while longer. Plus, the federal National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program currently mandates CCS in order for charging networks to receive federal dollars. Tesla is no doubt lobbying hard for that to change, but for now, it’s the law. ( Washington and Texas have already mandated the inclusion of NACS connectors for new charging stalls.) Tesla has been trying to get other manufacturers to adopt its plug design for years, but until about a month ago, only one took it up on the offer: Aptera, a small company without any products for sale. A few things changed recently, though. In November, Tesla announced that it was “opening the North American Charging Standard.” Since the communication protocol was the same as what CCS uses, the only thing other automakers would have to change is the plug design. Not trivial, but not onerous, either. (What wasn’t clear in Tesla’s November announcement is whether the company’s design patent , which is expected to expire in 2027, would be freely available to any automaker and unencumbered with any terms.) The move probably opened the door to other automakers considering the design, but apart from Aptera, they moved cautiously, undoubtedly concerned about trusting a competitor’s design for a key component. Yet automakers also knew that existing charging networks outside of Tesla’s Supercharger were comparatively sparse and unreliable. That was another part of the EV experience that automakers largely didn’t control. The question was, which one had the potential to hinder EV sales the most? Ultimately, they decided that gaining access to a solid charging network was more important than controlling the plug design. Ford, for example, might produce a great EV, but it wouldn’t sell if people didn’t have confidence that they could take it on road trips. Once Ford and GM announced that they would adopt NACS, momentum behind NACS grew. Other automakers, possibly already in talks with Tesla, rushed to wrap their deals so they, too, could gain access to the Supercharger network. The obvious winners in this deal are non-Tesla drivers who will gain access to the Supercharger network in the coming years. Non-Supercharger networks generally suck , and most EV owners today know that. The deals automakers have inked with Tesla so far don’t appear to provide access to the entire Supercharger network, but customers will have access to enough of it to make a difference. Competing charging networks fall into both the winner and loser buckets. Their decision to add NACS plugs to their stalls could gain them new Tesla-driving customers. But they’re also going to face some stiff competition. Given the choice of a Supercharger and a competitor, most drivers will probably head to the Supercharger. (There’s still a chance Tesla could drop the ball and implement a terrible experience for non-Tesla owners, but history suggests it’ll get it right.) Probably the only group that falls more on the loser side of the ledger is current Tesla owners. Part of what makes the Supercharger network so appealing today is the fact that, for the most part, people don’t have to wait long to plug in. With all the new EVs that will have access to the network, Tesla is going to have to double its size to maintain today’s level of service. For Tesla, these deals are something of a mixed bag. The company has spent over a decade building a worldwide network that only served to sell more cars. Now it gets to cash in, using its first-mover advantage to potentially pad the bottom line. Potentially. We don’t know if Superchargers are profitable today — the company hasn’t had to break out those figures in its quarterly reports, instead including them in “services and other revenue.” But as Supercharger revenue grows, shareholders might pressure the company to disclose them in more detail. It’s possible that the Supercharger network will be like AWS has been to Amazon, a secret weapon that propels growth . But it’s also possible that it could become an albatross weighing on its earnings. Charging networks are massive infrastructure projects that require constant upkeep. In other words, they aren’t easy businesses to run profitably. This article was updated to clarify details about Polestar’s adoption of NACS.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/28/joby-aviation-receives-permit-to-fly-first-evtol-built-on-production-line/,Joby Aviation receives permit to fly first eVTOL built on production line,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Joby Aviation has reached a series of milestones that put it on track to deliver its first electric aircraft to a customer by 2024 and commercialize an air taxi service by 2025. Joby’s Marina, California pilot production plant, which operates in partnership with Toyota, has rolled out its first eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle) — made possible by a helpful $180 million injection from investor Baillie Gifford in May. The aircraft is Joby’s first production prototype, and it means Joby is one step away from having a commercially viable eVTOL for passenger use. The production prototype eVTOL — Joby’s third full-scale prototype — also received a special airworthiness certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and can now begin flight testing. “This first aircraft coming off our pilot manufacturing line is a really, really big deal for the company,” JoeBen Bevirt, founder and CEO of Joby, told TechCrunch. “We have spent many years building the processes and procedures and capabilities as an organization to be able to deliver this level of of aircraft. We’ve been building since 2017, but to be able to build with this level of rigor is a huge step forward. It prepares us for this next stage of the certification process.” Joby has already flown more than 30,000 miles since 2019 on pre-production prototype aircraft. This latest iteration builds on that experience and puts the company closer to achieving type certification with the FAA. Type certification means that the FAA approves of Joby’s aircraft design and component parts, and that the design is compliant with the agency’s standards for airworthiness and noise. Joby nearly has three out of the five necessary stages of the type certification process underway, according to Bevirt. The final step after type certification would be production certification, which will allow Joby to mass produce eVTOLs under FAA-approved designs. The eVTOL company already received its Part 135 air carrier certificate , which allows Joby to begin on-demand commercial air taxi operations, in May 2022. Joby’s production prototype aircraft has the potential to be the first eVTOL delivered to a customer, says the company. It will be deployed at Edwards Air Force Base in 2024, per Joby’s Agility Prime contract with the U.S. Air Force, which is worth up to $131 million. To meet that deadline, Joby will have to work quickly with the Air Force in order to secure military airworthiness certification. The design of that aircraft will be replicated at Joby’s pilot manufacturing facility. “We have multiple of these aircraft coming down the production line, and that will be what we’ll be using both for customer applications and also for the type certification process,” said Bevirt. Joby plans to commercialize an aerial rideshare service by 2025. Joby’s pilot manufacturing line was built in partnership with Toyota. The Japanese automaker is Joby’s largest external investor and will supply powertrains and actuation components to the company. “Not only has Toyota invested almost $400 million in the company, they’ve also put a significant number of engineers on site with us working shoulder to shoulder here in California, as well as having a team of engineers back in Japan working on processes,” said Bevirt. “So when people come through our pilot manufacturing line, they can see the incredible technologies and systems that Toyota has brought to bear and help Joby learn about how to do manufacturing.” The pilot manufacturing line gives Joby the capability to make tens of aircraft per year, said Bevirt. The next stage is building a “phase one manufacturing facility” that will allow Joby to build larger quantities of eVTOL. Bevirt didn’t say where that manufacturing facility would be or when Joby hopes to break ground, but he did say the partnership with Toyota would be essential for that project, too. In a move that deepens the relationship between the two companies, Joby also announced Wednesday that Tetsuo “Ted” Ogawa, president and CEO of Toyota Motor North America, will join Joby’s board of directors on July 1. Ogawa has 39 years of experience at Toyota and currently leads Toyota North America as president and CEO, which runs 14 production plants in North America. “As we look at scaling our manufacturing, we couldn’t be more thrilled to have somebody of his stature joining the Joby board,” said Bevirt. “We think this really demonstrates Toyota’s commitment to leading in this next stage of mobility.” Aside from a manufacturer-investor relationship, Joby has worked with Toyota and Japanese airline ANA to explore ways to launch an air taxi service in Japan that connects to ground-based transportation. Bevirt wouldn’t say where Joby intends to commercialize air taxi operations first, but he did say that the company has been working closely with the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau, which Bevirt describes as “extremely forward leaning.” “We’ll be continuing to engage with them on our path to bringing the service to Japan,” he said.

https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/relativity-space-is-raising-a-massive-500m-round-at-2-3b-valuation/,Relativity Space is raising a massive $500M round at $2.3B valuation,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Rocket printer Relativity Space is raising a $500 million D round, valuing the launch provider at $2.3 billion, as reported by CNBC and confirmed to TechCrunch by sources familiar with the matter. That’s not bad for a company that has yet to take its first payload to orbit. Relativity aims to reduce the cost and increase the speed of assembling a launch vehicle by 3D printing it from tip to tail fin. The process has many advantages that have been borne out in testing — and the company aims to launch its first mission in 2021. Relativity Space’s Tim Ellis is coming to TC Sessions: Space 2020 The company’s last big raise was $140 million in late 2019 , which helped it build out a new Long Beach headquarters and finalize its Terran-1 rocket. The switch from a series of machines and assembly lines with fixed tooling to a handful of enormous custom 3D printers both simplifies the building process and enables new capabilities. For instance, Relativity recently snagged its first big government contract , a NASA-Lockheed mission with special considerations for the cyogenic systems in the payload. These can be revised and tested right up to a couple months before launch, unlike an ordinary building process which might require the hardware to be locked in a year or more before. The $500 million round would presumably be to scale operations in earnest, gathering the personnel, materials, transportation, insurance and other necessaries for taking on major missions. Terran-1 hasn’t flown yet, but the projected costs and cadences make it a very attractive option, larger than Rocket Lab’s Electron but smaller than a SpaceX Falcon 9 — and pound for pound, maybe more cost-effective than both. Much depends on the next year as Relativity takes Terran-1 from the factory to the launchpad. The first orbital test flight is planned for late 2021. CNBC’s Michael Sheetz reported that Tiger Global Management will lead the round, with Fidelity also joining and existing investors adding their support.

https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/why-florida-residents-may-soon-be-seeing-jet-powered-flying-taxis/,Why Florida residents may soon be seeing jet-powered ‘flying taxis’,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Florida is renowned for its strange news stories. In recent weeks alone, one resident reported an alligator in her garage that turned out to be a pool floatie ; another discovered a python in her washing machine ; and a horse needed to be pulled out of a septic tank by firefighters. Still, don’t dismiss Orlando residents who report seeing flying taxis overhead, because they may just be coming. Lilium Aviation , a five-year-old, Munich, Germany-based, venture-backed startup that designs and makes electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, is reportedly seeking tax incentives from the city to build a 56,000-square-foot transportation hub with the promise that it will create 100 high-wage jobs in return. Lilium unveils five-seater air taxi prototype after a successful maiden flight for its latest jet According to the Orlando Business Journal, the proposed facility — a takeoff and landing area that would be part of Lilium’s first transportation network in the U.S. — would represent a $25 million investment and, according to the city’s own estimates, generate $1.7 million in economic impact in a 10-year period. (Lilium in September began separately exploring with Germany’s Düsseldorf Airport and Cologne Bonn Airport how to turn the two airports into regional air mobility hubs.) It’s seemingly a smart time for Lilium — whose planes aren’t expected to be up and running until 2025 — to be talking with cities about additional airport revenue. Passenger traffic has fallen through the floor, owing to the pandemic, and cargo traffic has not been immune , either. Meanwhile, 95% of revenue from airports comes from aeronautical and non-aeronautical services. Lilium also has a little more spending money after raising $35 million in fresh funding in June led by Baillie Gifford, the largest investor in Tesla — a round that brought the company’s total funding to date to $375 million. Lilium adds $35M from Baillie Gifford at a $1B+ valuation for its electric aircraft taxi service Earlier investors in the company include Atomico, Tencent Holdings and Freigeist. We sat down with Atomico founder Niklas Zennström in late 2016 when the firm had just led a €10 million Series A in Lilium. At the time, the bet seemed early, despite the existence of rivals like Terrafugia and AeroMobile , yet such vehicles may be an everyday reality sooner than imagined. Investors and founders seem to think so, at least. There are now at least 15 so-called flying cars and taxis in development.

This is a bit of a surprise, because the launch company said that it would be doing this on its 17th flight, and the next launch is actually its 16th, but the company had a succinct answer for why it moved up the timetable. I know we said flight 17 for recovery but… pic.twitter.com/N3HDdCwPFD — Rocket Lab (@RocketLab) November 5, 2020 This isn’t the first test Rocket Lab has performed in pursuit of reusability — after announcing in August 2019 its intent to recover and refly the Electron booster, something Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck originally said wasn’t in the cards for the company, Rocket Lab has tested reentry guidance and control systems , as well as the parachute to be used to slow the booster’s descent once it’s back in Earth’s atmosphere. Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket will go reusable, with the company aiming for mid-air helicopter recovery In a video released today, Beck explained the reasoning behind even attempting to recover the boosters (essentially to increase the company’s rate of production by eliminating the need to build a new booster for every flight) and also the reasons why it wasn’t in the original plan (the Electron is too small to allow for an engine-powered boost back like the ones Falcon 9 and Blue Origin’s New Shepard uses). But Beck and team realized they could use an unconventional approach that involves flipping the rocket around and angling it such that it survives reentry, paired with a drogue parachute deployment and primary parachute combo that slows it enough that a helicopter can catch it midair as it drifts. This recovery attempt won’t include that midflight snag, but will instead hopefully see the booster land itself gently enough on the ocean’s surface, slowed by the chute, allowing a recovery team to pick it up. Beck says that the helicopter catch part is actually not his biggest concern, since the company has previously demonstrated that part of its approach works in practice. Instead, it’s ensuring that they’re just able to actually get the stage after it deploys its orbital cargo to begin with. If Rocket Lab can recover this first stage, that will put it well-within striking distance of putting an operational recovery system in place, hopefully leading to less time between launches and potentially lower operational costs down the line. No matter how the launch works out, we’ll get the chance to go over the attempt and next steps with Beck at our inaugural TC Sessions: Space event in December, where he’s joining us on our virtual stage for a fireside chat .

While no money will change hands, NASA will dedicate millions in personnel and other support to these test launches and developing technologies. The partnerships are NASA’s Announcement of Collaboration Opportunity selections for 2020. These agreements are unlike the SBIR or NIAC programs in that NASA doesn’t just send some money out and say “let us know how you’re getting on in six months or so.” Instead, the space agency offers open access to its facilities and experts, some of which are the most advanced in the world. It’s a true public-private partnership, for which reason it is still a competitive process to get a project approved — and the list of 17 companies includes several large ones. SpaceX will be working with Langley to monitor and perform thermal measurements of its Starship launch vehicle and spacecraft during reentry operations over the Pacific. Rocket Lab, similarly, will partner with Langley, Ames and Armstrong to do analysis of its Electron launch vehicle as it migrates the hardware toward reusability. The company recently moved up the date it would attempt a full booster recovery to just a week from now, but it’s unclear whether this is an operation in which NASA will be involved. Rocket Lab will try to recover the booster of its Electron rocket for the first time on its next launch Blue Origin, meanwhile, has two separate partnerships. One is another multi-center effort in which the company will be helping develop a “space robot operating system.” This sounds grand, but is probably more of an integration effort, bringing together multiple open source and NASA-developed frameworks to work together, reducing costs and improving interoperability. The other is regarding using 3D printing to improve engine designs; perhaps they regret letting Tim Ellis run away and start Relativity Space — he cut his teeth doing just this kind of work at Blue Origin and now it appears the company is going to have to play catch-up.

The final stage in the certification process was the Demo-2 mission that SpaceX launched earlier this year, carrying NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station on May 30, 2020, and now all necessary review of the results of that successful mission is complete. NASA announced the milestone via its official blog, noting that this certification included a Flight Readiness Review in preparation for the first-ever official ISS crew mission of the Falcon 9 and Dragon, which is set for this Saturday, November 14 — weather permitting. That will carry four astronauts, including three from NASA and one from Japan’s space agency, to the ISS for an official full-length stay conducting experiments and maintaining the orbital station. NASA and SpaceX set November 14 target date for first operational Crew Dragon launch This is the final step in the multi-mission certification process, which included a number of previous launches, including an uncrewed ISS docking mission, which ran fully automated, and a launch pad abort test to demonstrate how the launch vehicle’s safety system would work in the unlikely event of an accident following launch but prior to reaching orbit. SpaceX also developed and extensively tested a new parachute system for controlling the descent of the Dragon crew capsule upon it’s return from the station to Earth. NASA says that it and SpaceX performed an “extensive analysis of the test flight data” following the Demo-2 mission, which concluded in August with a successful return to Earth carrying Behnken and Hurley back from the station.

Zoox says this marks the first time that an autonomous vehicle built without pedals or a steering wheel has operated on public roads in Nevada. Zoox is starting small with a one-mile loop around the neighborhood where its Las Vegas facilities are located in the southwest region of the city, with plans to expand in the coming months. The initial route will test Zoox’s robotaxi on several unprotected turns and multi-way stops, as well as its ability to navigate roads with cyclists, pedestrians and other cars, according to a blog post . The robotaxis, which can transport four people at a time at speeds of up to 35 miles per hour, will be available to Zoox employees during workday hours. Zoox did not specify how many vehicles it will have on the roads or during what hours of operation it will provide this initial robotaxi service. But a company spokesperson did say there will be “multiple” Zoox vehicles testing. The company said it has been driving on public roads in Vegas since June 16, 2023, and has been in the city for much longer. The company expanded operations to Las Vegas to test, validate and refine its technology in 2019 with an eye toward launching commercial operations there in the future. The company used a test fleet of Toyota Highlanders to map the area and gather data, while driving autonomously with safety drivers on board. In 2020, Zoox opened an office and depot in Vegas to support its test fleet. The company is now expanding those operations and adding 190,000 square feet of warehouse and office space for its vehicles and its growing team in the region. The company’s workforce, which is spread between several locations in California, Nevada and Washington, has grown from 1,900 employees to 2,200 since the beginning of the year, the company confirmed. The bulk of new hires in Las Vegas are for its “mission readiness” team, which is focused on fleet maintenance and charging. The Vegas launch follows Zoox’s deployment on public roads in Foster City , California, in February. Zoox, which holds a driverless testing permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles, is also transporting employees there. The company has yet to open up its vehicles to the public. Nevada is a much easier state in which to test AVs than California, which has a rigorous permitting process overseen by the California DMV. Nevada allows all automation levels to operate on public streets and its DMV doesn’t test or certify vehicles. Zoox said in a tweet that it had been given authorization from Nevada’s DMV to operate its robotaxi autonomously. According to Nevada law , AV companies that want to develop and test vehicles in the state need to self-certify that vehicles meet the Nevada “minimal risk condition” to be able to stop if there is a malfunction in the system.

https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/how-is-the-air-force-looking-to-spend-its-60-billion-rd-budget/,How is the Air Force looking to spend its $60 billion R&D budget?,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Dr. Will Roper, the man in charge of the purse strings for the Air Force’s $60 billion research and development and acquisition budget, oversees some 550 programs for the Air Force. It’s a huge responsibility that has massive implications for the future of the American military, and as the priorities for the military’s air and space command shift, Roper says that acquisitions will require an emphasis on working “at a pace that today’s technology, trends and threats require.” The keys to the future of Air Force acquisitions will be agility and flexibility, Roper told an audience last month at the Air Force Association 2020 Virtual Air, Space and Cyber Conference , according to an Air Force report. “If you look at the world in which we live today, we must be agile,” Roper told the audience. “There are too many possible futures for us to pick one and build a force that’s geared to defeat it.” That sentiment should give developers of new technologies $60 billion worth of reasons to pay attention when Roper joins us at TechCrunch’s Sessions: Space event this December 16-17 . Roper has placed an emphasis on what he calls digital engineering to create internal manufacturing capabilities within the Department of Defense and develop new defensive capabilities and offensive weaponry for a 21st century battlefield. As the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics — and principal adviser to the secretary and chief of staff of the Air Force for R&D, test, production and modernization efforts within the Air Force — Roper has a view into where the military is racing ahead to meet the challenges of the battlefield of the next millennium. In Roper’s view that could encompass the presence of weaponized artificial intelligence, persistent drones or even genetically edited bioweapons or human augmentation, he told his virtual audience in that September presentation. For Roper, the first order of business is to find a way to get the military innovating faster than consumer technologies — a task made that much more complicated by the lack of bureaucratic constraints private companies enjoy compared to their military counterparts. “The last area that we have to have strategic agility is in being able to computerize or virtualize everything about our development and production, assembly, even sustainment of systems, so that we can finally get past the tyranny of the real world and take learning and feedback into the digital one,” Roper said in his September address. The Air Force is already turning to digital-first design with its eSeries of hardware, which has already notched a huge win with the design, assemblage and testing of its Next Generation Air Dominance aircraft — designed to replace the FA-18 Hornet. Roper comes to his position in the Air Force after what has already been a long and storied career in the military. He previously served as the founding director in the Pentagon’s Strategic Capabilities Office. First created in 2012, the SCO was designed to imagine new applications for existing government and commercial systems. During his tenure, Roper grew the budget of the SCO from $50 million to $1.5 billion. Under the program Roper developed new concepts like hypervelocity artillery, multipurpose missiles, smartphone-navigating weapons, big-data-enabled sensing, 3D printed systems, fighter avatars and fighter-dispersed swarming microdrones. The breadth of Roper’s vision about the capabilities that the U.S. will need to compete in a 21st century combat scenario will likely be one of the subjects we discuss — as well as the role Roper sees for startups in developing those technologies. Those contributions could come through participation in programs like AFVentures , which paid out nearly $800 million to companies for programs like the Air Force’s flying car program, as well as the nation’s space launch program. “This is how we provide our forces the capabilities they’ll need to win on the unpredictable, rapidly evolving innovation battlefield in this century by fundamentally changing how we build and acquire systems and with whom we build them, so that no matter what our adversaries do in the future, we will have the agility to overmatch and win,” Roper told his audience in September. “Then we will innovate faster, we will adapt quicker and ultimately stay ahead to disrupt and win.” To hear Roper’s thoughts on the future of the Air Force’s technological innovations, you can grab a ticket to get exclusive access to watch this session (along with many others) live (with access to video on demand), network with the innovators changing the space industry, discover the hottest early-stage companies, learn how to score grants for your space company, recruit talent or even find a job.

Sign up here to receive it weekly on Sundays in your inbox . This past week, we unveiled the agenda for TC Sessions: Space for the first time. It’s our inaugural event focused on space startups and related technologies, and it’s happening December 16 and 17. It’s entirely virtual, of course, and the good news is that means you can attend easily from anywhere in the world. We’ve got an amazing lineup, including newsmakers we regularly cover here. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine will be there, as well as U.S. Space Force commanding office Jay Raymond, and Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck, to name just a few. Tickets are available now, so sign up ASAP to get the best price possible SpaceX launched not one, but two separate Falcon 9 rockets loaded with Starlink satellites for its broadband internet service last week. The first took off on October 19, then just five days later, another full complement reached orbit. SpaceX has now launched nearly 1,000 of these, and it must be getting awfully close to kicking off its public beta of the consumer-facing internet service. NASA has managed to collect a sample from the surface of an asteroid in a first for the agency. The sample collection came courtesy of NASA’s OSIRIS-REx robotic exploration probe, which was built by partner Lockheed Martin. OSIRIS-REx still has some work to do at Bennu, the asteroid from which it collected the sample, but next year it’ll begin heading back with its precious cargo intended for study by scientists here on Earth. NASA is full of special discoveries this week — scientists working on its SOFIA imaging project confirmed the presence of water on the surface of the moon that’s exposed to sunlight. They’d suspected it was there, but this is the first confirmed proof, and while it isn’t a whole lot of water, it could still change the future of human deep space exploration. NASA discovers water on the surface of the sunlit portion of the moon Microsoft looks primed to invest in space-based business in a big way with Azure Space, a new business unit it formed to handle all space-related businesses attached to its cloud data efforts. That includes a new type of deployable mobile data center that will be connected in part via SpaceX’s Starlink global broadband network, putting computing power near where it’s needed in a scalable way. Intel has loaded up a small satellite with a power-efficient edge AI processor, its Myriad 2 Vision Processing Unit. That’ll help the satellite do its own on-board classification of images of Earth that it takes, saving key bandwidth for what it transfers back to researchers on the ground. Local AI could help satellite networks in general operate much more efficiently, but it’s still in its infancy as a field. Intel is providing the smarts for the first satellite with local AI processing on board Relativity Space has tons of promise in terms of its 3D-printed rockets, but it still hasn’t actually reached the launch stage. It did however secure a key government contract, with Lockheed Martin selecting its rocket for a forthcoming mission to test fluid management systems for NASA.

This launch was all set to take off back at the beginning of October, but was scrubbed in the final seconds. Today’s launch window spans 15 minutes, and opens at 6:24 PM EST (3:24 PM PST), with a backup opportunity tomorrow, Friday November 6 at 6:20 PM EST (3:20 PM PST). The launch today will use a Falcon 9 first-stage that hasn’t flown previously, and SpaceX will be attempting to recover it with a landing on its drone ship “Of Course I Still Love You” in the Atlantic Ocean. Because of the terms of its agreement with the U.S. Space Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC, which was previously housed under the Air Force), SpaceX has had to use new boosters for all missions that fall under the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) umbrella, including this one. That changed in September of this year, when SpaceX and the SMC agreed that Elon Musk’s launch company could use re-flown booster stages — which is what SpaceX does for just about every other launch it flies these days. Given SpaceX’s track record with refurbished first stages, it makes sense that SMC would change their position on use of the recovered rockets. SpaceX already launched one GPS III spacecraft for the Space Force this year — the third such satellite in the constellation, which was delivered to orbit in June. SpaceX successfully launches GPS III space vehicle on behalf of the US Space Force The launch webcast will begin above at around 15 minutes prior to the opening of the launch window, so at around 6:09 PM EST (3:09 PM PST).

It’ll be a virtual, live-streamed two-day show, including conversations with some of the best and brightest in the space industry. We’re thrilled to be hosting Lisa Callahan, vice president and general manager of Commercial Civil Space at Lockheed Martin. She’ll join us to discuss her company’s history-making work in robotic space exploration — including the asteroid mining sample collection at asteroid Bennu that happened today — as well as the future of human space exploration. Callahan’s work at Lockheed covers all the work they do to support NASA and other civil exploration efforts of space, including both robotic and human transportation and science investigations. That includes OSIRIS-REx, the asteroid study and sample return mission that earlier today made a historic descent to the surface of rocky solar system visitor Bennu, an asteroid that’s over 200 thousand miles from Earth. OSIRIS-REx already made plenty of history, including becoming the closest orbit to an asteroid ever conducted by a spacecraft. But today it topped all of that with a “tap-and-go” descent to the rocky surface, scooping samples that it will now attempt to return to Earth for direct study by scientists. That’s exactly the kind of ambitious extra-planetary robotic research that Callahan and her division at Lockheed have made possible with their work in advanced spacecraft and robotics design. NASA’s OSIRIS-REx just snatched a rock sample from asteroid Bennu Callahan is also directly involved in NASA’s plans to return humans to the surface of the moon — including sending a woman on a lunar landing mission for the first time. Lockheed Martin is the manufacturing partner for NASA’s Orion lander, which will transport the first American woman and the next American man to the -oon for their historic mission in 2024. We’ll talk in December with Callahan about what these achievements mean for the space industry, and the future of space exploration — and human spaceflight.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/carvana-crashes-back-down-to-earth/,Carvana crashes back down to earth,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Carvana’s big rally is now looking more like a blip on the radar. Shares in the online-car retailer soared Thursday, closing up by 56% from the prior day on news that it expected to post $50 million worth of adjusted EBITDA in the current quarter, powered by stronger per-car sales profitability. For Carvana, the gains were a welcome turnaround. The company, which once had stock prices as high as $360 in 2021, had experienced a steady decline down to the single digits. However, despite topping $25 per share on Thursday in the wake of its profit update, shares of Carvana closed at $19.07 today, erasing much of its recent gains. Carvana’s debt and declining revenue, and the cool response it got from industry analysts, eclipsed the company’s sunny profit predictions. There was also concern that the company’s adjusted profitability result was a one-time affair. Other commentary echoed what TechCrunch wrote yesterday : Carvana’s boosted profitability was coming on the back of falling revenues. At current count, Wall Street analysts expect Carvana to report revenues of $2.57 billion in the second quarter and $2.63 billion in Q3. Those figures compare poorly when placed next to 2022’s Q2 and Q3 revenue results of $3.88 billion and $3.39 billion, respectively. Carvana is a deeply indebted company, with long-term debt of more than $6.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. With gross profit of a few hundred million per quarter at current count, and negative operating cash flow of $66 million in Q1 2023, the company has an uphill road ahead of it. Carvana launched in 2013, calling itself the “first complete online auto retailer.” At the time, co-founder Ernie Garcia III said the company had cut out the physical overhead associated with traditional dealerships, replacing it with “consumer-friendly technology” and offering 360-degree interior and exterior views of its inventory. Carvana embraced physical retail spaces in 2015, albeit in a novel way, via multi-story “ car vending machines .” In the years since, Carvana secured billions in equity and debt financing, and it bought a couple of startups — namely, Car360 and Adesa . Through it all, the company has yet to record a real profit. Certainly, better per-sale profitability and improved adjusted profits for the second quarter are welcome — as evidenced by investors’ initial reaction yesterday. However, it’s not clear if Carvana’s long-term trajectory has changed enough to warrant a whole-cloth repricing. Cooler, or more cynical, heads seem to have prevailed today. Still, Carvana, at around $19 per share, is worth close to a third more than it was before it dropped its latest news. That’s a win for the company no matter how you slice it.

That makes 835 Starlink satellites launched thus far, though not all of those are operational (some were test satellites that were intentionally decommissioned). The launch, from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center, also included a successful controlled landing and recovery of the first-stage booster, as well as a semi-successful dual catch of the fairing halves used to protect the cargo during launch. I say semi-successful because both of SpaceX’s recovery barges actually did catch the fairing halves as they parachuted back down to the surface of the Atlantic Ocean, but one of the nets on the barges gave way during the catch. SpaceX says the recovery crew is fine, but that’s obviously not an ideal outcome. Still, being positioned correctly to catch both fairing halves is definitely a win for the company’s efforts on that aspect of Falcon 9 launch vehicle reusability. This is another impressive show of SpaceX’s ability to maintain a very fast and frequent pace of launches, which has this year focused mostly on delivering its own Starlink satellites to orbit. The company has already launched almost 300 new Starlink satellites since June, and has plans to launch at least two more batches during the next month, including a tentative launch scheduled for this coming Wednesday. Starlink is already in the process of being tested internally by SpaceX employees and technicians, and the company is readying for a broader public beta to begin before the end of this year.

It’s a custom-made, 3D camera designed to capture content in 360-degrees while in space, and it will be used to film a spacewalk in immersive, cinematic VR for the first time ever on an upcoming ISS astronaut mission. The camera is the result of a collaboration between Felix & Paul Studios, Time Studios and in-space technology expert Nanoracks. It will ultimately be used to capture the footage that will then be used to produce a culminating episode of a series called “Space Explorers: The ISS Series.” To do that, it’ll be mounted on Nanoracks’ Kaber MicroSatellite deployer device, which will provide it with power, and allow it to be controlled via the Canadarm2 robotic arm that the ISS uses for manipulating external cargo. The team behind this says that the Canadian-made robot arm will essentially be used like a crane on a film set to capture the spacewalk of two ISS astronauts. In terms of specs, the VR camera includes nine 4K sensors, which can then stitch together a fully immersive 360-degree final image that’s rendered at 8K resolution. The camera, a Z-Cam V1 Pro, has been modified by Nanoracks using their expertise in creating equipment that can operate in and withstand the harsh environment of space — meaning it isn’t all that bothered by vacuum, UV radiation, ionizing radiation, plasma, wildly varying extreme temps that can go from -250 degrees Fahrenheit to +250 depending on sun exposure, and more. The enclosure for the camera is hermitically sealed, includes an aluminum radiation shield, and has both an active heating and passive cooling system, rendering it capable of surviving exposure to space for a full week. The spacewalk will ultimately be aired via the Oculus Store, and you can already see the first two Space Explorers episodes there right now if you have a compatible VR headset.

The company aims to offer low-cost launch services for small satellites, using its mid-air launch vehicle which is carried to a high altitude by a modified version of a traditional commercial jet. This launch will hopefully mark a first for Virgin Orbit — the first time it has reached orbit, which is where it needs to be to provide the services it hopes to offer. CNBC spoke to Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart, who said that the December target is based on where they are right now with the construction of a new LauncherOne rocket to fly the test mission. LauncherOne is docked with Virgin Orbit’s carrier craft for its launch model, which is a modified 747. The jet takes it up to around 45,000 feet, at which point it drops the rocket, which ignites its own engines after separation and then flies under its own power the rest of the way to space. A rocket has a much easier time leaving Earth’s atmosphere from that altitude, which is why Virgin hopes to be able to offer big cost benefits for dedicated small launch services versus what’s available now. Virgin’s first launch went smoothly up until just after the LauncherOne craft used on that mission fired up its engines. There was a failure that caused the engines to cut off because of a safety shutoff, and the rocket then safely fell back to Earth, but was obviously lost. Virgin Orbit’s first orbital test flight cut short after rocket released from carrier aircraft Such a mishap on a first orbital launch attempt is far from unusual — in fact, it’s almost the norm. Virgin Orbit said they gleaned a lot of great data from their attempt regardless of the outcome, and hopefully that will mean this next try goes to plan. If it does, that should put the company on track to begin offering commercial service next year. Meanwhile, CNBC reports that the company is also in the process of tracking down up to $150 million in new funding, echoing an earlier report from The Wall Street Journal this week.

Today’s launch is a mission for the company’s New Shepard reusable sub-orbital rocket — a record-setting sixth flight for this particular rocket, which first flew and landed back in December 2017. Today’s launch includes a system design to test elements of NASA’s Deorbit, Descent and Landing Sensor technology, which will provide key automation for use in future landers for the moon and Mars that will be able to intelligently identify and avoid potential hazards on target landing zones. This test will include recovery of both the rocket and the capsule for the New Shepard launch vehicle. The rocket will land back at the West Texas launch and landing site with a controlled, engine-powered descent, and the capsule will descend via parachute. The capsule will contain a variety of experiments and other payloads, including postcards from Blue Origin’s nonprofit organization Club for the Future provided by children from across the country.

Founded by two childhood friends, Araz Feyzi and Siamak Hesar, who grew up in Iran and immigrated to the U.S. for college, Kayhan is tackling one of the toughest problems that the space industry will confront in the coming years — how to manage the exponentially increasing traffic that will soon crowd outer space. There are currently around 8,000 satellites in orbit around the earth, but over the next several years, Amazon will launch 3,236 satellites for its Kuiper Network , while SpaceX filed paperwork last year to launch up to 30,000 satellites. That’s a lot of metal flying around. And somebody needs to make sure that those satellites don’t crash into each other, because space junk has a whole other set of problems . SpaceX files paperwork to launch up to 30,000 more Starlink global internet satellites In some ways, Feyzi and Hesar are a perfect pair to solve the problem. Hesar, the company’s co-founder and chief executive, has spent years studying space travel, receiving a master’s degree from the University of Southern California in aeronautics, and a doctorate in astronautical engineering from the University of Colorado, Boulder. He interned at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and spent three years at Colorado-based satellite situational awareness and systems control technology developers like SpaceNav and Blue Canyon Technologies. Meanwhile, Feyzi is a serial entrepreneur who co-founded a company in the Atlanta area called Syfer, which developed technologies to secure internet-enabled consumer devices. Using Hesar’s proprietary algorithms based on research from his doctoral days at UC Boulder and Feyzi’s expertise in cloud computing, the company has developed a system that can predict and alert the operators of satellite networks when there’s the potential for a collision and suggest alternative paths to avoid an accident. It’s a problem that the two founders say can’t be solved by automation on satellites alone, thanks to the complexity and multidimensional nature of the work. “Imagine that a U.S. commercial satellite is on a collision course with a Russian military satellite,” Feyzi said. “Who needs to maneuver? We make sure the satellite operator has all the information available to them [including] here’s what we know about the collision about to happen here and here are the recommendations and options to avoid it.” Satellites today aren’t equipped to visualize their surroundings and autonomy won’t solve a problem that includes geopolitical complexities and dumb space debris all creating a morass that requires human intervention to navigate, the founders said. “ Today it’s too complex to resolve and because of the different nations and lack of standards and policy … today you need human input,” Hesar said. And in the future, if satellites are equipped with sensors to make collision avoidance more autonomous, then Kayhan Space already has the algorithms that can provide that service. “If you think of the system and the sensors and the decision-making and [execution controls] actually performing that action… we are that,” Hesar said. “We have the algorithm whether it uses the ground-based sensor or the space-based sensor.” Techstars launches a virtual space tech accelerator with USAF, the Netherlands and Norway Over the next eight years the space situational market is expected to reach $3.9 billion and there are very few companies equipped to provide the kind of traffic control systems that satellite network operators will need, the founders said. Their argument was compelling enough to gain admission to the Techstars Allied Space Accelerator , an early-stage investment and mentoring program developed by Techstars and the U.S. Air Force, the Netherlands Ministry of Defence, the Norwegian Ministry of Defence and the Norwegian Space Agency. And, as first reported in Hypeotamus , the company has now raised $600,000 in a pre-seed funding from investors including the Atlanta-based pre-seed investment firm, Overline , to grow its business. And the company realizes that money and technology can’t solve the problem alone. “We believe that technology alone can help but can’t solve this problem. We need the U.S. to take the lead [on policy] globally,” said Feyzi. “Unlike airspace… which is controlled by countries. Space is space.” Hesar agreed. “T here needs to be a focused effort on this problem.” Topics Writer Jonathan was an editor at TechCrunch./p> LIMITED TIME: Save $300+ on your ticket, plus an additional 50% on a second for a full immersive day of AI!

This particular rocket has flown a total of seven times (including today), and this is now the 13th flight of a New Shepard vehicle overall. Today’s launch included a test of NASA’s active landing sensor system, which will be used to build an autonomous, precise and flexible landing system for future moon landing vehicles. The NASA landing system test also marks a first for Blue Origin — the first time it has tested flying a payload on the outside of New Shepard. To date, all New Shepard payloads have traveled inside the capsule atop the booster, but the external test here was necessary in order to perform measurements of the instruments that will be used to provide repeatable, precision landing capabilities to future spacecraft. Learn how the @NASA lunar landing sensor demo on #NewShepard tests precision landing tech for future missions to the Moon in support of #Artemis .

Watch: pic.twitter.com/vrUzLGadgS — Blue Origin (@blueorigin) October 13, 2020 While NASA was obviously previously able to land on the surface of the moon, it’s looking to upgrade the technology it uses to do so in order to be able to handle the challenging task with full automation, and with much higher precision for hitting very specific targets on the lunar surface — and providing spacecraft the ability to do so over and over again, reliably, since NASA’s goal with its Artemis generation of moon missions is to establish a more permanent human research presence on our large natural satellite. A number of experiments are also on board that capsule, which returned to Earth with a soft, parachute-aided landing. This launch also included a new heat shield used on the rocket as part of testing for future New Glenn flights, the next generation of Blue Origin spacecraft that will be able to handle orbital payload launches, adding to Blue Origin’s current suborbital capabilities with New Shepard.

The 8:19 PM PT lift-off of Astra’s ‘Rocket 3.1’ test vehicle went well – but the flight ended relatively shortly after that, during the first-stage engine burn and long before reaching orbit. Astra wasn’t expecting to actually reach orbit on this particular flight – it has always said that its goal is to reach orbit within three test flights of Rocket, and prior to this first mission, said that the main goal was to have a good first-stage burn on this one specifically. This wasn’t a nominal first-stage burn, of course, since that’s when the failure occurred, but the company still noted in a blog post that “the rocket performed very well” according to their first reviews of the data. pic.twitter.com/PGYv26ZqrF — Jennifer Culton (@CultonJennifer) September 12, 2020 The mission ended early because of what appears to be a bit of unwanted back-and-forth wobbling in the rocket as it ascended, Astra said, which caused an engine shutdown by the vehicle’s automated safety system. That’s actually also good news, since it means the steps Astra has taken to ensure safe failures are also working as designed. You can see in the video above that the light of the rocket’s engines simply go out during flight, and then some time later there’s a fireball from its impact on the ground. It’s worth noting that most first flights of entirely new rockets don’t go entirely as planned – including those by SpaceX, whose founder and CEO Elon Musk expressed his encouragement to the Astra team on Twitter. Likewise, Rocket Lab’s Peter Beck also chimed in with support. Not to mention that Astra has been operating under extreme conditions, with just a six-person team on the ground in Alaska to deploy the launch system, which was set up in under a week, due to the COVID-19 crisis. Astra will definitely be able to get a lot of valuable data out of this launch that it can use to put towards improving the chances of its next try going well. The company notes that it expects to review said data “over the next several weeks” as it proceeds towards the second flight in this series of three attempts. Rocket 3.2, the test article for that mission, is already completed and awaiting that try.

U-Shift is a fully electric vehicle, designed for autonomous operation, and could serve in a number of capacities, including as an on-demand shuttle, a bus, a mobile distribution center for package delivery or even as a traveling salesroom. As you can see from the images, the base of the U-Shift itself is pretty simple, containing the wheels, drive system and batteries. DLR envisions a modular top component that can be swapped out depending on usage needs, with various add-on units depicted, including an airy, all-glass bus, and a more bare-bones cargo capsule. This modularity could help the U-Shift better address the varied needs of city-based transportation, with the flexibility to shift modes relatively easily depending on what’s going on at the time. You could easily see how a fleet like this could be repurposed for on-demand package and grocery delivery during lockdowns like the ones that have been required during the COVID-19 pandemic, when personal transportation is less needed. This prototype is functional, but it’s not autonomous — it’s remote-controlled instead. The top speed also isn’t that high, but it is capable of operating continuously for 24 hours when necessary. The primary purpose of this prototype is to test the system that swaps out the cargo/passenger capsules in order to chart a path toward production with companies that will be supplying those, and to study its user interface, including things like how the doors open and how accessible it is. DLR plans to use all the information it gathers from testing of this prototype to help develop a second, fully automated version that can reach speeds of up to 60 km/h (just under 40 mph) by 2024. That next prototype should be much closer to any potential production version, and there will be more focus then on business opportunities and commercialization, as well.

The New Zealand launch company quietly included its first fully functioning satellite next to its paying customer’s payload. First Light, as it’s called, is a sort of tech demo intended to show how access to orbit doesn’t have to be, as CEO and founder Peter Beck put it, “kind of a pain in the butt.” Rocket Lab has telegraphed this move for some time; the Photon satellite platform was announced early last year, and in March it acquired spacecraft maker Sinclair Interplanetary . It was just a matter of when the company would choose to press the button, and it has now done so. As Beck explained in a live broadcast today (now that First Light has successfully deployed into orbit), the company felt that “access to space” is, in many ways and despite the inherent risks, a solved problem. The next biggest pain point, he said, is that “it’s just really painful to go from an idea to getting something in orbit.” It’s cause for celebration, he said, when a project can go from idea to orbit in 18 months. That’s far too slow to keep up with innovation on the ground, especially for startups, which may not have 18 months of runway. “We need to fix that,” Beck said. Photon and First Light represent Rocket Lab’s new business proposition of providing a flexible platform for a modern satellite, and one that fits hand-in-glove with its Electron launch vehicle and other services. Acting as a partner throughout the process rather than just the launch provider is of course more work and money for Rocket Lab, and if things go well it could be much faster and cheaper for the customer as well. There will be other, new versions of Photon as well, as cislunar and interplanetary space become targets for Electron launches. Rocket Lab is already signed on for a lunar mission, NASA’s experimental CAPSTONE craft , which will be based on Photon and help clear the way for later Artemis missions.

https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/spacex-completes-another-successful-short-test-flight-of-its-starship-spacecraft-prototype/,SpaceX completes another successful short test flight of its Starship spacecraft prototype,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us SpaceX has done it again — a second “hop” flight in less than a month for its Starship prototype. This was a 150 meter (just under 500 foot) test flight from its Boca Chica, Texas development site. The prototype used in this instance was SN6, a more recent model than the SN5 test article that SpaceX used to complete a similar test at the beginning of August. The hop flight is a key part of its testing program for Starship, and its Raptor engine. These prototypes are equipped with only one such engine, but the final production version will have six, including three designed to fly in Earth’s atmosphere, and three to be used while the vehicle is in space. SpaceX accomplishing two of these flights with a controlled, upright landing in rapid succession is a very good sign for the spacecraft’s development program, since there have been a number of previous prototypes which never made it to this point. Earlier versions encountered pressurization failures under load when simulating what the conditions would be with fuel on board. SpaceX successfully flies its Starship prototype to a height of around 500 feet These short hops help SpaceX gather data bout Raptor performance, as well as the performance of a full-sized prototype Starship (though without elements including the nosecone and eventual landing legs). All of this will inform later tests, including a much higher sub-orbital atmospheric flight intended to go around as high as commercial airplanes fly, and eventually, the first orbital Starship launch, which is currently likely to take place next year at the earliest. SpaceX is pursuing a rapid iteration development plan for Starship, creating multiple generations of prototype at once at its Boca Chica site, with the aim of testing and improving the design quickly, while also learning from failures. The goal had been to fly Starship’s first operational missions sometime next year, but it will be incredibly impressive if the company manages that, considering where they are in the rocket’s development cycle.

Recently, SpaceX has completed short, 150-meter (just under 500 feet) test flights of two earlier Starship prototypes, SN5 and SN6. SN8, whose construction is currently set to be complete “in about a week” according to Musk, will have “flaps & nosecone” and ultimately is intended for a much higher altitude test launch. The prototypes that SpaceX has flown and landed for its so-called ‘short-hop’ tests over the past few weeks have been full-sized, but with a simulated weight installed on the top in place of the actual domed nosecone that will perch atop the final production Starship and protect any cargo on board. SN5 and SN6, which are often compared to grain silos, are also lacking the large control flaps on either side of the nosecone that will help control its flight. SN8 will have both, according to Musk. This version of the prototype will also undergo the same early testing and its precursors, including a static fire and other ground checkouts, followed by another static fire before ultimately attempting to fly to an altitude of 60,000 feet – and then returning back to the ground for a controlled landing. What’s next for space tech? 9 VCs look to the future SpaceX is off pace when it comes to Starship development relative to Musk’s earliest, rosiest projections – but the CEO is known for overly optimistic estimates when it comes to timeframes, something he’s repeatedly copped to himself. Rocket development is also notoriously difficult, so this first high-altitude flight attempt could just as easily go very poorly. SpaceX in particular has a development program that focuses on rapid iteration, and learning from earlier mistakes while building simultaneous development prototypes incorporating different lessons gleaned from various generations. And while it may not have made Musk’s crazy timelines, it is moving very quickly, especially now that the most recent prototypes have survived pressure testing and made it up into the air.

It’s called the Escalade IQ, which follows the same name scheme used by the rest of the Cadillac fleet of Lyriq, Celestiq, Mystiq, Vistiq and Lumistiq. Why the IQ at the end? Cadillac says “The IQ naming strategy celebrates Cadillac introducing a different type of EV to the market — one that works in tandem with people’s daily lives and environments.” Okay, sure. No other details about the upcoming vehicle were released, including vehicle features, electric range or pricing. Those details will likely be released later this year. Let’s speculate! The Escalade IQ will likely be built off the next generation Ultium platform, the same modular EV platform used in every modern GM EV from the sporty Blazer EV to the monstrous Hummer EV. Last week, General Motors’ newly named president of North America, Rory Harvey, told the media the upcoming Silverado EV will feature a 450-mile range. There’s a good chance the Escalade IQ will feature a similar range. Don’t expect a bargain. General Motors and Cadillac have shown recently it’s able to price its vehicles at the top of their range. Cadillac’s upcoming flagship EV sedan , the Celestiq, will start around $300,000 , though will likely be less available and more exclusive than the Escalade IQ. The GMC Hummer EV often sells north of $150,000 (if you can find one). The same goes for the mid-engine Corvette C8, which technically starts at $65,000, but a lot are sold well above the window price, with some climbing north of $150,000. Think the Escalade IQ will be too expensive for your budget? There will likely be a lower-cost alternative, too: The Chevy Suburban. The current Cadillac Escalade and Chevrolet Suburban are nearly twins with similar capabilities and near-identical dimensions. That’s by design. The Cadillac Escalade nameplate has been atop the Cadillac lineup since the late ’90s. At the time, when gas was cheap and the market craved huge SUVs, General Motors saw an opportunity to print money. The automaker took its full-size SUVs, the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, and upgraded the interior with better seats and softer leather and slapped the Cadillac crest on the tailgate. The result was a success, and it’s been a top-seller since its debut. Now, with its Ultium platform, General Motors is likely to produce a luxury, full-size SUV (the Escalade IQ) and a pedestrian version in the Chevy Suburban.

The company has built a number of different Starship prototypes to date, include one prior version called the Starhopper that was essentially just the bottom portion of the rocket. Today, the company flew its first full-scale prototype (minus the domed cap that will appear on the final version, and without the control fins that will appear lower down on its sides), achieving an initial flight of around 150 m (just under 500 feet). This is the furthest along one of these prototypes has come in the testing process. It’s designated Starship SN5, which is the fifth serialized test article. SpaceX actually built a first full-scale demonstration craft called the Starship Mk1 prior to switching to this new naming scheme, so that makes this the sixth one this size they’ve built — with the prior versions suffering failures at various points during preparations, including pressure testing and following a static engine test fire. SN5 is now the first of these larger test vehicles to actually take off and fly. This prototype underwent a successful static test fire earlier this week, paving the way for this short flight test today. It’s equipped with just one Raptor engine, whereas the final Starship will have six Raptors on board for much greater thrust. It managed to fly and land upright, which means that by all external indications everything went to plan. Starhopper previously completed a similar hop in August of 2019. SpaceX has an aggressive prototype development program to attempt to get Starship in working order, with the ambitious goal of flying payloads using the functional orbital vehicle as early as next year. Ultimately, Starship is designed to pair with a future Falcon Heavy booster to carry large payloads to orbit around Earth, as well as to the moon and eventually to Mars.

The Redmond-based company has developed a new type of smart, powered, flat-panel antenna that can be used to vastly improve satellite and cellular connection signal strength. Kymeta’s new funding is intended to help it continue with new product development efforts, and also to speed the commercialization of its technology. Since its debut in 2015, Kymeta has productized its technology and added a significant number of customers, particularly in industries like defense, mobility and public safety. The company’s tech is electronically steered and requires no moving parts to operate, which is a huge advantage over traditional satellite reception dishes — particularly in applications like on aircraft, on ships and in other transportation methods where having a satellite dish attached to the outside of your vehicle doesn’t make any sense or is impossible. Kymeta’s tech also has significant potential advantages when it comes to working with the new generation of low Earth orbit communications satellite constellations that are coming online today and in the near future. Because of the dynamic nature of its flat-panel antennas, it can track and adjust position when maintaining connection with these satellites as they move across the sky — a task that requires more flexibility when compared to maintaining connections with the large, fixed-position geostationary communications satellites that form the backbone of legacy satellites internet networks.

For the first time in human history, we are not merely exploring a new landmass. We, as a biological species, are advancing to a new element — the cosmos. The whole history of humanity is the story of our struggle with space and time. Mastering new horizons, moving ever farther; driven by the desire for a better life or for profit, out of fear or out of sheer curiosity, people found ever faster, easier, cheaper and safer ways to conquer the space between here and there. When, at the beginning of the 19th century, Thomas Jefferson bought Louisiana from Napoleon, actually having doubled the territory of the United States at that time, he believed it would take thousands of years for settlers to populate these spaces in the center of the continent. But after just a few decades, the discovery of gold in California mobilized huge masses of industrious people, created incentives for capital and demanded new technologies. As countless wagons of newcomers moved through the land, threads of railways were stretched coast to coast, cities and settlements arose, and what Jefferson envisioned more than 200 years ago was actualized — and in the span of just one human life. Growing up in a small Mongolian village near where Genghis Khan began the 13th-century journey that resulted in the largest contiguous land empire in history, I acquired an early interest in the history of explorers. Spending many long Siberian winter twilights reading books about great geographical discoveries, I bemoaned fate for placing me in a dull era in which all new lands had been discovered and all frontiers had been mapped. Little did I know that only a few decades later, I would be living through the most exciting time for human exploration the world had ever seen. In recent years, the entire space industry has been waiting and looking for what will serve as the gold rush of space. One could talk endlessly about the importance of space for humanity and how technologies developed by and for space activity help to solve problems on Earth: satellite imagery, weather, television, communications. But without a real “space fever” — without the short-term insanity that will pour enormous financial resources, entrepreneurial energy and engineering talent into the space industry, it will not be possible to spark a new “space race.” Presently, the entire space economy — including rockets, communications, imagery, satellites and crewed flights — does not exceed $100 billion, which is less than 0.1% of the global economy. For comparison: during the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s, the total capitalization of companies in this sector amounted to more than 5% of global GDP. The influence of the California Gold Rush in the 1850s was so significant that it changed the entire U.S. economy, essentially creating a new economic center on the West Coast. The current size of the space economy is not enough to cause truly tectonic shifts in the global economy. What candidates do we have for this place in the 21st century? We are all witnesses to the deployment of space internet megaconstellations, such as Starlink from SpaceX, Kuiper from Amazon and a few other smaller players. But is this market enough to create a real gold rush? The size of the global telecommunications market is an impressive $1.5 trillion (or almost 1.5% of the global economy). If a number of factors coincide — a sharp increase in the consumption of multimedia content by unmanned car passengers, rapid growth in the Internet of Things segment — satellite telecommunications services can grow in the medium term to 1 trillion or more. Then, there is reason to believe that this segment may be the driver of the growth when it comes to the space economy. This, of course, is not 5% (as was the case during the dot-com era), but it is already an impressive 1% of the world economy. But despite all the importance of telecommunications, satellite imagery and navigation, these are the traditional space applications that have been used for many decades since the beginning of the space era. What they have in common is that these are high value-added applications, often with no substitutes on the ground. Earth surveillance and global communications are difficult to do from anywhere but space. Therefore, the high cost of space assets, caused primarily by the high cost of launch and historically amounting to tens of thousands of dollars per kilogram, was the main obstacle to space applications of the past. For the true industrialization of space and for the emergence of new space services and products (many of which will replace ones that are currently produced on Earth), a revolution is needed in the cost of launching and transporting cargo in space. The mastering of new territories is impossible to imagine without transport. The invention and proliferation of new means of moving people and goods — such as railways, aviation, containers — has created the modern economy that we know. Space exploration is not an exception. But the physical nature of this territory creates enormous challenges. Here on Earth, we are at the bottom of a huge gravity well. To deliver the cargo into orbit and defeat gravity, you need to accelerate things to the prodigious velocity of 8 km/s — 10-20 times faster than a bullet. Less than 5% of a rocket’s starting mass reaches orbit. The answer, then, lies in reusability and in mass production. The tyranny of rocket science’s Tsiolkovsky equation also contributes to the large rocket sizes that are necessary. It drives the strategies for companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin, who are developing large, even gigantic, reusable rockets such as Starship or New Glenn. We’ll soon see that the cost of launching into space will be even less than a few hundred U.S. dollars per kg. But rockets are effective only for launching huge masses into low-Earth orbits. If you need to distribute cargo into different orbits or deliver it to the very top of the gravity well — high orbits, such as GEO, HEO, Lagrange points or moon orbit — you need to add even more delta velocity. It is another 3-6 km/sec or more. If you use conventional rockets for this, the proportion of the mass removed is reduced from 5% to less than 1%. In many cases, if the delivered mass is much less than the capabilities of huge low-cost rockets, you need to use much more expensive (per kg of transported cargo) small and medium launchers. This requires multimodal transportation, with huge cheap rockets delivering cargo to low-Earth orbits and then last-mile space tugs distributing cargo between target orbits, to higher orbits, to the moon and to other planets in our solar system. This is why Momentus, the company I founded in 2017 developing space tugs for “hub-and-spoke” multimodal transportation to space, is flying its first commercial mission in December 2020 on a Falcon 9 ride-share flight. Initially, space tugs can use propellant delivered from Earth. But an increase in the scale of transportation in space, as well as demand to move cargo far from low-Earth orbit, creates the need to use a propellant that we can get not from the Earth’s surface but from the moon, from Mars or from asteroids — including near-Earth ones. Fortunately, we have a gift given to us by the solar system’s process of evolution — water. Among probable rocket fuel candidates, water is the most widely spread in the solar system. Water has been found on the moon; in craters in the vicinity of the poles, there are huge reserves of ice. On Mars, under the ground, there is a huge ocean of frozen water. We have a vast asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. At the dawn of the formation of the solar system, the gravitational might of Jupiter prevented one planet from forming, scattering fragments in the form of billions of asteroids, most of which contain water. The same gravity power of Jupiter periodically “throws out” asteroids into the inner part of the solar system, forming a group of near-Earth asteroids. Tens of thousands of near-Earth asteroids are known, of which almost a thousand are more than 1 km in diameter. From the point of view of celestial mechanics, it is much easier to deliver water from asteroids or from the moon than from Earth. Since Earth has a powerful gravitational field, the payload-to-initial-mass ratio delivered to the very top of the gravitational well (geostationary orbit, Lagrange points or the lunar orbit) is less than 1%; whereas from the surface of the moon you can deliver 70% of the original mass, and from an asteroid 99%. This is one of the reasons why at Momentus we’re using water as a propellant for our space tugs. We developed a novel plasma microwave propulsion system that can use solar power as an energy source and water as a propellant (simply as a reaction mass) to propel our vehicle in space. The choice of water also makes our space vehicles extremely cost-effective and simple. The proliferation of large, reusable, low-cost rockets and in-space last-mile delivery opens up opportunities that were not possible within the old transportation price range. We assume that the price to deliver cargo to almost any point in cislunar space, from low-Earth orbit to low-lunar orbit will be well below $1,000/kg within 5-10 years. What is most exciting is that it opens up an opportunity to introduce an entirely new class of space applications, beyond traditional communication, observation and navigation; applications that will start the true industrialization of space and catalyze the process of Earth industry migration into space. Now, let’s become space futurists, and try to predict future candidates for a space gold rush in the next 5-10 years. What will be the next frontier’s applications, enabled by low-cost space transportation? There are several candidates for trillion-dollar businesses in space . Energy generation is the first and largest candidate for the gold rush, as the energy share of the global economy is about 8.2%. Power generation in space has several fantastic advantages. First, it is a continuity of power generation. In space, our sun is a large thermonuclear reactor that runs 24/7. There’s no need to store electricity at night and in bad weather. As a result, the same surface collects 10 times more energy per 24 hours than on Earth. This is not intuitively obvious, but the absence of twilights or nighttime, and the lack of clouds, atmosphere or accumulating dust create unique conditions for the production of electricity. Due to microgravity, space power plants with much lighter structures can eventually be much less costly than terrestrial plants. The energy can be beamed to the ground via microwaves or lasers. There are, however, at least two major challenges to building space power stations that still need to be resolved. The first is the cost of launching into space, and then the cost of transportation within space. The combination of huge rockets and reusable space tugs will reduce the cost of transporting goods from Earth to optimal orbits up to several hundred dollars per kilogram, which will make the share of transportation less than one cent per kilowatt-hour. The second problem is the amount of propellant you’ll need to stabilize vast panels that will be pushed away by solar radiation pressure. For every 1 gigawatt of power generation capacity, you’ll need 500-1,000 tons of propellant per year. So to have the same generation capacity as the U.S. (1,200 GW), you’ll need up to 1 million tons of propellant per year (eight launches of Falcon 9 per hour or one launch of Starship per hour). Power generation will be the largest consumer of the propellant in cislunar space, but the delivery of propellant from Earth will be too economically inefficient. The answer lies on the moon, where 40 permanently darkened craters near the north pole contain an estimated 600 million metric tonnes of ice. That alone will be enough for many hundreds of years of space power operations. Centers for data computation and processing are one of the largest and fastest-growing consumers of energy on Earth. Efficiency improvements implemented over the last decade have only increased the demand for large cloud-based server farms. The United States’ data centers alone consume about 70 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. Aside from the power required to operate the systems that process and store data, there is an enormous cost in energy and environmental impact to cool those systems, which translates directly to dollars spent both by governments and private industry. Regardless of how efficiently they are operated, the expansion of data centers alongside demands for increased power consumption is not sustainable, economically or environmentally. Instead of beaming energy to the ground via microwaves or lasers, energy can be used for data processing in space. It is much easier to stream terabytes and petabytes from space than gigawatts. Power-hungry applications like AI can be easily moved to space because most of them are tolerant of latency. Eventually, asteroids and the moon will be the main mining provinces for humanity as a space species. Rare and precious metals, construction materials, and even regolith will be used in the building of the new space economy, space industrialization and space habitats. But the first resource that will be mined from the moon or asteroids will be water — it will be the “oil” of the future space economy. In addition to the fact that water can be found on asteroids and other celestial bodies, it is quite easy to extract. You simply need heat to melt ice or extract water from hydrates. Water can be easily stored without cryogenic systems (like liquid oxygen or hydrogen), and it doesn’t need high-pressure tanks (like noble gases — propellant for ion engines). At the same time, water is a unique propellant for different propulsion technologies. It can be used as water in electrothermal rocket engines (like Momentus’ microwave electrothermal engines) or can be separated into hydrogen and oxygen for chemical rocket engines. The disruption of in-space transportation costs can make space a new industrial belt for humanity. Microgravity can support creating new materials for terrestrial applications like optical fiber, without the tiny flaws that inevitably emerge during production in a strong gravity field. These flaws increase signal loss and cause large attenuation of the transmitted light. Also, microgravity can be used in the future space economy to build megastructures for power generation, space hotels for tourists and eventually human habitats. In space, you can easily have a vacuum that would be impossible to achieve on Earth. This vacuum will be extremely valuable for the production of ultrapure materials like crystals, wafers and entirely new materials. The reign of in-space manufacturing will have begun when the main source of raw materials is not Earth, but asteroids or the moon, and the main consumers are in-space industry. The future market opportunities enabled by the disruption in space transportation are enormous. Even without space tourism, space habitats will be almost a two trillion dollar market in 10-15 years. Undoubtedly, it will lead to a space gold rush that will drive human civilization’s development for generations to come. I studied in high school during the last years of the Soviet Union. The Soviet economy was collapsing, we had no sanitation in the house, and quite often we had no electricity. During those dark evenings, I studied physics and mathematics books by the light of a kerosene lamp. We had a good community library, and I could order books and magazines from larger libraries in the big cities, like Novosibirsk or Moscow. It was my window into the world. It was awesome. I was reading about the flights of the Voyager spacecraft, and about the exploration of the solar system, and I was thinking about my future. That was the time when I realized that I both love and excel in science and math, and I decided then to become a space engineer. In an interview with a local newspaper back in 1993, I told the reporter, “I want to study advanced propulsion technologies. I dream about the future, where I can be part of space exploration and may even fly to Mars … .” And now that future is coming.

Sign up here to receive it weekly on Sundays in your inbox . It wasn’t the busiest week in space tech news — much like a lot of the industry, it feels like we’re entering into a bit of a summer doldrums period, when things slow down considerably. That’s probably especially true right now, with a lot of companies coming off some Herculean efforts and big successes. This down time will lead to big developments to come, including the first official International Space Station crew mission for SpaceX’s Dragon capsule, which is scheduled to take place toward the end of September. We might also see Blue Origin’s first sub-orbital launch of the year in the same month. SpaceX had a successful launch of a batch of 57 more Stalrink satellites for its broadband internet satellite constellation, which is coming together nicely ahead of the planned beta launch this summer. SpaceX has been gearing up for that, and the details we’ve found reveal that it should be getting underway anytime — though we’re unlikely to hear much about how the actual service works, as participation includes agreeing to an NDA. SpaceX has flown a full-scale prototype of its Starship for the first time, hopping a long fuselage (with a simulated weight instead of its eventual dome cap, and temp legs) to a height of around 500 feet. The hop included a flight up and then a controlled descent and landing, all of which appeared to have gone very smoothly. This is the first significant forward progress the Starship development program has had this year, really, after a series of (likely very educational) failures. Rocket Lab has increased the payload capacity of its Electron launch vehicle by a third, bumping the total weight it can carry to orbit up to 660 lbs. That should open up a lot of new potential market for the company, and make it possible for small satellite makers to build additional functionality into the spacecraft they’re putting up with the rocket. The company did this mid-product generation thanks to optimizations of the battery tech that powers some of its thrusters, along with some other tweaks. Netflix’s new show “Away” stars Hilary Swank as an astronaut on a mission to Mars, and seems to focus on the family challenges she encounters between her crucial mission and the people she left behind back on Earth. Looks like more “This Is Us” and less “The Martian,” but it could be great.

https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/blackskys-latest-satellites-return-images-just-58-hours-after-spacex-launch/,BlackSky’s latest satellites return images just 58 hours after SpaceX launch,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us There’s an increasing demand for fast turnaround time in the satellite imaging industry, especially among clients across government and defense, who want responsive, near-real time performance because of how quickly situations on the ground can develop and change. BlackSky, a sensor and satellite-based monitoring technology company, has broken new ground in terms of responsiveness by delivering photos from its newly launched satellites within 58 hours. BlackSky was able to photograph images of Port Elizabeth in South Africa just over two days after launch, offering analysis in detail of the photographs returned including information like the speed of vehicles operating in the port, as well as ship identification and cargo information. This is just one measure of responsiveness — the overall BlackSky constellation of six imaging satellites can be tasked globally for quick turnaround. But it’s a noteworthy development because it shows just how quickly modern small satellites can be brought online, delivering useful information much, much faster than was previously possible. This illustrates how the major stopgap for responsive on-demand imaging and monitoring from new spacecraft is actually now launch availability. New private launch companies are often asked about whether there’s even a need for more launch services out there, now that SpaceX and Rocket Lab have been providing reliable service for smaller space companies for a number of years. But this shows how flexible, go-anywhere launch vehicles with even smaller payload capacity could be extremely valuable to a range of customers across commercial industry and government.

Electron can now fly as much as 300 kg (660 lbs) to low Earth orbit (or around 440 lbs to a higher, sun synchronous orbit), and that’s mostly due to battery technology advances, according to Rocket Lab. Electron is not battery-powered, of course — but the electric pumps that help feed its Rutherford engines are. That’s where they’re getting the boost, along with some other optimizations, increasing the total payload capacity by a full third. That’s a lot of additional capacity in the small satellite launch market, where a CubeSat can weigh as little as 3 lbs or less. Rocket Lab notes that this means customers who are using their Photon spacecraft as a satellite bus (essentially the basic satellite platform upon which a company can build their specific instrumentation needs) will now have nearly 400 lbs available to them for their equipment, which should make possible a whole range of potential new applications. The company announced last week that it was aiming to return to active launch status as early as this month, after an issue caused the early termination and failure of a mission in early July. It said it was able to quickly identify the problem and is already implementing a fix, and now it clearly wants to remind potential customers of its unique offerings and capabilities in the small satellite market.

The car maker said in a notice that it will notify about 2.15 million customers whose personal and vehicle information were left exposed to the internet after a “cloud misconfiguration” was discovered recently in April. Toyota said that the exposed data includes: registered email addresses; vehicle-unique chassis and navigation terminal numbers; the location of vehicles and what time they were there; and videos from the vehicle’s “drive recorder” which records footage from the car. Toyota said the data spilling from its connected cloud was initially exposed in November 2013, but pertains only to vehicles in Japan, according to the company. The company’s connected service provides Toyota customers with information about their vehicle, provides in-car entertainment services and helps to notify authorities in the event of an accident or breakdown. Lexus car owners who signed up to the G-Link service are also affected. Toyota said the data was secured, but has not seen any reports that the data was obtained or maliciously used. It’s not clear if Toyota has the logging in place to detect what, if any, data was exfiltrated from its network. Toyota said in its statement that it would introduce a system to monitor its cloud, suggesting its existing efforts were insufficient. In 2022, Toyota admitted it exposed about 300,000 customer email addresses for close to five years after a subcontractor inadvertently uploaded part of the company’s source code to the internet. That data included a private key that stored customer email addresses. Do you know more about the Toyota security lapse? Do you work at Toyota?

Dawn Aerospace took the wrapper off one today, a suborbital space plane called the Dawn Mk-II Aurora that’s smaller than a compact car and that will be capable of making multiple return trips to suborbital space per day. The Mk-II is, as its name suggests, a second iteration of the concept created by Dawn. The Mk-I was actually built, and flew in May 2018, demonstrating its ability to fire up its rockets during flight after taking off horizontally from a traditional airstrip. One of the Mk-II’s key capabilities is its ability to take off and land at conventional runways, obviating the need for specialized and expensive vertical launch compounds. Dawn Aerospace was founded in Delft, in the Netherlands, with ties to the Technical University of Delft, and also operates out of New Zealand, which has a growing reputation in the New Space industry stemming from being the home of Rocket Lab, one of the most successful new companies operating commercial launch services. The company’s entire mission is built around a sustainable space-based economy, and it also has a thriving business in CubeSat propulsion, building systems that use food-grade propellants for safe fuels that don’t carry as much of an environmental cost. The Mk-II Aurora approaches the goal of sustainable commercial spaceflight in a different way, promising flights to 60 miles and above for payloads of 3U, which is small but perfectly suitable for a range of scientific experiments. It’ll be able to fly and return for multiple trips per day, at a cost of roughly $50,000 per flight, with real-time downlink communications capabilities. Dawn has plans for an Mk-III iteration of its space plane that will be 60 feet long and be able to carry all the way to orbit payloads weighing between 110 and 220 lbs. Combined with its ability to do multiple daily flights and take off and land from conventional runways anywhere in the world, that would be a game-changer for the small satellite launch industry.

Astra has just completed a second static test fire of its Rocket 3.1 orbital launch vehicle, and that means it’s now ready for a trip to Alaska, where it’ll hopefully make its first trip to orbit from a spaceport in Kodiak. Astra originally started out as a company with the specific goal of answering the DARPA launch challenge, which asked companies to create a launch vehicle that could orbit within a few weeks of each other (originally from separate launch sites, but then later only from separate pads at the same spaceport). The challenge expired without Astra claiming the prize, after the 3.0 version of their Rocket failed to reach orbit. Volume up! pic.twitter.com/4lMy8GBKDt — Astra (@Astra) July 16, 2020 The company has developed, tested and flown three successive generations of Rocket, mostly without much in the way of public fanfare or information sharing. The startup builds its small rockets, which measure roughly 40-feet tall, in Alameda, California at their own factory. In an interview with TechCrunch ahead of their DARPA challenge attempt, Astra CEO and founder Chris Kemp explained that their approach is focused on rapid, at-scale manufacturing and potential failure margins that might be higher than the existing launch companies tolerate. A kind of mass-market delivery system approach definitely has advantages, and Astra has focused on a launch system that’s much more portable than others for deployment almost anywhere in the world. The company is also focused on small payloads, which it can deliver responsively, so a loss of such a spacecraft wouldn’t be nearly as expensive as, say, a rocket failing and losing a large geosynchronous GPS satellite. Rocket 3.1 sounds like a relatively minor iteration on Rocket 3.0, versus the large full point updates of prior generations. Astra says it’s currently headed to Kodiak, and that the company is now working to finalize a launch window, with a date to be confirmed early next week for that next big test.

The mission is called the “Astrophysics Stratospheric Telescope for High Spectral Resolution Observations at Submillimeter-wavelengths,” shortened to ASTHROS, since that’s a mouthful. It is currently set to take off from Antarctica in December 2023, and the main payload is an 8.4-foot telescope that will point itself at four primary targets, including two regions in the Milky Way where scientists have observed star formation activity. That telescope, the largest ever to be flown in this way, will be held aloft by a balloon that will measure roughly 400 feet wide, when fully inflated, with scientists on the ground able to precisely direct the orientation of the business end of the observation instrument. Its mission will include between two or three full loops around the South Pole during a period spanning between three and four weeks as it drifts along high-altitude stratospheric winds. After that, the telescope will separate from the balloon and return to Earth slowed by a parachute so that it can potentially be recovered and flown again in the future to perform similar experiments. While floating a balloon up to the edge of Earth’s atmosphere might sound like more of a relaxed affair than launching a satellite using an explosion-propelled rocket, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab engineer Jose Siles said in an agency release that balloon science missions are actually higher-risk than space missions, in part because many elements of them are novel. At the same time, however, they have the potential to provide significant rewards at a reduced cost relative to satellite launches on rockets. The end goal is for ASTHROS to create “the first detailed 3D maps of the density, speed and motion of gas” in these regions around newborn stars, in order to help better understand how they can impede the development of other stars, or encourage the birth of some. This will be helpful in refining existing simulations of the formation and evolution of galaxies, the agency says.

The company will launch its “Rocket 3.1” from Kodiak, Alaska — and while these are technically classified as orbital test flights, the company was quick to caution journalists on a press call on Thursday that it doesn’t necessarily believe each of the three initial launches it has planned will make it all the way to orbit proper. “We don’t intend to get a hole-in-one here,” said CEO Chris Kemp. “It’s a par three course. We intend to really accomplish enough to ensure that we’re able to get to [orbital] flight after three flights, and for us, that means a nominal first-stage burn, and getting that upper stage to separate successfully. After that, pretty much everything that we learn is additional upside, and we’ll be just delighted if that upper stage lights and we’ll be delighted if the upper stage teaches us something so that our next flight can even be more successful.” Astra’s approach to building and launching rockets differs somewhat from its competitors. The startup only incorporated three years ago, and it’s building its rockets in Alameda, California — not far from Oakland. The Rocket 3.1 is a roughly 40-foot launch vehicle that carries a small payload, roughly equivalent to one of the small sats that make up the large constellations currently being launched for operation in low Earth orbit by a number of companies (for reference, SpaceX launches 60 of these on each of its Starlink missions). When I spoke to Kemp ahead of their original attempt to win a DARPA launch challenge (since ended with the prize unclaimed), he stressed that they’re looking to build in volume at low cost, with the expectation of a higher tolerable margin for failure than other new space launch companies like SpaceX and Rocket Lab. “Rather than trying to spend many years doing it the first time, we’re iterating towards orbit,” Kemp said during Thursday’s conference about their debut attempt next week. This is a do-over after the original planned attempt, which suffered an anomaly that led to a total loss of the vehicle . That was a Rocket 3.0 model, and the company has upgraded the design and worked out a number of issues, including the one that led to that failure, with the ensuing time. The gap between now and that attempt at the end of March includes delays resulting from COVID-19, though Astra was eventually declared one of very few companies still allowed to maintain a staffed office because it’s considered important to national security. These three initial test flights won’t carry any payload, in part because Astra fully expects to lose at least the first vehicle. But Astra’s model actually allows for some operational failures in exchange for economics that allow much less expensive individual launch costs than are currently possible with either SpaceX or Rocket Lab’s rideshare missions as options for small satellite operators. The first Astra test launch is currently targeting sometime between a window that spans August 2 to August 7, between the hours of 7 PM and 9 PM PDT (6 and 8 PM local time in Kodiak). So far, weather isn’t looking great for Sunday, but the company notes the weather shifts quickly and plans to keep a close watch and adapt accordingly.

Now the Space Force has revealed a new, sharper graphic that is the force’s actual logo — and a motto to go with it: “Semper Supra,” or “always above.” To be clear, the image revealed in January, which everyone thought looked quite a bit like Starfleet’s, is the seal for the Space Force branch of the military. The new, simpler one is the logo for the organization as a whole, which is the one we’ll see communications and recruiting branded with. You can tell them apart because the new one looks like the Pontiac logo . Experts say Space Force is a vital, massive shift for US military In a series of tweets , the Space Force explained the various elements of the logo. It’s not exactly esoteric stuff, but it’s nice to know the chrome is there for a reason and not just because it looks cool. The silver border of the skyward-pointing delta shape, they said, “signifies defense and protection from all adversaries and threats emanating from the space domain.” The middle part is black because it “embodies the vast darkness of deep space. Some feel fear and dread but we prefer to be inspired and stand up to the challenge.” And in the very center is a star. It’s Polaris, the north star, which “guides. That’s why it is in the center of our logo.” The “beveled elements,” being quadpartite, symbolize the four armed forces supporting the branch: Air Force, Army, Navy and Marines. They’re spiky because it makes them look a bit like rockets shooting into space. As for the motto: “Semper Supra,” meaning “always above,” could be construed as either reassuring or menacing, depending on which end of the Space Force you’ve got pointing at you. It represents “establishing, maintaining, and preserving” the U.S. presence in space, and of course to a soldier on the ground, it’s nice to think that they have operational support from the always-above Space Force. For others, it brings to mind spy satellites or orbital lasers. Expect to see this logo a lot over the next few years as this new branch matures and recruits. More importantly, the Space Force has horses: You have heard of a MW🐕  but what about a MW🐎? Protecting our access to space involves many unique aspects, including welcoming @30thSpaceWing 's newest Military Working Horse to their Conservation Military Working Horse program. Ghost is a 5 year old @BLMNational Mustang. pic.twitter.com/r1dAd0plsc — United States Space Force (@SpaceForceDoD) July 23, 2020 Congratulations to the Space Force on their new logo, and to Ghost for being beautiful and strong.

That’s the backbone of Amazon’s Project Kuiper, an initiative to create a satellite-based broadband internet service designed to provide high-speed, low-latency connections to U.S.-based households that currently don’t have great access to a high-speed connection. Alongside the key regulatory approval, Amazon also announced that it would be committing over $10 billion in Kuiper, money that it says will generate U.S. jobs and involve not only building and testing satellites for the constellation, but also building out key ground network infrastructure that’s required in order to actually make the connectivity available to consumers. Amazon’s Kuiper includes plans to provide backhaul service to carriers in addition to direct consumer service. Essentially, that means it’ll offer a way for carriers to offer high-speed LTE and 5G wireless connections to their customers in more areas where they don’t currently have the ground station infrastructure to do so. Amazon says this will be on offer “in the United States and around the world,” so it sounds like the plan is to first address the U.S. market and then expand the Kuiper network globally from there. Amazon lags behind SpaceX in terms of deployment, since the latter company is actually launching satellites for its Starlink network, and looks ready to enter a beta testing program for the service this summer. The Jeff Bezos-led e-commerce giant has opened a brand new R&D facility in Redmond, Washington dedicated entirely to Kuiper development, however, and partner Blue Origin, Bezos’ space launch company, has been securing significant industry partnerships and could be ready to provide launch services for Kuiper satellites relatively soon. It’s also unlikely that this emerging market for low Earth orbit satellites will have only one winner; provided these networks can actually live up to their promises in terms of latency, speed and quality connection, there will likely be room for multiple providers to compete on a global scale. Amazon’s $10 billion investment is also another good reason to bet it’ll be able to make this a reality — few others out there have as reliable a funding pipeline for the massive upfront infrastructure costs that come with launching a large satellite constellation.

NASA astronauts are already on board Crew Dragon making their way back to Earth during a multi-hour descent, and later on Sunday will be splashing down in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida. Behnken and Hurley undocked from the International Space Station on Saturday, August 1 at just after 7:30 PM EDT, with the Crew Dragon capsule handling all of the maneuvers since in a fully automated fashion, just like it’s designed to do. SpaceX built Crew Dragon to be fully automated both during takeoff and the return to Earth and landing portion of any trip to the ISS, and in fact have previously flown a successful uncrewed version of the mission that’s happening now with astronauts on board. To conclude Demo-2, Behnken and Hurley are currently scheduled to splash down in the Gulf of Mexico at 2:48 PM EDT (11:48 AM PDT), where they’ll be met and recovered by a SpaceX crew. This will be a historic first for a commercial spacecraft, capping a mission of historic first for private human spaceflight that began with the successful launch of Crew Dragon ‘Endeavour’ on May 30. Once Dragon enters the atmosphere, it’ll deploy its parachutes, which will slow it until it’s traveling at a speed of just around 15 mph before it splashes down. The reason it requires such a long trip from time of departure to when it lands in the ocean is that it needs to slow down from a starting speed of around 17,500 mph when it departs the ISS. NASA and SpaceX will have live coverage on the stream above, and we’ll provide any updates about key developments in the mission as they happen.

The launch vehicle experienced a failure during the second-stage burn post-launch after a lift-off from the Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 on Mahia Peninsula in New Zealand. The mission appeared to be progressing as intended, but the launch vehicle appeared to experience unexpected stress during the “Max Q” phase of launch, or the period during which the Electron rocket experiences the most significant atmospheric pressure prior to entering space. Launch video cut off around six minutes after liftoff during the live stream, and the rocket was subsequently shown to be falling from its current altitude before the web stream was cut short. Rocket Lab then revealed via Twitter that the Electron vehicle was lost during the second-stage burn, and committed to sharing more information when it becomes available. This is an unexpected development for Rocket Lab, which has flown 11 uneventful consecutive Electron missions since the beginning of its program. Rocket Lab CEO and founder Peter Beck posted an apology to Twitter , noting that all satellites were lost, and that he’s “incredibly sorry” to all customer who suffered loss of payload today. That includes Canon, which was flying a new Earth-imaging satellite with demonstration imaging tech on board, as well as Planet, which had five satellites for its newest and most advanced Earth-imaging constellation on the vehicle.

The Space Force took over the U.S. in-space GPS assets from the Air Force when it became its own dedicated wing of the U.S. armed forces. The launch employed a Falcon 9 rocket, the first stage of which was new and fresh from SpaceX’s factory floor. This launch did include a recovery attempt of the Falcon 9 booster, however, unlike the first GPS III launch that SpaceX launched in December 2018. SpaceX says that it was able to work with its customer to ensure that it could complete its mission as planned, while retaining enough reserve fuel for a recovery attempt — something that didn’t happen with the first launch. That’s good news for SpaceX, as it means it won’t be losing that booster this time around, with a confirmed successful controlled burn and landing on its floating drone landing ship at sea. That booster can now be refurbished and used again for future Falcon 9 missions. The GPS spacecraft launched on this flight includes greater capabilities, better security and the potential to impact up to 4 billion users worldwide, the Space Force notes. It’ll enter a geosynchronous orbit and work with other existing GPS III satellites on orbit, as well as other existing earlier-generation GPS satellites operated by the U.S. SpaceX also says that its Ms. Tree and Ms. Chief ships will attempt fairing recovery at sea, not via catch but by fishing them out of the water. The fairing protects the satellite during the launch and on its trip to space, and then falls back to Earth — where SpaceX generally tries to recover the pieces for later refurbishment and re-use. The deployment of the satellite will occur around an hour and a half after launch, so while the launch has been successful, the full mission status will only be determined then. We’ll update this post with the results of that maneuver. Topics Editor at Large LIMITED TIME: Save $300+ on your ticket, plus an additional 50% on a second for a full immersive day of AI!

The arrangement will see Virgin Galactic purchase seats on spacecraft bound for the orbiting International Space Station, as well as provide training and supplies and resources for those individuals. Virgin Galactic is in the process of developing its own sub-orbital space tourism program using its own spacecraft that will launch from a carrier airplane, but this deal would involve use of other spacecraft that have the capacity to reach orbit and the ISS — which Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo can’t do. The most likely candidate for where Virgin will be procuring those seats right now is SpaceX, although Virgin’s press release announcing the news does not mention the Elon Musk-led company. SpaceX’s Crew Dragon, which is currently docked at the ISS after its first-ever successful astronaut-carrying launch last month, is likely to become the first human-rated private spacecraft certified by NASA upon its return to Earth, likely happening sometime around August. Crew Dragon can hold as many as seven people per launch, and NASA is only ever going to use a maximum of four seats, the agency has said, with hopes that private individuals, including researchers and tourists, will buy up remaining tickets to help offset the costs of launch. Virgin Galactic will essentially be operating a launch services business for private astronauts, similar to the one set up by Space Adventures, which has an agreement in place with SpaceX , and which previously brokered trips to the ISS for private astronauts, including Anousheh Ansari aboard Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft. Again, SpaceX hasn’t been mentioned here specifically, and Virgin Galactic will likely also be seeking access to Boeing’s Starliner crew spacecraft once it’s operational and certified to transport humans to the ISS, too. It is interesting to note that SpaceX’s arrangement with Space Adventures thus far focuses only on orbital fly-and-return missions for Crew Dragon, and not on any flights that would involve actually docking at the ISS. Also worth noting is that Virgin Galactic will be procuring and training private astronauts, including individual citizens, as well as government-sponsored scientific research missions. So publicly funded scientists that aren’t specifically NASA astronauts will likely also go through Virgin. The private spaceflight company says it will use its Spaceport America facility in New Mexico for “some elements of the training program.” Virgin Galactic’s move from being a private spaceflight launch provider to a services and procurement company working between NASA and private spaceflight launch companies is definitely a large and significant shift in its business. It should definitely decrease the company’s time to revenue as it continues to develop and test its own human launch capabilities, a process which obviously carries a lot more overhead than working with existing, already certified launch providers as an intermediary provider.

To accomplish those, and other launches like them, the company is also setting up a new launch site at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. “It’s obviously pretty huge news for us,” Relativity co-founder and CEO Tim Ellis told TechCrunch. “Not only do we have a second launch site, but we have an anchor customer. We’ve actually pre-sold more launches than any other company in the industry since SpaceX.” Iridium has put 66 satellites in orbit over the last few years on SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets, but there are several in storage as spares should it become necessary to replace one. Replacement launches will occur as needed starting no earlier than 2023, giving both companies plenty of wiggle room. “Relativity is one of the only companies that can launch these at all — they’re north of 800 kilograms,” Ellis noted. That puts smaller vehicles like Rocket Lab’s Electron and aspirants like Virgin Orbit out of the running, pitting Relativity’s Terran I against Arianespace’s Vega and ISRO’s PSLV. Relativity Space expands its rocket-printing operations into an enormous new Long Beach HQ Not only would a Terran I be much less expensive than those, but “we’re fully U.S. funded, staffed, operated, and launched,” Ellis said. That makes it very attractive to more than a few segments of the space community. The Iridium launches would need to enter a polar orbit, which isn’t possible with the setup Relativity has at its launch facility in Cape Canaveral. So the company has been working with Vandenberg Air Force Base, near Los Angeles, to establish a spot where polar and sun-synchronous orbits are possible. The company and the Air Force have reached what’s known as “right of entry,” a term specific to arrangements like this that basically means Relativity can do testing on site while fulfilling the other prerequisites to using the area in a more permanent fashion. Ellis noted with satisfaction that the new spot at Vandenberg has a special quality: “It’s the southernmost site, and since we fly south, we don’t overfly any other major launch sites. So from a scheduling conflict perspective, we expect the fewest conflicts of any site out there.” That means more flexibility and possibly an increased launch cadence down the road. That’s all presuming everything goes as planned as far as actually getting Terran I into space, though the company’s momentum is substantial. “We’re fully on track for first launch in 2021 in Cape Canaveral. We’ve already passed the environmental assessment, and we’re close to getting a full site license,” Ellis said. Testing has restarted at NASA’s Stennis Space Center, and the company is planning a full-scale engine test in the fall. Relativity also recently moved to a new, enormous headquarters in Long Beach, where its unique 3D printing process for rocket parts will take in raw materials and output nearly complete launch vehicles at industry-leading rates. The pandemic put some things on hold, but, Ellis said, actually accelerated their hiring. Relativity recently added to its roster Zac Dunn, who contributed hugely to SpaceX’s success and also worked at Vandenberg; no doubt his network has been put to good use. The company also recently hired its first CFO, Muhammad Shahzad, formerly of the Honest Company and Goldman Sachs. Perhaps he’ll know what to do with the hundreds of millions of dollars the company has. Topics Writer & Photographer Devin Coldewey is a Seattle-based writer and photographer.

The group, which includes funding from India’s Bharti Global — part of business magnate Sunil Mittal’s Bharti Enterprises — plan to pursue OneWeb’s plans of building out a broadband internet satellite network, while the U.K. would also like to potentially use the constellation for Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) services in order to replace the EU’s sat-nav resource, which the U.K. lost access to in January as a result of Brexit. The deal involves both Bharti Global and the U.K. government putting up around $500 million each, respectively, with the U.K. taking a 20% equity stake in OneWeb, and Bharti supplying the business management and commercial operations for the satellite firm. OneWeb, which has launched a total of 74 of its planned 650-satellite constellation to date, suffered layoffs and the subsequent bankruptcy filing after an attempt to raise additional funding to support continued launches and operations fell through. That was reportedly due in large part to majority private investor SoftBank backing out of commitments to invest additional funds. The BBC reports that while OneWeb plans to essentially scale up its existing operations, including reversing layoffs, should the deal pass regulatory scrutiny, there’s a possibility that down the road it could relocate some of its existing manufacturing capacity to the U.K. Currently, OneWeb does its spacecraft manufacturing out of Florida in a partnership with Airbus. OneWeb is a London-based company already, and its constellation can provide access to low latency, high-speed broadband via low Earth orbit small satellites, which could potentially be a great resource for connecting U.K. citizens to affordable, quality connections. The PNT navigation services extension would be an extension of OneWeb’s existing mission, but theoretically, it’s a relatively inexpensive way to leverage planned in-space assets to serve a second purpose. Also, while the U.K. currently lacks its own native launch capabilities, the country is working toward developing a number of spaceports for both vertical and horizontal take-off — which could enable companies like Virgin Orbit, and other newcomers like Skyrora, to establish small-sat launch capabilities from U.K. soil, which would make maintaining and extending in-space assets like OneWeb’s constellation much more accessible as a domestic resource.

AImotive is teaming up with C3S, a supplier of satellite and space-based technologies, to develop a hardware platform for performing AI operations onboard satellites. AImotive’s aiWare neural network accelerator will be optimized by C3S for use on satellites, which have a set of operating conditions that in many ways resembles those onboard cars on the road — but with more stringent requirements in terms of power management and environmental operating hazards. The goal of the team-up is to have AImotive’s technology working on satellites that are actually operational on orbit by the second half of next year. The projected applications of onboard neural network acceleration extend to a number of different functions according to the companies, including telecommunications, Earth imaging and observation, autonomously docking satellites with other spacecraft, deep space mining and more. While it’s true that most satellites operate essentially in an automated fashion already — meaning they’re not generally manually flown at every given moment — true neural network-based onboard AI smarts would provide them with much more autonomy when it comes to performing tasks, like imaging a specific area or looking for specific markers in ground or space-based targets. Also, AImotive and C3S believe that local processing of data has the potential to be a significant game-changer when it comes to the satellite business. Currently, most of the processing of data collected by satellites is done after the raw information is transmitted to ground stations. That can actually result in a lot of lag time between data collection and delivery of processed data to customers, particularly when the satellite operator or another go-between is acting as the processor on behalf of the client rather than just delivering raw info (and doing this analysis is also a more lucrative proposition for the data provider, of course). AImotive’s tech could mean that processing happens locally on the satellite, where the information is captured. There’s been a big shift toward this kind of “computing at the edge” in the ground-based IoT world, and it only makes sense to replicate that in space, for many of the same reasons — including that it reduces time to delivery, meaning more responsive service for paying customers.

U.S. defense agencies are seeking this specifically to help them send up small satellites in greater numbers, with greater frequency, in order to help provide redundancy and address specific needs as they arise. The iRocket Shockwave launch vehicles are intended to carry a payload with a maximum size of around 1,500 kg (around 3,300 lbs.) and are set to take off from sites including Spaceport Oklahoma and potentially Launch Complex 48 at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral. Flexibility in terms of launch sites, including inland in the continental U.S., is another way they can support for flexibility and responsive operations for the Department of Defense and others. iRocket plans to fly its first launch in just under three years’ time, with a plan to begin offering on-orbit satellite servicing as one of its products by 2025. It has a long way to go before that, but there’s definitely plenty of institutional interest in this from deep-pocketed government and defense customers.

On Wednesday, it’s set to follow that up with a less significant Falcon 9 rocket launch, but one that’s still vital to the company’s future. This mission is the latest of SpaceX’s Starlink launches, which the company is using to put up a vast network of small satellites to provide low-cost, high-bandwidth internet access to customers globally. SpaceX’s Starlink mission today has a launch window of 9:25 PM EDT (6:25 PM PDT) and includes a payload of 60 more satellites for the constellation, which already has 420 operating in low Earth orbit. The goal is ultimately to launch as many as 40,000 of these small satellites in order to blanket the globe with connectivity that’s broadly available, and that provides rock-solid network consistency by handing off connections among the satellites as they make their way around the Earth. This launch was originally scheduled to fly the week prior to SpaceX’s Demo-2 crewed mission, which carried NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station on Saturday and Sunday, but was bumped due to a scheduling conflict with a ULA launch, and then further postponed until after the astronaut flight. It’s still already the fifth batch of 60 Starlink satellites that SpaceX has flown in 2020. In total, SpaceX is hoping for up to two-dozen Starlink launches in total before year’s end, which will help it meet its goal of launching an initial beta service in Canada and the U.S. later this year, with a more global rollout following in 2021 or 2022. This launch will take off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, and will use a Falcon 9 first stage that flew on four previous missions. SpaceX will attempt to recover the booster again through a controlled landing, and will also try to catch the fairing halves used to protect the satellite cargo using its “Ms. Tree” and “Ms. Chief” ships. One key novel element for this flight is the test of a new technology SpaceX is hoping will help mitigate the impact of the Starlink constellation on night sky observation from Earth. Scientists have complained that Starlink is bright enough to interfere with sensitive optical instrumentation used to gather data from deep space bodies and phenomena. To address that, SpaceX has designed a deployable “visor” system that extends from Starlink satellites post-launch and attempts to block sunlight reflecting off their communications arrays. SpaceX has equipped one of the 60 satellites on this launch with that system, as a way of testing its efficacy before making it a standard part of the Starlink satellite build going forward. Depending on results, it could become a permanent fixture on all of SpaceX’s Starlink spacecraft for future missions. Should today’s launch be delayed (weather is currently looking around 60% favorable for the mission), there’s a backup opportunity tomorrow, June 4 at 9:03 PM EDT (6:03 PM PDT).

That brings the total number of operational Starlink broadband internet satellites on orbit to 538. SpaceX also split the payload for this Starlink mission for the first time, giving up two of its usual Starlink payload complement in order to also carry three Planet Skysat spacecraft on behalf of that client. SpaceX’s latest Starlink launch was significant not only because it brings the company closer to its goal of actually operating a consumer-facing broadband internet service, which it hopes to begin doing for a limited pool of customers in the U.S. and Canada by later this year, but also because these Starlink satellites carried new modifications designed to make them more astronomer-friendly. Starlink, because of its size and the relatively low-altitude orbit that they traverse, has been criticized by nighttime scientific observers because they present a potentially bright distraction as they pass overhead. SpaceX launched one Starlink satellite equipped with a new deployable sun visor it created that can block reflections of sunlight off their antenna surfaces, and on this launch, each of the 58 satellites was outfitted with this new mitigating technology. Hopefully, that means that Starlink can now exist more harmoniously with scientists who rely on Earth-based observation of the stars and night sky, but the ultimate proof will be in what difference these solar visors make when deployed in volume among the Starlink constellation. This mission was also the first conducted under SpaceX’s formalized SmallSat Rideshare Program , which offers small satellite operators a chance to book a ride aboard an upcoming SpaceX launch in a relatively flexible, “on-demand” manner using a web portal SpaceX created for the purpose. SpaceX’s efforts to offer more value to the rideshare business reflects a recognition that other launch providers like Rocket Lab, which tailor specifically to that market segment, are significant potential competition to its overall bottom line. The launch today, which occurred at 5:21 AM EDT (2:21 AM PDT), also included a recovery landing of the Falcon 9 first-stage booster used to propel the payload to space. This booster also previously flew on two of SpaceX’s Dragon cargo resupply missions to the International Space Station.

Here’s your Daily Crunch for June 1, 2020. 1. SpaceX’s first crewed spacecraft successfully docks with the International Space Station SpaceX’s Crew Dragon “Endeavor” successfully docked with the International Space Station as planned on Sunday morning, marking another key milestone during this historic Commercial Crew demonstration mission it’s conducting with NASA. On-board were NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken, the first people ever to make the trip to orbit aboard a spacecraft built by a private company. Crossing this milestone means that essentially the first half of the mission has been completed successfully. So far, SpaceX has demonstrated that the launch process works as designed, as does manual control (the astronauts took over and ran two tests of that system) and automated docking. 2. Tech companies respond to George Floyd’s death, ensuing protests and systemic racism Tech companies and CEOs have begun to weigh in on what amounts to a rather delicate topic for corporations not accustomed to rocking the boat on these manner of social issues. For example, Apple’s Tim Cook wrote, “This is a moment when many people may want nothing more than a return to normalcy, or to a status quo that is only comfortable if we avert our gaze from injustice. As difficult as it may be to admit, that desire is itself a sign of privilege.” 3. Zynga acquires Turkey’s Peak Games for $1.8B, after buying its card games studio for $100M in 2017 By making this deal, Zynga is picking up two very popular titles/franchises that it doesn’t have do develop from scratch — Peak Games’ Toon Blast and Toy Blast together total more than 12 million DAUs. 4. Global smartphone sales plummeted 20% in Q1 thanks to COVID-19 Gartner’s latest report puts the global market at a 20.2% slide versus the same time last year, thanks in large part to fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Every single one of the global top-five manufacturers saw large declines for the quarter, save for Xiaomi, which saw a slight uptick of 1.4%. 5. 6 VCs share their bets on the future of work As loneliness mounts with shelter-in-place orders implemented in various forms across the world, investors are looking for products and services that foster true connection among a distributed workforce, as well as a distributed society.

The company first launched a vehicle in 2017, but the launch didn’t go exactly as planned and failed to reach space. In 2019, its MOMO-3 sounding rocket did break the Karman line, though just barely. And, unfortunately, its MOMO-5 sounding rocket launched today did not make space as planned, instead apparently suffering some kind of malfunction and loss of control around the time it reached max Q, or the point of maximum aerodynamic pressure prior to exiting Earth’s atmosphere. MOMO-5 took off at 8:15 PM UTC (4:15 PM EDT), and liftoff seemed to go smoothly. This demonstration launch was meant to build on IST’s existing development program and put it closer to establishing a new, affordable rocket option for redelivering small payloads to orbit using a small, affordable rocket that the company describes as a “family sedan for the stars.” IST’s approach is interesting in that it doesn’t claim to be cutting-edge; instead, the company says that it focuses on leveraging “legacy methods” of rocketry, along with advances including additive manufacturing and more modern materials to reduce costs as much as possible to lower the bar in terms of affordability to serve a wide range of customers. To some extent, that’s similar to the approach taken by SpaceX and Rocket Lab, but IST’s approach is even less focused on modernization, and more intent on efficiencies, than some of its operational competitors, which could theoretically give it a cost advantage once it starts serving companies with regular commercial launches. MOMO-5 launched from Hokkaido, Japan, in a mission rescheduled from the end of 2019 and earlier this year due to a number of delays, including COVID-19 and the May holidays observed in the country. MOMO-5 measures a little over 30-feet tall, and weighs around 2,200 lbs, making it smaller than Rocket Lab’s Electron. IST says that MOMO-5 terminated its flight earlier than planned due to a manual “emergency stop” order delivered from the command center, and subsequently fell safely to the surface of the sea. More details about the cause of the early termination will be released later.

SpaceX will use these larger rockets to get its forthcoming large payload rockets to the moon, to Mars — and also for point-to-point travel right here on Earth, according to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. SpaceX is building floating, superheavy-class spaceports for Mars, moon & hypersonic travel around Earth https://t.co/zLJjz43hKw — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 16, 2020 Musk said on Twitter that this was the purpose behind the new job posting, which was originally spotted by Dan Paasch. SpaceX has previously shown concepts of its forthcoming Super Heavy rocket booster, paired with its Starship spacecraft, launching for hypersonic Earth travel — which would reduce the trip time for long-haul flights to merely a couple of hours. Those concepts have thus far consisted only of renders, however, and we didn’t know what the plan was in terms of how and from where those spacecraft would launch until today. Starship and Super Heavy are primarily being developed to help SpaceX and Musk realize their goal of delivering humans to Mars, in order to colonize that and other interstellar destinations, including the moon to “make humans an interstellar species.” But while those goals may seem out of reach to most people, the company’s aims of using the same fully reusable spacecraft to greatly decrease the cost of point-to-point supersonic travel here on Earth are likely to be much more relevant. Point-to-point space-based transportation is not a new concept, and others beyond SpaceX are working on developing ways to make this happen. The idea is that by traveling at the edge of, or beyond Earth’s atmosphere, you can greatly reduce the fuel cost and duration of flight — traveling the distance between New York and Paris, for instance, in under an hour. In fact, SpaceX claimed during a presentation in 2017 that point-to-point transportation with its Starship could reach any city on Earth from any other city in less than an hour. SpaceX has been developing Starship in Texas, near Brownsville where this new job posting is seeking Offshore Operations Engineers. The company has been expanding its testing and development site in the area, and has also sought to increase the resources dedicated to its operations in the state. Musk didn’t share much more about the plans, but did say in response to another tweet that claimed this amounted to “Referb[ushing] oil platforms with a hyperloop to transport from land” was “pretty much” part of the plan, so that could be involved in shuttling passengers back and forth to and from their departure and destination spaceports.

https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/startup-space-perspective-plans-space-tourist-cruises-using-stratospheric-balloons-with-test-flight-set-for-2021/,"Startup Space Perspective plans space tourist ‘cruises’ using stratospheric balloons, with test flight set for 2021",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us There’s a new company that wants to get into the commercial space tourism business — with a unique spin that involves non-traditional launch vehicles. Space Perspective, a new startup founded by Jane Poynter and Taber MacCallum, intends to fly a pressurized capsule to the upper edge of Earth’s atmosphere using a high-altitude balloon, which can hold up to eight passengers for a six-hour trip at an anticipated price of around $125,000 per person. The plan, according to the company, is to use its so-called “Spaceship Neptune” capsules to host both tourists and research payloads, with a cruising height of around 100,000 feet. It’s actually technically not space, but the company promises fantastic views that will include sights like the actual curvature of the Earth. The six-hour trip will include a two-hour ascent, a two-hour flight at the top of the atmosphere and a two-hour descent back to Earth, according to Space Perspective. The company intends to launch its balloons and capsule from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and when it returns to Earth, it’ll splash down in the Atlantic Ocean, where a ship will retrieve the passengers and the capsule. The FAA will regulate all of Space Perspective’s human flights, and it’s working with the U.S. regulatory agency in advance of its planned crewed missions, which are likely still a few years away, at least. If any of this sounds familiar, it might be because Space Perspective’s founders created a company with some very similar goals earlier in their careers: Poynter and MacCallum previously co-founded World View, a stratospheric balloon company whose primary mission is to fly payloads, including communications and Earth observation hardware, but which also had as one of its stated goals a mission to fly people using balloon-lofted capsules. World View still operates, though Poynter was replaced as its CEO by Ryan Hartman in February of last year. World View’s primary HQ is in Arizona, and it operates a manufacturing and launch facility there, from which it regularly flies its balloons as it continues to develop and deploy its technology. Space Perspective is a completely separate company, a company representative tells me. The company plans to launch from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, as mentioned, and will also launch in the future from Florida’s Cecil Spaceport, as well as private launch sites in Alaska, Hawaii and internationally, the company says. The startup plans to begin test launching its Neptune capsule as early as next year, though without any people on board. Instead, it’ll carry experimental payloads, which is again a secondary goal of the technology that Space Perspective intends to put in market. This is an interesting entrance in the “not-quite-space” tourism industry, with some differentiators that could make it a compelling alternative to offerings from Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, though not on par with what SpaceX intends to do with its private Crew Dragon commercial flights. Poynter and MacCallum appear to have started this as a separate venture from World View in order to allow that company to focus on its more practical industry and commercial payload missions, allowing Space Perspective to better express their specific goal of human high-altitude transportation.

Update 2 : And it’s up! Rocket Lab’s delayed 12th launch is scheduled to take place tonight late night Pacific time, mid-afternoon on the 11th at the company’s New Zealand launch facility. The Electron rocket will be taking payloads to orbit from NASA, the National Reconnaissance Office and the University of New South Wales. “Don’t Stop Me Now,” named after the favorite Queen song of board member Scott Smith, who passed away in February, was originally scheduled for takeoff in late March. The delay is due to, of course, the pandemic. But things have loosened up enough that the crew can do the necessary work to safely prepare for launch. Rocket Lab postpones next mission due to coronavirus pandemic The window for launch extends from 9:43 to 11:32 tonight Pacific time, weather and other factors permitting. Like all of Rocket Lab’s launches, it will be live-streamed starting about 15 minutes before T-0. The payload contains a variety of projects, some more public than others. NASA’s contribution is a Cubesat from Boston University called ANDESITE, which will “use a wireless network of lightweight minisatellites to measure the strength and direction of electrical currents flowing in and out of Earth’s magnetic field, the impact of which can affect radio communications and electrical systems on Earth.” UNSW has a satellite called the M2 Pathfinder, a research platform for some space-based radio communications tech. The NRO, as expected of a secretive three-letter agency, gives no details of what it’s sending up. Don’t even ask. It is, however, openly very excited about being able to send up its secretive payloads more frequently via commercial launch providers. You can watch the launch take place live tonight (or tomorrow if you’re on the East coast or pretty much anywhere else) at Rocket Lab’s live-stream page right here .

https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/spacedrop/,The new documentary ‘Spacedrop’ takes viewers inside a simulated space quarantine,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us “The first Asian Jew in fake space” — that’s how Josh Burstein introduced himself to me when we hopped on the phone earlier this week. The fake space in question is the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS), where NASA has been periodically isolating teams of astronauts to study how they respond to the stresses of space exploration — and where Burstein was stationed last year . Now he’s releasing a 37-minute documentary special about that experience, called “Spacedrop.” The special lives up to its tagline: “How to space quarantine.” For two weeks, Burstein and an international team of scientists led by Michaela Musilova treated a habitat on the slopes of Mauna Loa as if it was a real habitat on the Moon or Mars — spending most of their time inside, and only leaving to explore the landscape beyond its walls after donning breathing equipment that approximates a real spacesuit. And yes, the film does spend a few minutes on the parallels between a simulated space quarantine and our current coronavirus-imposed, stay-at-home world. Burstein acknowledged that the situations are very different — for one thing, HI-SEAS was a much briefer quarantine. And while he spent time in both the special and our interview talking about the amazing feeling of stepping outside after quarantine ended and “hearing the spokes of a bicycle, seeing the color green, everything came back in Technicolor,” it seems unlikely that the rest of us will get an equally quick and satisfying return to normalcy. “We’re not going to burst out of quarantine running,” he said. “It’s going to be more of a slow burn.” Still, he believes there are lessons people can learn from his experience, like the importance of “successfully managing expectations.” And he hopes “Spacedrop” helps to illustrate the importance of space exploration, even at a time of global crisis, and as we head into what’s likely to be a global recession. After all, he noted that space education and research isn’t just about “running into Boba Fett,” but also has real benefits for science and technology here on Earth. And one of the big themes of the documentary is international cooperation. “The one thing that Democrats and Republicans agree on is that space is cool,” Burstein said, adding that the International Space Station is the one place “where Americans and Russians are in constant collaboration and have a strong relationship.” And even though it’s a documentary (a word that Burstein shied away from in our interview), it’s very far from being self-serious or dull. Instead, there are plenty of jokes about cabin fever, body odor and the disappointing state of space cuisine. After all, Burstein — a non-scientist, non-astronaut, whose résumé includes stints with the Obama campaign and as Charlie Sheen’s social media manager — is admirably realistic about his own role on the mission. He cheerfully described himself as a “redshirt,” and the special makes sure to point out that his first job in a spacesuit involves taking out the trash. How did Burstein get invited to participate? He told me he “cold-called NASA” and convinced them to let him join in and film the experience. After all, communication and education are an important part of space exploration. As for whether he’d consider making a trip to the real Moon or Mars, he said he’s willing — but maybe not on those first missions: “I would totally go on a leisure trip to the Moon and eat at the Sbarro in the moonbase food court.” “Spacedrop” is coming to Amazon Prime Video soon, and in the meantime is live on Vimeo .

https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/23/heres-what-virgin-orbit-hopes-to-achieve-with-their-first-full-orbital-test-launch-on-sunday/,Here’s what Virgin Orbit hopes to achieve with their first full orbital test launch on Sunday,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Virgin Orbit held a press briefing on Saturday hosted by CEO Dan Hart and VP of Special Projects Will Pomerantz. The company aims to fly its first ever orbital test launch on Sunday, at roughly 9:30 AM PT (12:30 PM ET), though there’s flexibility for that to move depending on preparations and weather. If it succeeds with this test, it’ll join an elite club of private spaceflight companies that have actually made it to orbit – but that’s not the only measure of success for Virgin for tomorrow’s test run. Hart and Pomerantz took journalists through the flight plan and different scenarios of what could happen, tempering expectations by reminding those on the call that “about half” of a company’s first full flights fail. While Pomerantz pointed out the failure rate, he was also quick to note that he’s extremely proud of the work the Virgin Orbit team has done to date, and has confidence in their skill sand abilities. “You essentially get to a point where you have looked under every rock and verify that there’s nothing more for you to do to verify that the system is ready,” Pomerantz said. “That’s what we have done. We’ve ygone through an enormous amount of tests, we’ve essentially done everything that we can think of that we should do including fill the rocket up with cryogenics and fuel and pressure and and fly it out to the drop.” The point Pomerantz makes is one that comes up often in rocket and spaceflight vehicle development – you can test systems individually, run simulations, and prepare as much as you possibly can, but nothing quite compares to actually flying the full system as it’s intended to fly under real-world conditions. Virgin Orbit expects to begin fueling the rocket very early on Sunday morning, and as mentioned it’s targeting 9:30 AM PT (12:30 PM ET) for the actual launch, though it has a couple of hours of flexibility after that point in case things need to move. From there, the company’s Cosmic Girl launcher, which is modified Boeing 747 aircraft that carries its LauncherOne rocket, will fly for about 45 minutes to an hour to reach the drop point at around 35,000 feet. That’s when the rocket will separate, and ignite its own engine and continue – hopefully all the way to space, though Virgin will be monitoring its performance and conditions and could stop short of actual orbit depending on how the launch is proceeding. From the drop point, Cosmic Girl will return to its runway at the Mojave Air and Spaceport in California, where it should land roughly 30 minutes after releasing LauncherOne. The whole point of the launch is to gather more data for ensuring that each part of the process works as designed once the launch vehicles graduate to operational status, and Hart explained. “The purpose of this flight is to incrementally test the rocket and the airplane and the system as we pass through the operation,” Hart said. We will be loading and learning as we go through the day. So we’ll be getting data on our load sequence, our captured carry flight out, and the full flight of the rocket after it drops through first stage flight, separation, second stage flight, and so forth and so on. And we have telemetry stations around the world to capture the data as it comes down. The data, for tomorrow, is the product of that flight.” The results of this flight will inform Virgin Orbit’s go-forward strategy, which includes hopefully flying one to two more times this year, which Pomerantz pointed out is actually fairly aggressive in terms of goals relative to other new spacecraft developed in past. Then they’ll also look to fly around twice as many times in 2021. Asked about their market fit, Hart pointed out that he doesn’t believe the small satellite industry is still well-served in terms of a range of flexible offerings, noting that ride share missions often leave spacecraft in less than optimal orbits, where they either just operate in a compromised fashion or have to rely on an in-space bus to carry them the rest of the way. Virgin Orbit aims to be affordable enough that small satellite clients can use it to take them exactly where they need to go. He also added that because of the design of its in-air launcher, it’s flexible in terms of launch sites, which basically means it can take off and fly a mission from wherever a Boeing 747 can operate – which definitely isn’t true of any traditional rocket operator. As Hart also noted, the number of companies that are actually flying to space and delivering payloads on behalf of customers is still tiny – there are a lot of companies working towards that goal, but few who’ve actually succeeded, even in a test mission. Virgin Orbit could join that elite club tomorrow – provided everything goes well.

On board Crew Dragon were NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken, the test pilots selected to be the first-ever humans to fly on board SpaceX’s Crew Dragon, and the first people ever to make the trip to orbit aboard a spacecraft built by a private company. The docking process was handled completely autonomously by Crew Dragon itself, which is designed by SpaceX to operate on autopilot from the moment of launch throughout the course of the entire mission. The spacecraft is able to dock with a newer automated international docking adapter installed on the ISS, unlike the original cargo version of Dragon, which required manual capture by the robotic Canadarm 2 controlled by astronauts on the station. The updated cargo Dragon and Crew Dragon are designed to work with the new automated system. Hurley and Behnken launched at 3:22 PM EDT (12:22 PM PDT) on Saturday , taking off from Cape Canaveral in Florida. It was the second launch attempt for this mission, after weather caused a delay last Wednesday. This mission is NASA and SpaceX’s Commercial Crew Demo-2, which is the second demonstration mission of the full flight and return of the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft, one of two vehicles commissioned by NASA from commercial partners to provide transportation services for astronauts to and from the Space Station. Crossing this milestone means that essentially the first half of the mission has been completed successfully — so far, SpaceX has demonstrated that the launch process works as designed, as does manual control (the astronauts took over and ran two tests of that system) and automated docking. The ISS hatch opened at 12:37 PM EDT, and the Dragon hatch opened at 1:02 PM EDT, at which point Behnken and Hurley were welcomed onboard the ISS by the existing crew, which includes two U.S. and one Russian astronaut. Hurley and Behnken will now perform standard ISS crew activities, including conducting experiments and research, during the next several weeks, before they climb back into Crew Dragon for the final portion of Demo-2 — the trip back to Earth.

This is the sixth mission for the X-37B, though it’s the first flown under the U.S. Space Force’s supervision, since the space plane was previously operated by the Air Force before the formation of the new wing of the U.S. armed forces. The X-37B runs various missions for the U.S., though its specific aims are actually classified. The uncrewed test vehicle spends long periods in orbit circling the Earth while conducting these missions, with its longest mission to date being a record 780 days for its flight that landed on October 27.

The processor is a field programmable gate array (FPGA), meaning that customers can tweak the hardware to suit their specific needs since the chip is essentially user-configurable hardware. On the machine learning side, Xilinx says that the new processor will offer up to 5.7 tera operations per second of “peak INT8 performance optimized for deep learning,” which is an improvement of as much as 25x vs the previous generation. Xilinx’s new chip has a lot of potential for the satellite market for a couple of reasons: First, it’s a huge leap in terms of processor size, since the company’s existing traditional tolerant silicon was offered in a 65nm spec only. That means big improvements in terms of its size, weight and power efficiency, all of which translates to very important savings when you’re talking about in-space applications, since satellites are designed to be as lightweight and compact as possible to help defray launch costs and in-space propellant needs, both of which represent major expenses in their operation. Finally, its reconfigurable nature means that on-orbit assets can be reprogrammed on-demand to handle different tasks – which now include local machine learning algorithm processing. That means you could theoretically switch one of these in an Earth observation satellite from handling something like tracking cloud density and weather patterns, to making inferences about deforestation or strip mining, for instance. That’s a whole lot of added flexibility for satellite constellation operators looking to move where market demand is needed most. Xilinx’s chips are special in a number of ways vs. the kind we use here on Earth, including with the aforementioned radiation tolerance. They also come packed in thick ceramic packaging which add extra durability both during the launch phase, where stresses include extreme vibration, and on orbit where the lack of an atmosphere means exposure to an extremely harsh environment in terms f both radiation and temperature.

This is the second time they’ve prepared to launch this mission, after an attempt on Wednesday last week was scrubbed due to bad weather . Today’s attempt is set for 3:22 PM EDT (12:22 PM PDT) and preparations, along with the launch itself, will be streamed above starting at 11 AM EDT (8 AM PDT). The launch will take off from Cape Canaveral in Florida, and once again weather is a concern for today’s launch window. SpaceX and NASA have an instantaneous launch window today, which means they only have the one shot to take off – if the weather isn’t cooperating at 3:22 PM EDT, they’ll have to re-attempt the launch again, with the next possible window set for tomorrow, Sunday May 31. This is the first time ever that SpaceX will be launching humans aboard one of its spacecraft – NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley have the honor of being those first passengers. The mission itself is actually technically still a test, the final demonstration mission in the multi-year development of Crew Dragon, SpaceX’s first human-rated spacecraft. This launch will serve as the proof that Crew Dragon and the Falcon 9 rocket that carries it, is ready for human-rating, after which it will be ready for regular operational service, flying U.S. and allied astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS) in low Earth orbit. That will mean the U.S. once again has domestic human launch capabilities, something it hasn’t been able to claim since it ended the Space Shuttle program in 2011. That’s a big deal for a number of reasons, but primarily because it means that NASA won’t rely on buying berths on Russian Soyuz spacecraft to get to the ISS, which will help it save money and ultimately control its own access to Earth’s orbital lab. If successful, SpaceX will be the first of NASA’s two Commercial Crew partners to achieve this milestone. The other, Boeing, is still in the process of working out the kinks of its CST-100 Starliner human crew capsule, which encountered errors during its first uncrewed demonstration mission, resulting in the need to run that launch again sometime later this year, and then, depending on how that goes, fly its first human flight hopefully in 2021. SpaceX, meanwhile, is set to begin operational missions with Crew Dragon later this year, if all goes well with Demo-2. Provided the launch occurs today, Behnken and Hurley will then spend 19 hours on orbit as they make their way to rendezvous with the Space Station for docking. They’ll then staff the station for a period of between a few weeks and a few months, depending on NASA’s decision regarding their ultimate mission length. That will involve helping with station maintenance and conducting experiments, and then they’ll re-enter Crew Dragon and make the trip back to Earth for an Atlantic Ocean splashdown and recovery once their time at the station is over.

This is the first launch for that new rocket, an iteration of China’s Long March launcher that will also be used to take up the sections and components of the country’s forthcoming national orbital space station. This launch flew the crew spacecraft without anyone on board, taking off from Wengchang in China, which is the country’s newest spacecraft launch site. The Long March 5B is a ten engine rocket, including four strapped on boosters that increase its lift capabilities, and represents the nation’s most powerful launch vehicle to date. It lacks a second stage, and is specifically designed for bringing big payloads to low Earth orbit – which is exactly what’s needed for assembling the space station China plans to establish there by 2022. The crew capsule itself will spend a short time in low Earth orbit for its demonstration mission, which is a preparatory step on the way to certifying it for flight. Eventually, the spacecraft will replace the Shenzhou, which is the current vehicle that China uses to bring astronauts to space for rendezvous with orbital stations. It can carry up to six people at once, vs. three on the current model, and can eventually carry astronauts to the Moon. This is a significant mission for China’s space program, and an interesting comparison point for the ongoing Commercial Crew missions by NASA, which is approaching a major milestone with the first demonstration launch of SpaceX’s Commercial Crew spacecraft with astronauts on board on May 27. SpaceX’s Crew Dragon can carry up to seven passengers, depending on configuration.

Intelsat has attempted to position this as a positive moment that sees it embark on a “financial restructuring” project to enable its future growth, but a bankruptcy filing is seldom cause for celebration. The company cites a need to participate in the FCC’s C-band spectrum clearing for 5G network build out in the U.S. as one of the factors behind its decisions to file, as well as “managing the economic slowdown impacting several of its markets caused by the COVID-19 global health crisis.” Intelsat notes that its current plan involves no changes to the day-to-day operation of the company, or any reduction in headcount. The company also said that it has secured $1 billion in committed new financing, which will come in the form of debtor-in-position funds, subject to court approval. That just describes any company that plans to continue to operate its business while also undergoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The company also says it’ll be continuing to launch new satellites, building out its ground network and adding new services as it goes through the process, and that its goal is to get through the restructuring “as quickly as possible.” The satellite operator cites GM and American Airlines as models that show its goal with the filing, having also undertaken a similar restructuring in the past and emerged with greater fiscal viability. Intelsat’s bankruptcy filing isn’t the first noteworthy space company filing resulting from the global pandemic: Would-be global satellite internet provider OneWeb filed for Chapter 11 protection in March .

https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/this-is-certainly-different-astronauts-on-controlling-the-dragon-spacecraft-via-touchscreen/,‘This is certainly different’: Astronauts on controlling the Dragon spacecraft via touchscreen,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Building a brand new spacecraft means knowing when to innovate and when to stick to flight-proven methods, and for Crew Dragon, SpaceX decided to ditch the buttons and dials and go full touchscreen. The astronauts who will fly it later this month have had likewise to ditch years of training and muscle memory — but it’s not all bad, they say. Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, the two astronauts soon to launch to the International Space Station aboard a Dragon capsule, will be the first to actually fly the craft in space. “It’s probably a dream of every test pilot school student to have the opportunity to fly on a brand-new spaceship, and I’m lucky enough to get that opportunity with my good friend here,” said Behnken in a press interview broadcast by NASA. Coronavirus rattles NASA, but Commercial Crew and Mars Perseverance rover are on track Of course they’re more than adequately prepared — not only have they spent countless hours in simulators, but they collaborated with SpaceX from the early days. “It was on the order of at least 5 or 6 years ago that we went out to SpaceX and evaluated a bunch of different control mechanisms,” said Hurley. “They were looking at every which way of flying the vehicle, and ultimately they decided on a touchscreen interface.” “Of course, you know, growing up as a pilot my whole career, having a certain way to control the vehicle, this is certainly different,” he continued. “But we went into it with a very open mind, I think, and worked with them to define the way you interface with it — the way your touches actually registered on the display, in order to be able to fly it cleanly and not make mistakes touching it, not potentially putting in a wrong input.” Compare the photo at the top of the story with the following shot of the physical simulator where astronauts learn to pilot the Russian Soyuz capsule: And of course even modern aircraft are still a mess of physical controls, no doubt familiar to the pilot but inarguably dated in design. Behnke pointed out that these spacecraft are made with a very specific purpose in mind: Going to and docking with the ISS. No one is going to Mars in one of these things, and that impacts how they’re designed and piloted. “The flying task is very unique: To come close to the space station and fly in proximity, then slowly come into contact, is maybe a little bit different from what you would see for flying a space shuttle or an aircraft,” said Behnke, with characteristic understatement (the difference is night and day). “When we evaluated the touchscreen interface we really did focus on the task at hand and trying to get good performance for that specific task.” A prototype Crew Dragon has already launched to the ISS and returned , having been piloted both autonomously and remotely. “It was challenging for us and for them at first to work through those different design issues, but we got to a point where the vehicle, from the manual flying standpoint with the touchscreen, flies very well,” said Hurley. “The difference is you’ve got to be very deliberate when you’re putting in input, relative to what you would do with a stick,” he continued. “Because you know, when you’re flying an airplane for example, if I push the stick forward it’s going to go down. I actually have to make a concerted effort to do that with the touchscreen, if that makes sense.” “I don’t think I’m going too far out on a limb to say that the right answer for all flying is not to switch to a touchscreen, necessarily,” said Behnke. “But for the task that we have and to keep ourselves safe flying close to the ISS, the touchscreen is gonna provide us that capability just fine.” Hurley pointed out that one major advantage is that the controls and readouts are all in the same place: “You’re seeing the docking target, for example, right in the same place you’re looking to fly the vehicle. So it is a little bit different way of doing it, but the design in general has worked out very well.” There’s only so much one can learn in a simulator, though, and this first crewed flight is still very much a test, the feedback from which will inform the next iteration of the capsule. It’s easier, after all, to push a software update than to rewire the pots of 20 different knobs in a system that goes back decades. “We specifically, as part of this test flight, designed in some time in the preflight phase, as well as closer to space station, so we can test out actual manual flying capability of the vehicle,” Hurley explained. “Just to see and verify that it handles the way we expect it to, and the way the simulator shows it to fly. It’s a prudent part of our flight test just like anything else, in case the eventuality happened that a future crew needed to take over manually and fly the spacecraft. So we’re just doing our part, to kinda test out all the different capabilities of the Crew Dragon.” We are sure to hear more about the version of Crew Dragon that will be flying later this month if everything goes according to plan. In the meantime, I have asked both SpaceX and NASA for more information on the control scheme and its development.

The Jeff Bezos-founded space company chose to deliver a bid that included a space industry “dream team” of subcontractors, including Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper, and its Artemis Human Landing System will use the expertise of all three. The Blue Origin bid was one of three that ended up winning a contract form NASA, alongside SpaceX’s Starship and a human landing system developed by Dynetics working with a range of subcontractors. Blue Origin originally debuted its vision of a human lander last year, first with the unveiling of its Blue Moon craft in May , and then with the announcement of its cross-industry “national team” at IAC later in the year. Now, the company has released an animation of how its landing system will work, including Blue Moon docking with a transfer element to bring astronauts over from the Orion capsule that will carry them to the Moon from Earth, as well as the descent stage to actually land, and the ascent stage to take off again from the disposable lander platform and return the astronauts to their ride home. Here’s where each company is involved and what they’re contributing to what you see above: Blue Origin is building the lander proper, which is that platform with legs you see first in the video, and which is left behind on the Moon at the end. Lockheed Martin is building the bubble-like vehicle that attaches to the lander, and which takes off from it at the end. Northrop Grumman is building the long cylinder that connects up with the lander and provides its propulsion through low lunar orbit as it readies to land, and then disconnects before the actual descent. Draper is behind the senses across all of this, delivering avionics for flight control and the landing itself. As mentioned, Blue Origin is one of three companies selected by NASA to develop these lander systems, but its team brings to the table a lot of combined expertise in spaceflight and spacecraft development. The launch system itself will arrive separately from the astronauts on board Orion, making the trip either via a New Glenn rocket built by Blue Origin, which is still in development, or via the United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan, another in-development spacecraft set to take off for the first time next year.

Crew Dragon actually docks with the International Space Station (ISS) fully autonomously, but astronauts are able to take over manual control, should that prove necessary, and this simulator provides what SpaceX says is the “actual interface” that astronauts would use in that instance. The user interface for the docking process is surprisingly simple, given that it reflects the actual UI that astronauts would use on board Crew Dragon. It looks like what you’d expect to find in a virtual cockpit control in a space sim on an iPhone or iPad, which actually makes a lot of sense, as most of the control and information readout displays on board Crew Dragon actually are touchscreens. There are directional arrows on either side, and you can control the orientation of the capsule, as well as its vertical and horizontal position, and toggle between making large or smaller movements in each case. Simple visual feedback in the central targeting reticle gives you an idea of what each control does, providing you a relatively easy way to figure out the control system on your own without much in the way of guidance. A simple help function lets you know that your main goal is to get all figures on the targeting reticle green, but otherwise the main thing you require to get docked successfully is patience. While it’s mostly a fun way to distract yourself, it’s actually also a remarkable first-hand look at SpaceX’s approach to human-centred interface design when it comes to its spacecraft controls. This is very different from the interfaces you’ll see from archive footage taken from NASA’s Apollo or Space Shuttle program, and clearly has been influenced by the modern era of omnipresent touchscreen devices. The proof of its efficacy ultimately depends on how likely it renders the pilot able to succeed with docking, however, so why not give it a shot and see if you can stick the arrival — NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said he managed it on his first try , but he is a former Air Force pilot, so it’s not like he was starting from scratch.

Previously, TechCrunch editorial staff sat down (virtually, of course) with Cowboy Ventures’ Aileen Lee and Ted Wang, Sequoia’s Roelof Botha and Mark Cuban, to name a few. There’s a lot to talk about with Case and Sieg, and Extra Crunch members are encouraged to come with their own set of questions to ask these renowned investors. Revolution is known for its wide range of investments, inside and out of the Valley, so we’re curious how the firm is addressing the COVID-19 crisis. Steve Case was a co-founder of AOL and led the company as it became the internet giant of the ’90s — and did so outside of Silicon Valley. Because of this, he’s long been a champion of startups from other regions. Yet the firm still has a presence in Silicon Valley, and Clara Sieg has run that effort since 2012 after joining in 2010. We’re curious how Case, Sieg and other partners are advising startups to weather this storm. With investments throughout the country, Revolution is in a unique position to have a holistic perspective on how the COVID-19 crisis is affecting startups. Are they still funding startups right now? What metrics are they looking for? What regions of the country do they see less effected than others and which are hardest hit? We have questions and we hope they have answers. can ask their own questions directly in the Zoom Q&A. So come prepared! You can find the full information for the chat below. See you there!

What does the military put in this long-term orbital vehicle? Turns out it’s exactly the kind of neat, but not mind-blowing, science you’d expect to find in such a thing — though solar-powered masers do sound pretty cool. Also known as the Orbital Test Vehicle, the Boeing-designed X-37B has performed five prior missions, amounting to a total of nearly eight years in orbit; the last mission alone was 780 days. But while the craft’s owners (the Air Force, though it is used by many others) are proud to tout its remarkable longevity and reliability, they rarely if ever admit what they’re sending up, or what (if anything) it brings down. While it’s fun to think that it may be truly top secret Area 51-type stuff, it’s much more likely that it’s just run-of-the-mill classified military research. The Defense Department bankrolls an enormous amount of basic science as well as advanced technology, and some of that is bound to require testing in space. While we love and respect our Russian friends with whom we share the ISS, the Pentagon would seem to prefer they didn’t run its experiments, so they have the X-37B. US Air Force experimental test spaceship lands after a record 780 days in orbit On one occasion the Air Force said that the craft tests “advanced guidance, navigation and control, thermal protection systems, avionics, high temperature structures and seals, conformal reusable insulation, lightweight electromechanical flight systems, advanced propulsion systems, advanced materials and autonomous orbital flight, reentry and landing,” which narrows it down a bit. For the spaceplane’s sixth mission, the various departments involved have broken tradition and given details on the payloads . That’s no small feat, given it’s an operation combining the resources of the Air Force, Space Force, Naval Research Lab and NASA. The most broadly interesting experiment has to be a solar-powered microwave laser, or maser, built by the NRL. The device “will transform solar power into radio frequency microwave energy which could then be transmitted to the ground.” The key word there is could, as this type of wireless energy transmission has been pursued for decades. It’s doubtful that a foot-wide solar cell can produce enough energy to be beamed to the surface in measurable levels, but proving the concept piece by piece is something that has to be done in space. And for all we know they’ve already sent multiple precursor device up there on previous missions. Don’t worry that this is some kind of orbital beam weapon that fries surface-dwellers: The total amount of energy collected by a foot-wide cell would be difficult to change into a form that’s harmful a few feet away, let alone 200 miles up through the entire atmosphere. It could, however, be used to beam power to receptive spacecraft or (conceivably) to interfere with poorly protected adversary spacecraft. Two other experiments on board are from NASA, and they have to do with seeing how various items react to being exposed to the space environment. “One is a sample plate evaluating the reaction of select significant materials to the conditions in space. The second studies the effect of ambient space radiation on seeds,” said Air Force Secretary Barbara Barrett. Last — that we know of — is FalconSat-8, an Air Force Academy satellite that will be performing its own unspecified experiments once released into its own orbit by the X-37B. It is itself “an educational platform that will carry five experimental payloads for USAFA to operate This rather large number of items being brought to space is made possible by a “service module” attached for the first time to the aft of the craft and containing some of the hardware. It’s unknown how long this mission will be, but if it’s anything like the others, it will be on the order of months or years.

A reintroduced bill that would provide Americans with a federal rebate of up to $1,500 toward the purchase of an e-bike could help consumers afford higher-quality bikes. That could help reduce the growing number of e-bike fires that have plagued cities like New York. U.S. Representatives Jimmy Panetta (D-CA), Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Adam Schiff (D-CA) reintroduced this week the Electric Bicycle Incentive Kickstart for the Environment (E-BIKE) Act. If passed, the incentives will cover 30% of the cost of a new e-bike, up to a maximum credit of $1,500. Only bikes that are priced at less than $8,000 qualify. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI) has introduced companion legislation in the Senate. Schatz originally introduced the E-BIKE Act in 2021 as part of the Biden administration’s Build Back Better (BBB) Act, which passed in the House of Representatives but didn’t clear the Senate hurdle. The Inflation Reduction Act, which was essentially a shrunken down, negotiated version of the BBB, did pass and was signed into law in August 2022 . The E-BIKE Act was, unfortunately, left out of that bill’s language. The reintroduced bill is designed to both make e-bikes more accessible to lower-income Americans, and ensure that only safe, reputable bikes are eligible for the program. New to this version of the bill is the addition of income caps parallel to existing electric vehicle tax credit caps: an annual salary of $150,000 for single filers, $225,000 for heads of households and $300,000 for those filing jointly. Crucially, the legislation includes additional language to help address battery hazards by defining tax credit-eligible e-bikes as: Having a drive system that has been certified by an accredited laboratory to Underwriters Laboratory (UL) standard UL 2849, or a battery that has been certified to any of the battery safety standards listed in UL 2849 or such other drive system or battery safety standard that is or may be recognized by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission. The UL standard offers electrical and fire safety certification by examining e-bikes’ electrical drive train system, battery system and charger system combinations. “The idea is that the incentive is going to go towards bicycles that are being sold at reputable dealers and meet certain safety and testing standards, so that the products that are coming in direct-to-consumer from China and from brands that aren’t very recognizable and don’t meet any international or recognized testing and electrical safety standards aren’t the ones that are being subsidized for purchase,” Noa Banayan, director of federal affairs at People for Bikes, told TechCrunch. Banayan noted that creating a subsidy for higher-quality products is one of the main ways policymakers and advocates are hoping to phase out potentially dangerous e-bikes. The proposed federal incentive is modeled off of successful local programs in the United States, such as Denver’s 2022 e-bike rebate program. By the end of last year, Denver issued more than 4,700 e-bike rebates, with 67% going to low-income residents. Perhaps even more encouraging, low-income residents reportedly used their bikes 50% more than standard voucher recipients. The program was estimated to have cut 2,040 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2022 and saved nearly $1 million in avoided fuel and electricity costs. Mike Radenbaugh, founder of Rad Power Bikes, told TechCrunch that close to half of the vouchers redeemed in Denver were for Rad bikes. “I think that speaks to an established brand, the largest e-bike brand in North America, and people looking for an e-bike that’s for real, durable, day-to-day transportation,” said Radenbaugh, noting that Rad bikes are built with Samsung, Panasonic and LG battery cells. “I do think a lot of the fly-by-nights, the imitation and knockoff brands, will be most impacted [by this proposed legislation].” Policymakers also hope to phase out low-quality batteries by banning the import and sale of non-compliant lithium-ion rechargeable batteries used in bikes and scooters. New York City — with its thriving ecosystem of gig delivery workers — has been hit particularly hard by battery fires linked to electric micromobility devices. The Fire Department of New York reports that rechargeable lithium-ion batteries have caused more than 400 fires in the last four years (200 of which occurred last year), resulting in more than 300 injuries, 12 deaths and damage to more than 320 structures. At the local level, NYC Mayor Eric Adams announced an action plan earlier this week to stop battery fires and promote safe electric micromobility usage. Part of that plan was the signing of a law to prohibit the sale, lease or rental of e-bikes and scooters and storage batteries that fail to meet recognized safety standards, and another to prohibit the assembly, reconditioning or sale of “lithium-ion batteries using cells removed from used storage batteries.” Aside from low-quality batteries, George Kerchner, executive director of the Rechargeable Battery Association, an industry trade group, says refurbishing batteries is another major cause of fires. “When you’re modifying a battery design that has safety features associated with it, and you’re in there tinkering with it, that certainly has the possibility of compromising those safety features that the battery has built in,” Kerchner told TechCrunch. There are also moves at the state level to ban non-compliant batteries. U.S. Representative Ritchie Torres, a Democrat who represents the South Bronx, proposed federal legislation on March 7 that would require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to establish a final consumer product safety standard for e-bikes and e-scooters to protect against the risk of fires. The proposal came two days after a battery powering an e-scooter exploded in a Bronx supermarket and food plaza and caused a five-alarm fire . The one problem with legislation designed to prohibit the sale or rental of vehicles that fail to meet safety standards is that it’ll be incredibly difficult to enforce it, says Kerchner. “I think the incentives will go a long way and will be more effective than the ban itself,” he said. “At the end of the day, a good quality bike is relatively expensive, and providing an incentive to buy a higher-quality bike and providing those discounts will raise the bar, and you’ll see fewer fires as a result of that.” Topics Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch, where she covers Tesla and Elon Musk’s broader empire, autonomy, AI, electrification, gig work platforms, Big Tech regulatory scrutiny, and more.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/29/lyft-might-drop-shared-rides-stay-focused-on-basics-under-new-ceo/,"Lyft might drop shared rides, stay focused on basics under new CEO",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Lyft might once again drop its shared rides offering, just one of several changes the company’s newly appointed CEO could make in a bid to focus on its core ride-hailing business and become profitable. David Risher, who is taking over as Lyft’s CEO in mid-April , told TechCrunch in a wide-ranging interview that other features may also be axed. For instance, the Wait & Save feature, which allows riders in certain regions to pay a lower fare if they wait for the best-located driver, may end, he said. “It’s possible that maybe we don’t need both of those anymore and that we can focus all our resources on doing a fewer number of things better,” Risher, the former Amazon executive, told TechCrunch. “Maybe it’s time for us to say the shared rides were great for a time, but it’s time to let that go.” Lyft, co-founded by Logan Green and John Zimmer, launched shared rides in 2014 on a small scale before expanding the service. Uber launched Uber Pool the same year. Both companies dropped their carpooling services during the pandemic before reinstating new versions later . For Uber and Lyft, carpooling has historically been a money pit, a loss-generating ploy to attract riders with cheap fares. While nothing is yet decided, the potential move is an example of how Lyft’s new management hopes to stem its losses and, eventually, pry some market share back from its main competitor and oft-described big brother Uber. Instead of adding new products like delivery or even selling the company (both of which Risher says aren’t going to happen), Lyft is going back to basics. “The first order of business here is to focus on the basics of ride-share,” Risher said. “The reason I say that is because in this type of marketplace where you have competitors, you can’t be losing share to the other guy if you want to be around long term. And I think this duopoly is a good thing. In so many other markets, you really want, as a customer, some choice, and I think as a driver, you want choice. It keeps us honest and allows us to play off one another a bit.” Uber, already a larger company, has taken more U.S. market share from Lyft in recent years, through an all-of-the-above approach that includes food delivery and even transit services. Today Uber’s market share has grown from 62% at the start of 2020 to about 74% today versus Lyft’s 26%, according to YipitData. Another study from Similarweb shows that Uber leads in monthly active users (MAUs), and that lead has grown over time. In February 2023 alone, Uber had 9.4 million MAUs, a 62% lead over Lyft’s MAU of 5.8 million. This time last year, Uber only had a 48% advantage over Lyft. Similarweb’s data also shows that Uber outranks Lyft on both Apple’s and Google’s app stores, and that over the past 12 months, its Android downloads were 22% higher than Lyft’s. Uber has taken a different approach to Lyft in pursuit of profits. While Lyft has stuck with ride-hailing, Uber has expanded into delivery through its UberEats platform and added a a slew of new products as it aims to attract users but also create a closed business loop wherein each product feeds customers back into other Uber channels. “We are actively cross-selling food delivery consumers into grocery, grocery consumers into alcohol, and actually back now to mobility,” said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi during the company’s third quarter 2022 earnings call held November 1. “All of the cross-sell that we have across the platform continues to increase, drive new customers and drive retention, as well.” Risher said Lyft won’t try to compete with Uber by introducing a delivery product to the app, in part because he doesn’t consider delivery to be either a customer or driver-driven decision. “From a driver’s perspective, they’re now shuttling in their mind between picking up a person versus picking up a pizza,” said Risher. “And when I pick up a pizza, I have to double park at the restaurant with seven other people, then I get a ticket once every couple of weeks, then I gotta get in my car again and drive, then get out and ring the doorbell. It’s a very different cycle than, ‘I’m picking people up and I’m just transporting them.’” He also said riders might not want to be in a car that just dropped off a couple of pizzas. “I think for a lot of people, Lyft has gone from top of mind to a little bit on the side, so it’s our job to remind people we exist and really give them a great experience,” said Risher. That might mean ensuring Lyft doesn’t charge more than the competition and that its drivers pick up and drop off customers on time. In the past, Lyft was an attractive option because it offered cheaper rides than Uber. Now, after the post-COVID driver shortage, Lyft’s average price per mile is on par with Uber’s, according to more research from YipitData. Risher didn’t say if Lyft will cut its workforce in an effort to rein in costs. However, CFO Elaine Paul hinted at taking such measures during the company’s fourth quarter 2022 earnings call . Paul also suggested Lyft shift to hiring workers outside the U.S. who are less likely to expect equity as part of compensation. “I don’t think we’ve given riders or bikers enough of a good reason to come and try us out on ride-share, as an example,” he said, noting that he is an avid cyclist. “If we have both of these ways for people to get around, how can they reinforce each other, because right now they’re a little too parallel.” Lyft currently offers the Lyft Pink membership program that provide riders with ride-hail perks like free priority pickup upgrades and relaxed cancellations, as well as bike and scooter discounts. The membership also includes free Grubhub+ for a year and SIXT car rental upgrades, which represent a half-hearted attempt to capture more of the transportation market through partnerships. Lyft went public in March 2019 at a value of $24 billion. Today, Lyft’s market capitalization is around $3.35 billion. Uber’s market cap is $60.44 billion. Investors initially reacted favorably to Risher’s appointment, pushing its share price to $10.14 immediately following the announcement. But the positive reaction has been short-lived. Lyft’s share price has fallen 11.4% from Tuesday’s high to close Wednesday at $8.98. Tom White, senior research analyst at D.A. Davidson, told TechCrunch he remains neutral on the company with a $12.50 price target. “We’ll admit the news came as somewhat of a surprise to us, but perhaps it shouldn’t have given the relative underperformance of LYFT shares and in Lyft’s core ride-sharing business in recent quarters,” said White. Lyft’s Q1 2023 revenue outlook remained unchanged by Risher’s appointment, but analysts recall that Lyft’s target ($975 million) was lower than what they had expected ($1.09 billion). Lyft attributed the reduced outlook to colder weather, which leads to fewer ride-hail rides, shorter trips and a major dip in micromobility usage. Since Lyft is only active in North America, the company lacks the ability to balance poor ridership in one wintry part of the world with increased usage in other, warmer places. Although Lyft’s strategy so far lacks the dazzle of shiny new products that might directly compete with Uber, Risher has some pretty good incentives to turn the company around (that is, aside from the pride of a job well done). “As part of his equity compensation, [new CEO John Risher] received 12.25 million performance-based restricted stock units, broken into nine tranches, each vesting separately at LYFT price hurdles from $15.00 to $80.00,” said Ben Silverman, director of research at investment research management firm VerityData. “The vesting schedule is vastly different from the founders’ awards received by Logan [Green] and [John] Zimmer in 2021 and 2022 which only vest if LYFT hits or exceeds $100.00. Clearly, that aspirational view has been muted. Regardless, Risher is tasked with a massive turnaround and if fully successful, can earn $980 million.” Topics Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch, where she covers Tesla and Elon Musk’s broader empire, autonomy, AI, electrification, gig work platforms, Big Tech regulatory scrutiny, and more.

The researchers, who work for security firm Synacktiv , found the vulnerabilities and showcased them at the Pwn2Own conference in Vancouver last week. The worst-case scenario allowed by these vulnerabilities, at least as far as the researchers know, is to mess with a driver with some annoying, and potentially disruptive tactics. The good news, at least according to what Tesla told the researchers, is that they couldn’t have turned on and off the car, or steered the wheel. Though, according to Eloi Benoist-Vanderbeken , one of the researchers, perhaps it would have been possible. “[Tesla] said we wouldn’t be able to turn the steering wheel, accelerate or brake. But from our understanding of the car architecture we are not sure that this is correct, but we don’t have proof of it,” he said, because they don’t have full access to a Tesla at the moment. But they look forward to fact-checking the company’s statements as soon as they get their own Tesla. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. The first vulnerability was exploitable via Bluetooth, the second one allowed the researchers to elevate their privileges and become root — cybersecurity lingo for the highest level of system access — giving them free rein to execute code in the infotainment system; the last one gave them control of the security gateway, a component that sends some commands to the car. The researchers highlighted that despite these vulnerabilities, Tesla is doing a good job making the car hard to hack, implementing a mature system of sandboxes, which isolates components and makes it harder to get higher privileges by just hacking into one of them. “It’s not at the point of a modern browser running on an iPhone or an Android, but it’s not that far from it,” Vincent Dehors said in an interview. “Tesla cars are really well connected to the internet, so they need to take care of security because they are likely to be targeted more than other cars.” The researchers said that Tesla is working on making patches for these vulnerabilities and the updates should be pushed to cars soon.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/21/kakao-mobility-picks-up-super-app-startup-splyt-once-backed-by-softbank-and-grab/,"Kakao Mobility picks up ‘super app’ startup Splyt, once backed by SoftBank and Grab",Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Kakao Mobility , the ride-hailing subsidiary of South Korean messaging and internet giant Kakao, has made its first acquisition as it looks to raise its international profile. It has acquired Splyt , a startup out of London that works with apps in areas like travel, ride-hailing and finance to help them build out “super app” strategies by integrating other services. Kakao Mobility has already worked with Splyt, and it wants to use the asset to spur global expansion plans across Southeast Asia and Europe. Kakao Mobility currently offers limited services in about 30 markets outside of South Korea: most recently, it launched in Guam last year and Laos earlier this year. “Splyt and Kakao Mobility’s technology teams have been collaborating since 2019 to integrate and enable global ride-hailing services for Kakao T users through Splyt’s ride-hailing API platform,” CTO of Splyt Stephen Mason told TechCrunch. Splyt wants to connect the world’s ride-hailing apps for easy international roaming Financial terms of the deal are not being disclosed, but there are some signs that it may not have been a super outcome for this super app enabler. Splyt says its services are used by more than 2 billion people in 150 countries by way of customers like Alipay, Uber, Binance, Grab, Trip.com, Booking.com, Kakao itself and 70 others. But after a flurry of activity over the last several years — including raising $33.5 million from SoftBank , Grab , AmEx and others, per PitchBook data — Splyt stopped providing updates about its business in July 2022. The acquisition will include technology and talent. Splyt has around 30 staff, and they will join Kakao Mobility. Key management at Splyt will move to South Korea to continue to manage and integrate the team into Kakao Mobility, a spokesperson for the latter company said. (Kakao Mobility has about 950 employees.) It’s not yet clear how Kakao Mobility intends to use Splyt’s tech: using it as a lever to work with a wider network of international partners or using it to extend Kakao Mobility’s own app, Kakao T, which currently has around 32 million registered users. Kakao Mobility itself is at a crossroads as a business: The company was originally partly spun out of Kakao Corporation in 2017, and it is still 58% owned by it. But last year Kakao had to shelve plans to sell part of that stake to a PE firm after pushback from drivers and employees. A further plan for an IPO has also been put on hold amid a cool market for tech stocks at the moment. Other investors in the mobility business have included Carlyle, TPG, LG and Google, which have poured more than $840 million into it. A report last year in Korea Economic Daily notes that Kakao Mobility — which, in addition to ride-hailing also offers parking space searches, navigation, bike rental and has worked on autonomous driving — was valued at $6.5 billion. Splyt’s emergence as a business speaks to a very particular time in the on-demand services market. Apps like Grab, Uber, Didi, Lyft, Ola and many others collectively raised billions of dollars to compete against each other and build out networks of gig workers and customers. Intense competition on a narrow range of services, however, made for very challenging unit economics, so a lot of these companies focused on folding in more services into those apps to improve loyalty and increase customer spend — and thus the so-called “super app” was born. The complexity of integrating different services was a challenge in itself, however, and that was where Splyt stepped in, providing the tech behind the scenes to integrate services and reconcile payments between various parties. That in itself was enough to bring on SoftBank as an investor. When it led a $19.5 million round in the startup in 2019, SoftBank was a big backer of a number of these on-demand businesses, and it was also in search of its own entry point into the “super app” fray, and so the investment was seen as a way to help it on both of those fronts. But fast-forward to today, and a lot of the companies running these apps, not to mention SoftBank itself, have been struggling to grow and justify their investment exuberance of past years. All of that may have spelled splitsville for Splyt, but perhaps an opportunity too for Kakao Mobility to pick up the pieces for its own ends. “We will create a new service that innovates the mobility experience of users around the world by incorporating Kakao Mobility’s platform capabilities into the global super app network that Split has built,” CEO and co-founder of Splyt Philipp Mintchin said. “We’re thrilled to welcome Splyt, which is the first overseas acquisition [of Kakao Mobility],” said Alex Ryu in a statement. “Kakao Mobility will continue to scale our product and accelerate further global expansions through Splyt, which has unrivaled global competitiveness in the mobility service platform space.” Topics Reporter, Asia Kate Park is a reporter at TechCrunch, with a focus on technology, startups and venture capital in Asia.

Ford lost about $3 billion on its EV and digital services business over the past two years, a unit now known as Model e, and isn’t expected to be profitable (on an adjusted basis that removes costs like taxes) until late 2026 with an 8% operating profit margin, the company said Thursday. Meanwhile, its commercial and traditional internal combustion engine business units were profitable enough to offset losses incurred by making and selling electric vehicles. In other words, profits generated from selling internal combustion engine-powered trucks, cars and SUVs have helped, and will continue to help, drive Ford’s push into EVs. Ford lifted the hood Thursday on how the restructured 119-year-old company will operate and, importantly, report its financials. Earnings reports, which Ford restated for 2021 and 2022, will no longer be broken out by region. Instead, financial reports, which includes revenue, profits and losses, margins and adjusted earnings, will give details on three global segments of business that cover EV and digital services, traditional internal combustion engine business and its commercial vehicles. And while CFO John Lawler stressed to TechCrunch that this is not merely an accounting exercise, the numbers do provide fresh insight into the company’s financial standing. “If we just did business as usual, I think what we felt is that the company wouldn’t change enough, the dynamics within the company would not have changed,” Lawler said in a recent interview explaining the decision to restructure. “It’s about focus. It’s about speed and accountability. And I don’t think we would see the clock speed increasing.” Last March, Ford announced plans to restructure and break the company into three segments : Ford Blue for its internal combustion and hybrid vehicles, Ford Pro for the commercial business and Ford Model e, which covers electric vehicles, advanced driver assistance systems and digital services. The newly formed Latitude AI, which is part of the ADAS team led by Sammy Omari, also falls under Ford Model e. The newly restructured company and its accompanying financials also breaks out Ford Credit, the company’s financing arm and Ford Next, which is where its longer-term pre-revenue businesses sit. The upshot? For now, the EV and digital services business, which Lawler said should be viewed as a startup, is unprofitable while the other two are gaining ground, on an adjusted earnings basis. As a recap, Ford reported in February that on an adjusted basis it earned $10.4 billion for all of 2022. Ford’s net income on an adjusted earnings before interest and taxes in 2021 was $10 billion. On Thursday, Ford issued the restated earnings, which shows the Model e unit had losses of $900 million in 2021 and $2.1 billion in 2022. Ford currently has three EVs in its portfolio: the Mustang Mach e, the F-150 Lightning truck and the commercial transit van. Meanwhile, Ford Pro saw profits increase from $2.7 billion in 2021 to $3.2 billion in 2022. Ford Blue brought in the bulk of profits, earning $3.3 billion in 2021 and jumping to $6.8 billion in 2022. The automaker forecast that its Ford Blue unit will earn, on an adjusted basis, $7 billion in profits in 2023. Ford Blue will approach $6 billion in profits, nearly double its 2022 earnings. And Model e, the EV and digital services unit, is forecast to lose $3 billion in 2023, a loss driven by a number of capital projects including building new factories such as the $5.6 billion BlueOval city complex in Tennessee. Those costs also include work on future generations of EVs. Lawler said in a recent interview that the company is working on second, and even third-generations of its EVs. “We’re working on our second generation that launches mid decade,” Lawler said. “It’s a clean sheet of paper. It’s a completely different way of designing the vehicles. And in fact, we’re already working on our third generation when most of our competitors are just launching their first generation of vehicles. And so I think that puts us in a in unique position.” The company reiterated that Ford Model e will reach profitability before taxes by late 2026 with an 8% pretax profit margin. That milestone that is tied to planned EV production run rates of 600,000 units by the end of 2023 and two million by the end of 2026. Ford also confirmed that it expects full-year adjusted EBIT to be $9 billion to $11 billion and adjusted free cash flow to be about $6 billion. If Ford wants to hit those metrics, it will mean more than just producing and selling EVs. The company has struggled to keep its costs under control and improve operating efficiencies — a problem that many of its rivals have mastered.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/27/lyft-ceo-and-president-stepping-down-to-be-replaced-by-former-amazon-exec/,Lyft CEO and president stepping down to be replaced by former Amazon exec,Latest,"ment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us UPDATE: This article has been updated with compensation package information for Green, Zimmer and Risher. Lyft co-founders, CEO Logan Green and president John Zimmer, are stepping down from their roles by mid-April, the company said Wednesday. They will serve as chair and vice chair of Lyft’s board, respectively. David Risher, a former retail executive at Amazon, will take over the CEO position at Lyft. Lyft’s current chairman, Sean Aggarwal, will step down from his post but will stay on the board. Green and Zimmer founded Lyft in 2012. Back then, the company was mainly differentiated from Uber by the presence of pink mustaches on Lyft vehicles. Back then, Zimmer told TechCrunch that Lyft had originally thought of doing the service just for women, “as a safety kind of service and a very particular clientele.” Lyft ditched the mustache in 2016 and went public three years later. When it debuted, Lyft raised more than $2 billion in an afternoon after pricing its shares at $72 each. Today, Lyft closed at $9.60 per share; however, the stock price did jump nearly 6% after hours on the news of Risher taking over as CEO. Risher joined Amazon in 1997 as the company’s first VP of product and store development. He moved up through the ranks at the side of Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos, and served as SVP of marketing and merchandising before leaving Amazon in 2002. He helped transform the company from an online bookstore with $15 million in annual sales to the “everything store” with over $4 billion in sales, according to a statement from Lyft. Today Risher is the CEO and co-founder of Worldreader, a nonprofit that aims to get children interested in reading. Perhaps it is this community-minded spirit that aligns well with Lyft’s original founding goals as a company. He will step down as CEO there and stay on as board president, according to a LinkedIn post . Risher, who joined the Lyft board of directors in 2021, will take over the full leadership responsibilities for the company’s operations on April 17, according to the company. Lyft said there would be no change to the company’s previously announced first-quarter 2023 revenue, contribution margin and adjusted EBITDA outlook. When Lyft shared its fourth-quarter and full year 2022 earnings in February, the company lowered its revenue expectations for Q1 2023 to $975 million, a decline of about $200 million. Analysts had expected the company to promise $1.09 billion in revenue. That guidance sent shares tumbling 25% in after-hours trading to $12.13, and they have continued to drop in the intervening weeks. According to SEC filings , Lyft is paying Risher an annual salary of $725,000, with an annual target bonus opportunity of 100% of that salary for each fiscal year he’s employed with Lyft, based on the achievement of certain performance goals. This year, though, his annual bonus will be $1 million as long as he stays with the company through mid-March 2024. Risher is also getting a signing bonus of $3.25 million. The new CEO’s compensation package includes an award of performance-based restricted stock units covering a total of 12.25 million shares, which Risher can vest upon the attainment of certain stock price goals. Green and Zimmer will receive $450,000 cash each for their positions on the board. They will both maintain their original award agreements on a pre-set timeline as long as they remain service providers to the company. If they get fired, that timeline accelerates and they will be able to access their equity awards as defined in Lyft’s 2019 equity incentive plan . On top of that, they’ll both be granted an award of restricted stock units covering a number of shares of Lyft’s stock with a value of $260,000, effective on the date of the company’s annual meeting of stockholders. And despite the move away from day-to-day operations, Lyft’s dual-class structure empowers Green and Zimmer long after they leave the company. They both still hold high-voting shares that entitle them to 20 votes per share until both of them are dead. If one dies or becomes incapacitated, Lyft’s sunset clause enables the remaining co-founder to control the votes of the deceased/incapacitated co-founder. And when they’re both dead, a trustee will retain the last living co-founder’s full voting powers for a transition period of nine to 18 months.
