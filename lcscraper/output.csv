https://nearshoreamericas.com/year-of-droughts-and-wildfires-hits-south-america-hard/,Year of Droughts and Wildfires Hits South America Hard - Nearshore Americas,2025-03-12T13:04:18+00:00,"South America appears to be at the frontline of the climate crisis blamed on global warming, with wildfires wreaking havoc across the region.","South America appears to be at the frontline of the climate crisis blamed on global warming.  In 2024, a staggering 79 million hectares — an area dwarfing entire nations — were consumed by wildfires. Bolivia lost over 16 million hectares, nearly 15% of its land, an expanse exceeding the size of Nicaragua. Brazil’s vastness offered no sanctuary, as 59.2 million hectares, a territory equivalent to Paraguay, turned to ash. Venezuela, second only to Bolivia in devastation, saw 9% of its sovereign land reduced to a charred wasteland. The inferno killed hundreds of people and left thousands of homes damaged. Wildfires are nothing new to South America, but never before had they threatened urban centers on this scale. In February last year, flames engulfed several smaller towns of Chile’s Vilapraso, reducing hundreds of houses to ash, while in Argentina, residents of Capilla del Monte and Los Cocos were to be evacuated as the inferno closed in. The worst-hit regions include Brazil’s northern Amazon, Venezuela’s Maracaibo, and the Gran Chaco, which stretches across Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay. Relentless droughts and sudden floods are upending economies. Failed crops are pushing rural families into urban slums. Reservoirs are drying up , crippling hydroelectric power supplies in Ecuador and Colombia. Increasing Dry Days South America is drying out at an alarming rate, according to a recent study by Communications Earth and Environment . Fifty years ago, the region experienced about 180 dry days a year. Today, that number has surged to 240 — meaning 60 more parched days annually. Paradoxically, rising temperatures are also making storms more violent. As the air holds more moisture, the risk of destructive floods intensifies. Last weekend, Argentina’s port city of Bahía Blanca was blindsided by a sudden deluge. Torrential rains dumped 260 millimeters (10 inches) of water in mere hours, triggering deadly flash floods that killed 16 people. “The region is experiencing sudden and dramatic swings between extreme wet and dry conditions,” said Max Dugan-Knight , a climate scientist with Deep Sky , a Canadian startup aiming to remove gigatons of carbon from the atmosphere. This climatic phenomenon is called “hydroclimate whiplash,” Max added. “These swings might seem like a useful balance, but they are extremely dangerous because they cause flooding and mudslides on the one hand, and wildfires and water scarcity on the other, sometimes in quick succession.” Hydroclimate whiplash was on full display in Bogotá last spring. Months of extreme drought gave way to a deadly flood in November, wreaking havoc on the city of 12 million people. Max warns that this volatility is crippling the region’s agriculture. “That’s why Argentina’s wheat and soybean production has taken such a massive hit. The same goes for Brazil’s coffee industry — water shortages and relentless heat waves have severely impacted yields over the past year.” Chile: The Worst Victim Chile suffered the worst wildfire disaster of any country. In February 2024, the raging fires killed about 136 people and injured nearly 1,200, according to the Pan American Health Organization. In Viña del Mar alone, more than 1,600 people lost their homes as entire neighborhoods burned to the ground. Many survivors took refuge in schools, churches, and hotels. The fires devastated over 64,326 hectares, damaging nearly 15,000 homes — around 6,600 destroyed. In response, the Chilean government declared a State of Constitutional Catastrophe until April 3, 2024. The government estimates the damage at $4.39 billion, which doesn’t include indirect losses such as reduced productivity, environmental destruction, and long-term health effects. “Chile is grappling with persistent drought and severe wildfire seasons,” said Abigail Wellman at T eamPlanting , an Inwood, NY-based company carrying out several reforestation projects across Latin America. Searching for Solutions There’s no quick fix to shield South America from worsening climate change, but the region can strengthen its defenses. “Some of the best defenses available are natural resources like forests, wetlands, and mangroves. These provide a buffer against flooding and can reduce wildfire risk,” Max said. “Prolonged drought can damage the region’s energy security . This means governments should diversify their energy mix, adding more renewables like solar and wind.” Wellman urged immediate action—investing in sustainable practices and early-warning systems to better prepare for extreme weather. Encouraging rural communities to plant trees on a large scale could also help, as trees act as natural shields against drought.

As the saturation of more established hubs in Mexico, Colombia and various Central American countries solidifies, Hermosillo’s providers plan to attract more businesses, according to government officials and industry leaders present during the “BPO Influencers and CX Leadership Summit” on March 14. The summit was organized by Alliance BPO Services , a Hermosillo-based BPO provider with global presence for multiple industries in North America, Latin America & Caribbean. Alliance BPO Services offers custom-tailored agreements, with performance commitments aligned to their client success, instead of standard service contracts. Local insights are crucial to understanding why Hermosillo is capturing interest and how it compares with established BPO hotspots in the region. Local Talent Pool and Workforce Dynamics Around a dozen international BPOs currently operate in Hermosillo, according to research from the firm Ryan Strategic Advisory . The city boasts a young, educated workforce, a significant advantage for BPO firms. Hermosillo has a population of around one million people. “The fresh talent coming out of our universities is not only tech-savvy but also adaptable. We see graduates translating their knowledge into real-world skills for service excellence,” said local entrepreneur and Alliance BPO Services CEO Juan Caire. Caire added that Hermosillo’s universities and technical schools are focusing on producing graduates well-versed in technology, administration, and languages, which is essential for catering to diverse client needs. This growing talent pool allows companies like Alliance BPO Services to meet specific customer demands effectively. “Our clients frequently note that our staff’s linguistic abilities and cultural familiarity with the US audience set us apart; it’s more than just outsourcing; it is about creating a seamless extension of their teams,” said Alliance BPO Services Co-founder Daniel Castilla. For Peter Ryan, President and Principal Analyst of Ryan Strategic Advisory, Alliance BPO Services is taking a pragmatic and practical approach to its development of AI tools. “By applying the technology in areas in which it can make a positive difference to the consumer, as opposed to pushing it into use cases where it may not be ready, Alliance BPO is likely to gain traction from its current and existing clients searching for a full service provider,” Ryan told Nearshore Americas. Adopting Technology and AI Hermosillo operators understand that they are pursuing market shares growth in highly competitive market macro conditions. Firms like Alliance BPO Services expect that an “all in” approach to technology will differentiate their unique value proposition. Alliance BPO Services is pioneering efforts to integrate artificial intelligence into their operations, not to substitute human agents, but to enhance their capabilities. “AI enables us to improve efficiency and quality of service. Clients are responding positively, reporting faster response times and improved satisfaction through AI-supported customer interactions. We are not trying to replace our employees but help them identify gaps and improve their performance,” Castilla said. Live translation technologies are becoming a staple. “With our ability to communicate in real time with customers across cultures, we can bridge language barriers that have historically impeded efficiency,” Caire said. This tech-savvy approach ensures that Hermosillo remains competitive, particularly in industries that require immediate and multilingual support. Strategic Location and Market Access Hermosillo’s geographical positioning near the U.S. border is another factor that enhances its appeal. Proximity allows companies to effectively manage cross-border operations with minimal cultural and time zone discrepancies. According to the CEO and Founder of SupportU Hui Curtis, “Hermosillo’s location enables firms to provide robust customer support services that resonate with US clients.” This geographical advantage is not just theoretical; local BPO firms report being able to align workflows with US business hours, reducing lag and enhancing service delivery. SupportU currently assists a client doing business out of Hermosillo. Ongoing investments in infrastructure, particularly in transportation and communication networks, will bolster this advantage. Challenges on the horizon The visibility of Hermosillo as a BPO destination outside of Mexico is limited. “We need to advocate more effectively for our capabilities and the talent we offer to attract international clients,” said Arturo Fernandez, President of Sonora Global. This raises the issue of effective marketing and branding for the city’s BPO services. “I see two main challenges — the first is gaining visibility, in a sea of nearshore options.  It will be important for the Hermosillo stakeholders in private and public domains to work together to make certain their community is part of the broader Mexican / nearshore discussion.  The second one is air connections — it will be essential for the business community to lobby for more flights into the city from the U.S. and other foreign ports.  Currently, for business travelers it can be cumbersome to visit,” Ryan added. Navigating regulatory challenges is another ongoing concern. Firms must ensure compliance with local, state, and federal regulations as they expand. Streamlined regulations could play a vital role in easing entry and operation for new BPO companies. “We are digitizing a large amount of the permitting process, aiming to have a complete digital process during the next two years,” Daniel Gastélum, director of the local economic development agency said during the summit. The Road Ahead The future of Hermosillo’s BPO sector hinges on how it addresses its challenges while continuing to capitalize on its strengths. The focus on technological integration, a strong local workforce and strategic market positioning offers potential for meaningful growth. As Caire stated: “Our commitment to improving and adapting is not just about survival; it is about thriving in a competitive landscape.” With a unified approach, Hermosillo could solidify its reputation as a viable, dynamic player in the global BPO arena.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/tnvisa-scrutiny-rising-under-trump-2-0/,TN Visa Scrutiny Rising Under Trump 2.0 - Nearshore Americas,2025-03-18T12:38:21+00:00,"Jasmine Mooney, a 35-year-old Canadian business consultant, recently spent 11 days under detention by U.S. immigration officials after attempting to enter the country through Mexico with a TN visa application. Three months prior, Mooney’s work visa was revoked while attempting to travel to Los Angeles over what she claimed was a paperwork issue that Vancouver","Jasmine Mooney, a 35-year-old Canadian business consultant, recently spent 11 days under detention by U.S. immigration officials after attempting to enter the country through Mexico with a TN visa application. Three months prior, Mooney’s work visa was revoked while attempting to travel to Los Angeles over what she claimed was a paperwork issue that Vancouver airport customs officers would not elaborate on. Her attempt at reentering the country with a new TN application at the Mexican border ended with her being sent to three different detention facilities in a process she later described as “a deeply disturbing psychological experiment.” According to immigration attorneys nationwide, Mooney’s experience is becoming increasingly common. It is another example of the increasing scrutiny of current TN visa holders and applicants under U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. Sudden difficulties with the TN visa are in stark contrast with the relatively smooth and easy pathway reported on many times in previous coverage in Nearshore Americas over the years. One of the ‘Easiest’ Ways to Come to America The TN visa was formed in 1994 under the North American Free Trade Agreement as a way for Mexican and Canadian citizens to fast-track entry into the United States for in-demand jobs that mostly require bachelor’s degrees, such as pharmacists, dentists, school teachers, engineers, and computer systems analysts. Mexican citizens have long enjoyed the benefits of the TN Visa program, which sets the Latin American country apart from its southern neighbors who are not included in the initiative. During Trump’s first term, immigration negotiations with Canada and Mexico took a backseat to more business-minded ventures. Considered a nonimmigrant visa, the TN program was responsible for bringing more than 33,000 employees to the country in 2022. In 2020, the program continued under NAFTA’s successor, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which made no changes to the requirements of the TN process, likely due to its effectiveness in bringing educated workers to the country and having very few documented instances of abuse or fraud. But that isn’t stopping immigration officials from cracking down on the application process after Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 titled “Protecting the American People Against Invasion.” “We’re seeing a trend where it is becoming harder for some Mexican nationals under some job descriptions — engineers, animal breeders and consultants — are having a harder time getting their applications approved,” said Ingrid Perez, an employment-based immigration attorney who founded IBP Immigration Law in Orlando, Florida. “There are reports recently that in Mexico TN adjudications aren’t very consistent, and a lot of times that has to do with the people adjudicating the visas and the guidance they received.” A Year Away From Review In early 2026, the U.S. Trade Representative is expected to produce a report to Congress on the workings of the USMCA as part of a mandated joint review between the North American countries. That review will begin on July 1, 2026. “We’re not really sure what could happen with TN visas next year,” Perez said. “The America First Trade Policy is centered around protecting U.S. workers and U.S. jobs — and that revision they’re going to be doing next year is an opportunity for the Trump administration to perhaps have a really great impact on TN visas.” Perez said many immigration attorneys expect the increased scrutiny to continue through 2026. Some anticipate greater compliance requirements, stricter documentation requirements, and a renewed focus on job verification. She said the new administration may also use the highly successful TN program as a bargaining chip to force concessions from Canada or Mexico. “It’s kind of hard to know, exactly,” she said. Sophie Alcorn, founder of Palo Alto, California-based Alcorn Immigration Law , said changes could happen with the TN visa program and others like it before the review concludes in 2026. “In other immigration categories, we are seeing policy changes that affect the adjudication standards even though the law remains unchanged, so it is theoretically possible that TN enforcement or interpretation could change in 2025 before any potential actual changes to the treaty could happen,” she said. Processing Times Remain in Check While denials may be rising, processing times have remained relatively unchanged for TN visa applicants aside from a change in law interpretation by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services regarding its premium processing service, which costs $2,805. “Instead of calendar days, now it’s business days,” Alcorn explained. “So instead of 15 calendar days to get a response, now it’s about three weeks to get a response.” Alcorn said she has heard anecdotal reports of premium processing snags with TN visas, and she personally has experienced the issue with extraordinary ability Green Card cases that were slated for processing by early January but are just now receiving responses. “In those situations, our clients are getting refunds of their premium processing filing fees,” she said. Perez said if the processing struggles spill over from premium into regular processing, it could bring significant issues to the immigration system and disproportionately hurt small businesses. “If it’s a large employer hiring a large number of people, they might not feel the pains of increased processing times as much, but these employers who maybe rely on one TN professional, they’ll hurt,” she said. “It’s going to be important for businesses to have a backup plan and understanding that perhaps immigration doesn’t work with our timeline; we have to work with theirs.” Attorneys are also speculating whether the large-scale government layoffs occurring under Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency could add fuel to the processing-time fire in the future. Alcorn said the immigration system, with its self-funded structure through applicants paying most of the costs, may be insulated from those potential effects. “The other question I have is: Will the administration make any subsequent announcements on immigration policies to support companies that are bringing manufacturing to the United States in response to tariffs? Will there be any streamlined immigration support for those countries to be able to do business here?” Alcorn inquired. Alcorn said questions such as those arose after the notable fracture in immigration philosophy following Musk’s promotion of HB-1 visas amid Trump’s push for an America-first business model. “There are things signaling that this government is proactively trying to recruit really smart people into the country for entrepreneurship and manufacturing.” Comment Name *  Email *  Website   Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/declining-us-dollar-could-trigger-far-reaching-disruption/,Declining US Dollar Could Trigger Far-Reaching Disruption - Nearshore Americas,2025-03-25T13:53:34+00:00,"The declining US dollar looks set to pose new challenges to service exporters across Latin America. From tourism to BPOs, all are feeling the pinch.","As the US dollar weakens, Nearshore service providers are feeling the squeeze. With regional currencies rising against the greenback, many of them face the prospect of lower income or significant losses on contracts they signed with their American clients. “Yes, we have also been getting more pushback on pricing lately,” acknowledged Jeremy Stryer, co-founder of Holadev, a Queretaro, Mexico-based software development firm, most of whose clients are startups in the United States. “The constant exchange rate swings make it tough to predict pricing and revenue,” Stryer added. Mexico stands on shaky financial ground, more than any other country in the region. With exports accounting for 40% of its GDP—80% bound for the U.S. — a weakening dollar threatens to derail its dream of becoming the “China next door” for global manufacturing. After rising to new highs immediately after the election of President Donald Trump, the U.S. Dollar Index began to slide earlier this month. Already, the greenback has dropped nearly 5% from its 2025 highs. Analysts expect it to decline further in the coming months. Surprisingly, Latin American currencies had begun to strengthen even before the Dollar Index started sputtering. Argentina’s peso has surged by 40% in recent months, transforming the South American country from the cheapest destination in dollar terms to the most expensive in the region. Today, for many Argentines, living abroad now costs less than staying at home. The Mexican peso has appreciated nearly 5% against the greenback this year. Remarkably, the peso is rising even as the US imposes 25% tariffs on imports. The Brazilian real, meanwhile, has inched up by just 1.5% against the US dollar, largely influenced by high interest rates. One of the world’s top-performing currencies this year is the Colombian peso , which has surged 7.36%. The Peruvian sol has also made gains, appreciating 2.12% against the dollar, securing its place as the sixth-best-performing currency in the region. “It has been pretty crazy with respect to local currency fluctuations versus the U.S. dollar,” says Casey Halloran , CEO & Co-Founder of Costa Rican Vacations . “We are all grappling with this new reality and attempting to plan for continued shockwaves,” Halloran added. The declining US dollar “has indeed sparked concern among businesses relying on nearshoring models,” said Christian Corcino , founder and chairman at Intellisys D Corp , a nearshore IT services provider based in the Dominican Republic. But Corcino’s firm has yet to feel its ill effects. That’s largely because, as Corcino explains, the Dominican Republic’s peso has historically been closely tied to the dollar. “As the dollar’s value decreases, the Dominican peso tends to mirror that movement, so the impact on operational costs and competitiveness remains relatively neutral. Consequently, our own business, which employs personnel exclusively in the Dominican Republic, has seen minimal effect from the dollar’s recent decline.” Weak Dollar and Wage Growth Corcino noted that rising minimum wages, coupled with the decline in the USD, might prompt companies to adjust pricing or optimize resources to maintain profitability. He added that an increase in overall operational expenses for IT and BPO providers is a natural consequence of these economic shifts. In January, Costa Rica raised wages by 2.37%. Mexico implemented a 12% increase in its general minimum wage this year, while Brazil hiked it by 3.23%. Colombia’s minimum wage has nearly doubled in less than a decade. In February, Argentina enacted a 20% wage hike to help workers cope with soaring inflation. The Dominican Republic followed suit, making history with its own 20% wage increase. However, the increase in minimum wages is less likely to have a significant impact on IT workers. “For our organization, however, this shift has been less significant. Our employees — primarily software developers — already earn salaries well above the minimum wage, meaning the direct impact on payroll expenses is limited,” Corcino added. “Going forward, service providers across the region can navigate higher labor costs by focusing on specialized skill sets, improving efficiency, and delivering higher-value services, ensuring that any wage increases are balanced by productivity gains and a stronger competitive edge.” Impact on Tourism The impact of the weakened dollar could become evident in the quarterly fiscal reports of nearshore vendors later in April. However, its effects are already apparent in the tourism sector. Costa Rica’s tourism industry has suffered five consecutive months of declining foreign visitors, as the local currency, the colon, surged to historic highs. Before the pandemic, a three-day package cost around US$180 per person . Now, the same package exceeds $400—more than double the previous price. “The Colon vs. USD exchange rate has been detrimental to tourism since late 2022, when the USD to Colon rate fell from a peak of 670 to 500 (-25%),” Halloran added. By March 15, the colon had reached an all-time high of 485 per USD, as the international airports across the country showed a deep dip in foreign arrivals. “It has remained at that 500 level today, and multiple industries — agriculture, nearshoring, tourism, real estate, medical tourism, shipping — are highly concerned that a further decline in the USD’s value could lead to a loss of competitiveness,” Halloran said. Argentina Becomes Ever More Expensive President Javier Milei devalued Argentina’s currency by 54% shortly after taking office. A year later, it rebounded as the so-called “superpeso.” Meanwhile, the minimum wage jumped from 156,000 pesos at the start of 2024 to 272,000 pesos today — a 76% increase in nominal terms. In dollar value, it rose from $157 to $228. According to a report from online job platform Bumeran , the average salary sought in Argentina now stands at $1,234, surpassing the regional average. Just a year ago, it ranked among the lowest in Latin America. The stronger peso has reshaped tourism patterns. Fewer foreign tourists are visiting Argentina, while more Argentines are opting for trips abroad. In 2024, foreign tourist arrivals dropped by 8.4% to 6.2 million visitors, while the number of Argentine travelers heading overseas surged by 11.8%, reaching 8.3 million, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INDEC).

In March alone, 10,400 IT jobs were cut, according to a new report from Janco Associates . This downturn is part of a prolonged contraction. Over the past three fiscal quarters, IT sector employment has shrunk consistently, with a total of more than 200,000 jobs lost in the past two years. In the last 13 months alone, the cumulative job loss stands at 155,100, with current unemployment estimates for IT professionals ranging from 133,000 to 148,000. The report highlights AI and large language models as key drivers of workforce reductions, particularly impacting IT roles in clerical support, telecommunications, and customer service. These technologies are also curbing the creation of entry-level jobs. Hiring remains cautious, especially among small and mid-sized firms, while larger corporations prioritize cost-cutting and AI-led productivity. The demand for IT professionals is now skewed toward specialists in AI, cybersecurity, internet processing, and emerging technologies. However, experienced developers focused on legacy systems face dwindling prospects. Janco reports that terminations have exceeded new hires for three consecutive quarters. The unemployment rate for IT professionals peaked at 5.7% in January before easing to 5% in March.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/caribbean-education-a-colonial-era-system-is-not-cutting-it/,Caribbean Education: A Colonial-Era System is Not Cutting It - Nearshore Americas,2025-03-27T17:48:46+00:00,"The Caribbean’s education system is in crisis, with recent studies showing most students struggle with mathematics, a fundamental skill in the modern world.","The Caribbean’s education system is in crisis, with recent studies showing a large majority of students struggling with mathematics, a fundamental skill in the modern world. “We are confronting a crisis … in education,” warned Lilia Burunciuc, the World Bank’s country director for the Caribbean, during a recent webinar. Unless urgent action is taken, Burunciuc said, the region’s economic future could be at risk. In the 2024 Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate exams, only 4.9% of students passed five or more subjects, including Mathematics and English . Even more concerning, just 36% passed Mathematics. But intelligence is not the problem. Caribbean students are just as capable as their global counterparts. The real issues, according to Victoria Levin, a senior economist in the World Bank’s education global practice, are outdated teaching methods and deep-rooted inequalities in educational access. Colonial Legacy Still Shapes Education The education system, shaped by colonial-era practices, still favors the privileged. Under colonial rule, elite schools were reserved for wealthy students. Today, private schools continue the tradition through selective entrance exams, a “sorting mechanism” as Levin describes it. In Trinidad and Tobago, for example, the Secondary Entrance Assessment (SEA) is a high-stakes exam for 11- to 13-year-olds seeking entry into public secondary schools. It is essentially a modern version of the British-era College Exhibition Examination, originally designed to limit access to education. SEA heavily tests students in Mathematics and Creative Writing, and only top scorers secure places in the best schools. And this isn’t unique to Trinidad — Barbados, Jamaica, and other Caribbean nations follow similar models. Even after rigorous selection, less than 80% of students pass English, and fewer than half succeed in Mathematics, Levin added. Higher Education Thrives, Yet Early Education Suffers Surprisingly, the Caribbean spends more on college education than on primary schooling. “Higher education, especially through the University of the West Indies system, has made considerable improvements over the past decade,” said Scott MacDonald, a fellow at the Caribbean Policy Consortium , in a conversation with Nearshore Americas. From his experience, graduates from these institutions are competent and well-prepared. However, many struggle due to weak foundational education. For the region to advance, MacDonald insists, reform is essential. “Competition is global,” he warns. Without fixing the education system, the Caribbean risks falling further behind. MacDonald, an expert in Caribbean economic issues, has taught political science in several institutions and authored books on the region’s development challenges. Teachers Are Leaving in Large Numbers For decades, the Caribbean has been losing teachers to better-paying countries . Jamaica alone lost 10% of its teacher workforce in just three years. In 2022, 1,538 teachers left in just nine months. Some aren’t just leaving the country — they’re leaving the profession altogether. “Some (teachers) are not migrating but leaving the profession (altogether) because they are overworked, underpaid, and undervalued,” said Dr. Garth Anderson, head of the Caribbean Teachers’ Union, at a 2023 conference in Barbados . Even newly qualified teachers in the UK, Canada, and the U.S. earn two to three times more than those in Jamaica, St. Lucia, Suriname and Trinidad, according to a University of the West Indies study. Beyond low wages, many Caribbean nations lack clear teacher recruitment and training standards. A World Bank and OECS study found that in many countries, teachers don’t receive full training until nearly a decade into their careers. The entry requirements are shockingly low. In Grenada, for example, a person can become a teacher with just five subject passes. Until 2019, new teachers received only a two-week induction program—their only formal preparation before taking charge of a classroom. Guyana’s Smart Classrooms: A Model for Change While most of the Caribbean struggles with outdated education systems, one country is taking a bold step forward. Guyana, fueled by its booming oil wealth, is embracing the future. In 2021, with support from the World Bank, Guyana introduced smart classrooms — equipping schools with smartboards, projectors, and laptops. The impact has been remarkable. At Kuru Kururu Primary School, 38 kilometers south of Georgetown, attendance has improved dramatically. “The difference is clear — students are more engaged than ever,” the head teacher told the World Bank. Teachers, too, are benefiting. With digital tools, they can refine their teaching methods and continuously improve. Before, lessons relied on static charts and worksheets. Thanks to the interactive way of learning, studying maths has become a joyful experience for students. Encouraged by this success, Guyana announced a $676 million investment in late 2024 to expand smart classrooms nationwide.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/h1b-visa-restirctions-could-boost-nearshoring/,H1-B Visa Restrictions Likely to Boost Nearshore - Nearshore Americas,2025-04-03T16:00:23+00:00,"Tech giants, including Microsoft, Google and Amazon, warned H1-B Visa employees this week against leaving the country for fear of not being allowed back in, the latest twist in an ongoing conversation surrounding immigration in America. As anxiety rises among U.S. visa holders amid rising deportations and scrutiny, some Nearshore industry experts are saying the","Tech giants, including Microsoft, Google and Amazon, warned H1-B Visa employees this week against leaving the country for fear of not being allowed back in, the latest twist in an ongoing conversation surrounding immigration in America. As anxiety rises among U.S. visa holders amid rising deportations and scrutiny, some Nearshore industry experts are saying the dynamic could be beneficial to companies aligned with talent acquisition in Latin America. The H1-B Visa program brings more than 100,000 highly educated foreigners to the U.S. each year for jobs that pay at least $60,000 per year. Typically, about 500,000 to 600,000 H1-B Visa holders are on American soil at any one time, about 70% of which are Indian nationals. This week, Indian H1-B workers voiced concerns to The Washington Post about the changes in immigration policy, with one noting the recent revocation of birthright citizenship, meaning the U.S.-born children of visa holders are at risk of becoming stateless upon birth. The Trump administration has not been consistent with its messaging on H1-B Visas, which was most recently highlighted during a public disagreement between a cohort of Trump supporters and Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy in December. Musk and Ramaswamy advocated against restricting H1-B Visas as had been done during Trump’s first term . Trump ultimately decided to keep his hands off the H1-B program while signing a slew of executive orders in January that, in part, ordered “enhanced vetting” for visa applicants and those already in the country. With deportations skyrocketing and continued anti-immigration rhetoric emitting from the White House, experts are warning about the potential business implications that could arise from the increased scrutiny placed on immigration. Call to Elevate Service Amid the ever-changing rhetoric and heightened anxiety among visa holders, the situation may provide an opportunity for companies aligned with the nearshoring industry. “It’s an interesting moment for our market,” said Pablo Baldomá Jones, co-founder and chief executive officer of Alto , a global software engineering firm. “I would describe it as a cocktail of increasing talent predisposition toward remote work combined with this reduction in these visas.” Jones’ business focuses on connecting talent from Latin America to the U.S. He said if visa intake is reduced, salaries in America will likely rise, which will cause more opportunity and competition in the nearshore market. “It’s worth noting that nearshore companies present an alternative to H1-B talent, though this pushes providers to elevate their service standards to remain competitive. We’ve particularly noticed that some companies become more hesitant to work with nearshore providers when compliance requirements are stricter, such as in banking. And this drives all LatAm providers to raise the bar regarding security standards.” Heading for Brighter Pastures Pablo Miller, chief executive officer of Remoti , a platform specializing in remote talent solutions in Latin America, echoed Jones’ comments on immigration restrictions bringing opportunity to the nearshore industry, and also said it could cause a new influx of talent relocating to Latin American countries. A dual citizen of Britain and Colombia, Miller said there is a growing trend of Indian tech workers, who traditionally head for Silicon Valley, relocating to Colombia due to new restrictions and concerns. “When I lived in Colombia years ago, I didn’t see many Indians around, but now when you go there, just walking around the shopping center, it’s noticeable that these tech workers are relocating. There’s a growing number of Indian expats.” Miller is looking to the upcoming 2026 presidential election in Colombia as a key decider in how the country manages to take advantage of its business opportunities in the future. Incumbent Gustavo Petro is term-limited, and Miller said whichever candidate shows the most interest in bringing foreign dollars into the country is likely to win the election. “Who doesn’t want foreign dollars coming into Colombia? Who doesn’t want more jobs in Colombia? But, most importantly, who doesn’t want Silicon Valley knowledge coming into Colombia?” he said. “These companies may not necessarily be building in Colombia, but they’re going to be made in Colombia.” Riding the Wave of Momentum Jens Gould, Founder and CEO of Amalga Group , said he has seen some anecdotal evidence of overseas talent moving to Latin America, but hasn’t witnessed first-hand any major shift in the nationality of workers in the nearshoring industry. Nevertheless, if more quantifiable immigration restrictions were to occur, he also believes it could boost both the nearshore industry and Latin American countries overall. “In terms of any (potential) immigration policy in the U.S., if they restrict in any way, I actually think that could lead to more interest in services for nearshore companies. … If it’s harder to bring the world’s best talent to the U.S., the companies are still going to need that talent. They’re going to look elsewhere for it, and given the nearshore value proposition that we all know of — the time zone, the cultural affinity, the proximity — it’s the most logical place.” Gould said recent market factors have given a boost to nearshoring, including a drop in near-term interest rates that has spurred investment in the region. The Mexican government, which has focused heavily on supporting the manufacturing industry, and other regional governments could do more to support the potential for a nearshoring boom, he feels. “You see some activity, some investment, in education, particularly tech and engineering, some movement on tax incentives, development of tech hubs, but it’s not nearly enough. Mexico could do a lot more to incentivize this … there’s been a real increase in interest in Mexico’s tech talent, and you haven’t seen the government jump in and do that much.” Comment Name *  Email *  Website   Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.    Tim—spot on analysis. What’s happening around H1-B policy isn’t a side issue—it’s accelerating a deeper reconfiguration of how U.S. companies access global talent. And yes, Latin America is the next frontier—but we must be honest about the readiness gap. Most current SaaS platforms, even the newer EOR apps, don’t go far enough. They weren’t built to operate as full-stack, self-learning systems. The market now demands automation that connects sourcing, vetting, onboarding, compliance, and ongoing performance in one integrated loop. Anything less is just duct tape. The stakes are rising fast—literally. Salaries for engineers in LATAM are climbing, and vendors running outdated delivery models are struggling to hold onto clients. Why? Their rates are ballooning, but their value delivery hasn’t evolved. What we need now is an industry reset. Vendors need to run lean, with high-efficiency operations, less internal bloat, and transparent flat rates that give accounts room to grow without blowing up the client’s long-term budget. We laid this out in our research years ago, which unexpectedly became the first formal science papers focused on Nearshore IT Staff Augmentation. The takeaway is even more urgent now: the future belongs to platforms that can deliver velocity, accuracy, and transparency by design—not as a patch. —Lonnie McRorey When Debra Fraser first came to Jamaica from Canada in 2000 on a church mission trip, she never imagined she’d play a growing role in the Caribbean’s fast-growing business process outsourcing industry.

One of the suspects, Tyrone Rose, along with an unidentified co-worker, exploited their privileged system access to manipulate a loophole in StubHub’s platform, according to a complaint filed with a criminal court in Queens, New York. The American ticket marketplace had a reseller contract with Sutherland, granting its employees access to specific backend functions. Rose and his accomplice capitalized on this access to resell nearly 1,000 tickets for high-profile events, including Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour , Adele and Ed Sheeran concerts, NBA games, and the U.S. Open Tennis Championships. StubHub generates a unique URL for each ticket purchase, allowing buyers to download their tickets. Rose and his co-worker infiltrated a restricted part of the system where ticket orders were stored. They then altered the email addresses linked to these orders, redirecting the ticket download links to their associates instead of the legitimate buyers. Between June 2022 and July 2023, they stole 993 tickets across 350 orders, with the majority coming from Swift’s Eras Tour, thanks to its record-breaking demand. When StubHub uncovered the fraud, it swiftly terminated its contract with Sutherland and alerted law enforcement. New York police have arrested Tyrone Rose and Shamara Simmons, while a third suspect remains on the run. A fourth accomplice died before facing charges. Rose and Simmons are now confronting serious charges, including grand larceny, computer tampering, and conspiracy, which could result in prison sentences ranging from 3 to 15 years. Could it be Avoided? The case has ignited major concerns about security oversight at Sutherland, leaving the global BPO firm scrambling to contain the fallout. Jared Koll, a CX advisor based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, believes Sutherland could have averted the incident had it implemented “AI-anomaly solutions.” These tools monitor agents’ behavior and flag high-risk actions, such as accessing unauthorized databases. “Further, geo-fencing and device security could have stopped these agents from accessing unauthorized systems in the first place, through permissions and device access controls.” After discovering the fraud, StubHub promptly issued a press release and announced the contract termination. However, Sutherland has remained silent, neither making a public statement nor responding to Nearshore Americas’ email inquiry. “We don’t know the internal steps SGS is taking, but if we were advising them, we’d expect a full post-mortem and an RFP process for upgraded security infrastructure,” Koll said when asked about potential next steps. “If you are a Jamaica-based BPO that is NOT SGS, you should launch a full messaging push, publicly highlighting the compliance improvements you’ve made since 2024.” Jamaica’s Reaction According to Radio Jamaica, Wayne Sinclair, president of the Global Services Association of Jamaica (GSAJ), said the incident has cast a long shadow over Jamaica’s BPO industry. This is partly because the accused are Jamaican nationals who likely exploited the trust Sutherland Global placed in them. Sinclair called for hefty penalties on employees who engage in such crimes. “Such (punishments) will act as a real deterrent to people who may be thinking about doing this because I think right now there’s a sense that it’s worth the risk.” However, the GSAJ President emphasized that all BPOs have enforced stringent security protocols to safeguard client data. He stressed that this breach occurred due to a betrayal of trust by employees. “Our BPOs have strong, independent relationships with clients, reinforced by frequent client visits to our locations and rigorous inspections of our physical and IT security protocols and processes.” “The confidence of our collective client base in our service is rooted in these trusted personal relationships.” News Editor for Nearshore Americas, Narayan Ammachchi is a career journalist with a decade of experience in politics and international business.

Last week, the U.S. revoked his visa. The state department told NPR visa records are confidential and cannot be discussed publicly. Arias said workers at the U.S. embassy in Costa Rica informed him the action had been taken over his close ties to the Chinese government. Arias has been critical of U.S. President Donald Trump and earlier this year compared him to a “Roman emperor.” The Nobel Laureate believes those comments may have led to the decision to revoke his visa. A Shift in Policy Signalling to Arias that he is no longer welcome in the U.S. is the most high-profile example of a noticeable shift in policy from the Trump administration. Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a memo to diplomats asking them to search through the social media accounts of visa applicants. This follows an executive order signed by Trump that jump-started an effort to deport individuals from the country who have “hostile attitudes” toward American values. Trump has also inked an order to reduce antisemitism that has been used to justify the deportation of students protesting against Israel’s military actions in Gaza. On Thursday, Inside Higher Ed reported the state department has modified or revoked more than 600 student visas since the order was signed. Populism in LatAm The left wing in Latin America has historically opposed the influence exerted by the United States in the region. Arias’ goal for peace in 1986 was not helped by the U.S. funding of the right-wing Contra rebels that were causing instability in Nicaragua. After years of political dominance, the left capitulated when the Conservative Wave hit Latin America about 10 years ago, bringing an influx of right-wing leadership to numerous countries. But the branding, this time, was not quite the same as the conservative administrations of years past. Raquel Chanto, a Costa Rican political scientist and Oxford University Ph.D. candidate, cited a global decline in trust as being responsible for the rise of populist leaders in an interview with Yoriko Yasukawa, vice president of the Foundation for Global Governance and Sustainability. “Trust is the philosopher’s stone of political systems, something you can translate into results through legitimacy, buy-in and willingness to cooperate and engage in political agreements,” Chanto said. “Overall, people trust systems that they believe are fair, consistent, open and responsive; where they feel included and heard, and their needs are addressed. That is to say that citizens trust the good government.” Rhetoric vs. Reality Teamstation AI CEO and Co-Founder Lonnie McRorey has lived in Mexico for nine years while operating his nearshore staffing system company. “I think more professionals are trying to stay here — they’re not so eager to go to the U.S.,” he said. “But, look, the dollar still has a very powerful way. There are people here willing to risk everything in their lives to make $300.” McRorey said that the disparity among Mexican nationals creates an interesting dynamic, with the ability for many to have a quality of life at or surpassing what the U.S. offers while still seeing abject poverty and citizens trying to escape the country. “There’s high taxes, no access to health care,” he said of the U.S. “Believe it or not, quality of life in LatAm is better than in the U.S. in many ways.” Latin American reliance on economic support from the United States has waned in recent years as China begins to exert influence in the region. Arias, while Costa Rica’s president, established diplomatic relations with China in 2007. The BRICS economic bloc, originally a partnership between Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, announced in January it was adding nine “partner” nations, which included Bolivia. Additionally, BRICS says it has received interest from Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Uruguay and Venezuela to join the partnership. ‘Sympathy for the Devil’ The U.S. military is taking notice. A report released by the Army-operated Foreign Military Studies Office states that there is an increase in the number of Latin American countries looking to develop significant overseas relations . “This development signals that dictatorships in Latin America see the BRICS grouping as an economic and political lifeline amid difficult economic and diplomatic moments. Relatedly, the inclusion of a greater number of Latin American countries in BRICS will bring China and Russia further into the Western hemisphere, where both have been increasing their influence of late,” the report states. Similarly, a report issued by Irene Mia, a senior fellow for Latin America at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the U.S. should be wary of celebrating its near-term policy victories , such as tackling drug trafficking, before it fully realizes some of the long-term effects its rhetoric toward Latin America may bring. “Without concrete measures to support Latin America’s economic growth and diversification, and to bolster its Democratic institutions, China will remain a dominant economic force in the region,” Mia wrote. “Additionally, trade tariffs and deportations of undocumented migrants to their countries of origin — particularly through the economic blow of lost remittances — will wreak havoc on Latin American economies, making China’s trade and investment even more attractive.” Comment Name *  Email *  Website   Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

These institutions are attracting learners, not just with traditional language instruction, but by offering immersive cultural experiences, extracurricular programs, and career-focused training. Leading the trend are schools like Maximo Nivel, with campuses in Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Peru; Academia Buenos Aires in Argentina; and several prominent institutions in Colombia. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, demand for English language learning doubled. Although interest declined somewhat in the following years, it remains strongly linked to employment opportunities, prompting renewed investment in language education across the region. According to Kumon’s language program operators, only about 5% of Latin America’s population speaks English — a statistic they highlighted two years ago in Chilean media as a major barrier to accessing better job prospects. In contrast, nearly 35% of available jobs require English proficiency . In countries like Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, employment is the second most common motivation for learning English, underscoring its role in professional growth and upward mobility. Increasingly, individuals are turning to private language schools and online platforms, beyond formal education systems, to build the language skills necessary for career advancement.

This resurgence delivered a powerful boost to local economies and employment, cementing tourism’s role as a vital economic engine for the region. According to the Caribbean Tourism Organisation (CTO), the majority of visitors came from traditional source markets — the United States, Canada, and Europe. Leading the pack were American travelers, with 16.8 million arrivals, up 3.5% from 2023 and nearly 8% higher than in 2019. Americans alone made up almost half of all international tourists to the Caribbean. Canada followed with 3.3 million visitors, a 4% rise from the previous year, though still slightly below its 2019 benchmark. Meanwhile, European tourism showed more modest momentum. Visitor numbers inched up 1.4%, totaling 5.3 million. Analysts attribute the sluggish pace to volatile exchange rates , rising airfare costs and persistent economic headwinds in parts of Europe. Cruise tourism also made waves in 2024. Roughly 33.7 million passengers visited the region via cruise ships — a 10.3% jump from the prior year — driven by the return of major cruise operators and pent-up global demand. Famed for its island charm, vibrant culture and wide-ranging attractions, the Caribbean remains a premier destination worldwide. However, experts caution that 2025 may bring slower growth, as economic uncertainty and geopolitical friction weigh on international travel demand.

That is why he founded Vetalia 18 months ago, together with his team formed by Marion Benítez Landa, CGO, Antonio R. Remolina, Chief Medical Officer and Fernando Estrada, COO. The startup has managed to build an innovative and standardized animal health ecosystem with the help of technology. “The consumer is increasingly demanding with the quality of veterinary services and Vetalia is a response to this,” Maria Gutierrez shared to Contxto. “We saw a huge opportunity in improving customer care and service, in addition to having understood the pain-points of operating a network of hospitals, providing improvements in the animal health ecosystem in general, thus solving problems for ourselves, which we then scaled for other companies,” she added. In a nutshell, Vetalia is an animal health ecosystem (a B2C business) and provides solutions to other animal health companies (through a B2B business). It currently has a portfolio of more than 15,000 clients, with an average recurrence of 5 visits per year. Within the veterinary clinics vertical, it offers preventive services, surgeries, emergencies and specialties. It also has a business sales vertical where it offers diverse solutions to more veterinarians. Gutierrez boasted that from December 2023 to December 2024 they had a revenue growth of 400%, so that by 2025 they are looking to close with triple-digit growth. For now, the company has a portfolio of 10 hospitals of its own, 5 veterinary companies in partnership and two additional verticals of services to the industry. By the end of 2025, the goal is to close with 16 owned clinics and 10 integrated veterinary assets.  Vetalia has managed to scale with control and sustainability, achieving that its hospitals reach the operating break-even point on average in the fourth month of operation. They currently have a presence in Mexico City, State of Mexico and Monterrey. “Our plan is to reach the main cities in the country and expand there,” he said. To finance growth, the company not only leverages its own cash flow, but also the Series A raised in 2023, in which it raised 10 million dollars from IGZUS, a private equity fund, and strategic investors. According to Storecheck , a market data analytics firm, the pet care industry will reach $90.4 billion by 2025, growing at 4.5% annually. This industry still has the potential to transform through technology. Another example of this is Petycard, a Mexican startup that offers a digital loyalty card that connects pet lovers with businesses that offer products and services, from veterinarians to pet-friendly restaurants. Jorge Kuri, founder of Petycard, said that in Mexico around 70% have a pet and are more concerned than before about their care. At Vetalia, technology is a central asset, said Gutiérrez. “We use it both to streamline our operations and reduce costs, which translates into a benefit for users, and to provide a customer service platform that also drives our growth and ability to attract and retain customers.” For Gutiérrez, the main problem that Vetalia solves is customer service. The CEO explained that with technology, through the platform, she gives her clients the opportunity to schedule appointments, have centralized clinical records and follow up on their pets, which creates a much more complete experience. On the other hand, Vetalia is developing technology to offer various solutions to more veterinarians and thus consolidate its B2B vertical. “Technology has been a great ally to solve operational inefficiencies,” concluded the entrepreneur.

In the scientific landscape, where the race for technological innovation is fought mainly between global economic powers, a story emerges from Latin America that seeks to highlight the talent and capabilities available in the region. It is the startup Fastfold, which emerges as an exceptional case in the region: a platform that uses AI to accelerate scientific discovery and democratize research in molecular biology. Founded by Julio Castellanos and Esteban Maya, this company is redefining how protein engineering is approached, a critical field for the development of drugs, resilient crops and innovative therapies. What is most remarkable is that they are doing it from a region that has historically faced economic and technological barriers to compete in global science. In an interview with Contxto, Esteban Maya, CTO of the company, explains their development philosophy: “We have built from scratch, to a functional product and launched in the market with founders’ own money (Bootstrap), and some credits from cloud providers”. This bootstrap approach demonstrates that it is possible to create world-class technology even with limited resources. In addition to starting with little capital, Fastfold has managed to overcome specific obstacles to developing cutting-edge technology in the region, as CEO Julio Castellanos explains: “One of the main challenges in Latin America is the limited access to accelerated computing, due to the high cost of GPUs such as Nvidia’s and the high prices of large-scale cloud”. While startup loans are available, priority is usually given to U.S. companies, leaving those in the region with restricted access. On the other hand, Castellanos comments that “the ecosystem is not yet well articulated to adopt AI solutions with a scientific approach. Most initiatives are focused on commercial applications, while scientific research and publication – which is our focus – receives little institutional support”. However, this reality has not deterred the team, which has adopted an ingenious approach to circumvent these limitations. Fastfold’s platform is achieving what many considered impossible: matching the accuracy of traditional protein research methods. As Castellanos details, “Fastfold offers optimized computation and models such as AlphaFold that not only maintain accuracy comparable to experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography, but also dramatic improvements in speed and cost.” AlphaFold, for example, demonstrated unprecedented performance in the international CASP14 (Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction) competition, which evaluates accuracy in protein structure prediction. “The main metric used by CASP is the Global Distance Test (GDT), which ranges from 0 to 100. Simply put, it can be understood as the percentage of amino acid residues whose predicted position falls within a distance threshold with respect to the actual position,” explains Julio Castellanos. “In CASP14, AlphaFold achieved an average score of 92.4 GDT across all targets, with an average error (RMSD) of approximately 1.6 Ångstroms, i.e., comparable to the width of an atom. Even in the most challenging cases of free modeling, it obtained an average score of 87.0 GDT, far outperforming other methods,” explains Julio Castellanos. For Fastfold’s founders, their initiative transcends the commercial sphere. Esteban Maya says that “artificial intelligence represents a unique opportunity for Latin America to move towards true technological sovereignty, allowing the region not only to consume technology, but also to develop and export it”. This philosophy is materialized in concrete applications that could transform key sectors of the regional economy. In the field of health, the platform could accelerate the development of vaccines and drugs. In agriculture, it offers tools to optimize crops that are resistant to climate change. And in education, it democratizes access to advanced research tools. On future plans, Maya shares a measured strategy: “We want to make some key partnerships, publish some papers and have some revenue, thus demonstrating that with a small team and without requiring large sums of capital, we can achieve a lot”. This approach reflects a deep understanding of the regional investment ecosystem, which, as Maya points out, needs to evolve: “Venture capital should focus on deeptech, climatech, biotech and HealthTech products, which are the sectors that need large amounts of capital to start their projects and validate themselves”. Fastfold represents more than a business success; it is a model of how Latin America can overcome structural limitations to compete in global science. As Castellanos summarizes: “Our focus is on doing science with global impact, but accessible, adapted to a market that is still in the process of consolidation to support deep innovation”. In a world where biotechnology will be key to solving the great challenges of humanity, initiatives such as Fastfold position Latin America as a relevant player in this scientific revolution. Its history shows that with talent, vision and perseverance, the region can not only participate, but lead in the frontier of knowledge. Your email address will not be published.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/rumors-vs-reality-the-real-cause-of-guyanas-bpo-woes/,Rumors vs. Reality: The Real Cause of Guyana’s BPO Woes - Nearshore Americas,2025-04-22T14:25:29+00:00,The closure of a facility operated by French BPO giant Teleperformance in Guyana has ignited a wave of speculation.,"The closure of a facility operated by French BPO giant Teleperformance (TP) in Guyana has ignited a wave of speculation. Whispers have grown so loud that some media outlets are now claiming the entire BPO sector in the Caribbean nation is teetering on the edge of collapse . The shuttered center, located at the busy intersection of Robb and Camp streets in Georgetown, didn’t go dark overnight. Some reports suggest that chronic absenteeism among employees was the main trigger. Others point to the possible loss of critical client contracts as another contributing factor. Guyana’s Vice President Dr. Bharrat Jagdeo, speaking to Guyana Times , blamed the closure on what he described as serious issues with punctuality and work ethic. “A lot of people apparently are finding jobs elsewhere, so a lot are leaving or some are showing up late,” he said. “They (Teleperformance) operate in a very competitive sector and they have clients abroad and if nobody is there, you can’t keep the quality of the service up,” he added. Yet, the narrative that Teleperformance is scaling down its presence in Guyana was firmly challenged by Peter Ramsaroop, chief investment officer at GO-INVEST, the country’s investment promotion agency. He insisted the company isn’t pulling out, but upgrading. “It’s worth noting that they recently rented a brand new building in Georgetown , around 60,000 square feet, plus another 30,000 square feet. That came with a 10-year lease. So, I’m not sure where the message that they’re ‘downsizing’ is coming from,” he wondered. Nearshore Americas contacted TP’s public relations officer, but she did not reply within a week of being contacted. Oil Companies Poaching BPO Staff? Just weeks ago, a group of BPO executives met with Finance Minister Dr. Ashni Singh, seeking the government’s help with staffing and retention challenges. Soon, several news outlets began pointing fingers at the oil sector. Flush with revenue, the argument went, oil companies are luring away skilled workers from BPOs. And it’s easy to see why this theory has gained traction — Guyana’s oil boom is reshaping its economic landscape. Between 2022 and 2024, the economy surged, averaging a staggering 47% annual GDP growth. Oil exports and heavy infrastructure investments were the engines behind that momentum. Looking ahead, the International Monetary Fund forecasts another strong year in 2025. Overall GDP is expected to rise by 10%, with the non-oil sector projected to grow by 13%. It’s a sign that Guyana’s growth is beginning to spread across other industries. However, the claim that oil firms are poaching BPO staff doesn’t quite hold up under scrutiny. “If you’re working in a call center, you wouldn’t necessarily be looking to join an oil company, so that’s not really true,” Ramsaroop said. Still, rumors often travel faster than facts. The recent exit of Jamaican BPO company Itel from Guyana has only amplified the noise, giving critics more reason to question the sector’s health. Ramsaroop did admit that Guyana is grappling with a shortage of skilled talent . But he quickly added that such shortages are a hallmark of every fast-growing economies around the globe. When asked what the government is doing to improve the human capital, he said: “We’re offering a lot of technical training. We’ve recently set up several major technical institutes across the country. Over the last four and a half years, we’ve awarded more than 40,000 scholarships to young people pursuing bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD degrees.” “In addition, we’ve been working closely with the BPO industry. If they require pre-employment training—for example, for high school graduates entering the workforce — the government supports those efforts.” Georgetown’s Retention Challenge It is, however, true that retention is one of the biggest hurdles for BPOs in Georgetown. But that’s not the case across the board — call centers outside the city are reportedly thriving. With more people relocating to outlying areas, the daily commute into Georgetown has become challenging. Ramsaroop explained that for many workers, long commutes involving multiple bus rides aren’t sustainable. The choice becomes obvious when a job opportunity pops up closer to home. He emphasized that companies must rethink how they support their workforce in this new environment. “The BPOs need to come up with strategies to retain their employees, offering transportation for some far-flung workers,” he added. “Remember, the issue is mainly in Georgetown. All the other call centers outside of Georgetown are doing extremely well.” News Editor for Nearshore Americas, Narayan Ammachchi is a career journalist with a decade of experience in politics and international business.

With the funds raised, the startup plans to expand its services nationwide. “We are going to expand our national coverage, improve our document processing and business registration products, and continue building a more secure, fast and reliable digital identity for all of Mexico,” said Villa. Additionally, the capital injection will allow them to boost their operations and accelerate the development of their specialized identity verification platform for individuals and businesses. “This additional round allows us to accelerate what we have already been building state-of-the-art technology to validate people and companies in less than 5 minutes,” added Villa.  The round comes at a time when venture capital investment in Mexico fell more than 90% in January, according to TTR Data. Nufi’s case shows that it is possible to raise capital when executed with focus and results. While many startups face barriers, the company’s claim that it is solving a real problem with technology that already works is still the best calling card. “At GPCompas we invest in solutions with tangible impact. Nufi solves a challenge faced by many industries, and it does so with technology that is already proven. Even our allied companies have integrated its solution,” emphasized Braulio Arsuaga, founder of GPCompas. For now, Nufi operates exclusively in Mexico, where it has consolidated its client base in different industries, such as human resources, real estate, supplier registration and fintech, which use the service to find out if a person is granted credit, opens an account or is given a financial product.

However, like many other industries that AI experts had promised would bring transformation, the widespread layoffs have yet to come. The business process outsourcing market has ballooned in growth over the past 15 years, a trend that most analysts predict will continue in the short term. A report by Kimberly Tan, investing partner at Andreessen Horowitz, published this year shows the BPO industry has already surpassed a $300 billion market cap on a global scale and is expected to surpass $525 billion by 2030. But the big question is: How will that increase in market share be accomplished? Artificial intelligence will be part of the process, but the question on many executives’ minds is whether that growth comes from AI replacing or improving paid employees. Jeff Pappas, senior managing director at Newmark, has spent over 25 years working with international BPO operators to find real estate suitable for their needs. He hasn’t seen a drop in the demand for office space. Furthermore, the clients he’s spoken with aren’t anticipating major industry shifts due to the continued advancement of AI technology. “Within BPOs, there’s going to be some areas that are more affected than others,” Pappas said. “But there are certain areas where it’s just not going to affect anything — legal, customer service and sales — those are areas that rely on physical, personal interaction.” What’s the Truth? What isn’t? Finding verified information on how artificial intelligence has changed the landscape of global businesses since the AI boom of 2020 and 2021 can be difficult. Basic research through search engines produces blog posts and information showing artificial intelligence adoption rates as high as 50% among global industries. However, results from trusted sources show much lower market saturation. A report from Goldman Sachs at the conclusion of 2024 suggested that only about 6% of American businesses have implemented some form of artificial intelligence into their operations. Pappas said he believes AI will have an increased effect on the BPO industry in the coming years, but questioned whether or not that means eliminating jobs, or more specifically, in the real estate industry, office space. “In contact centers, typically we’re looking at 50 to 80 square feet per person, while in the legal category, it’s probably 175 square feet per person,” he said. “We have all these different metrics to determine how much space an operation needs. If you use AI, we can do everything you want to do in 72 square feet instead of 80, so there’s an efficiency factor where artificial intelligence can squeeze things a bit more.” Pappas said AI’s beauty is its ability to help business owners find cost savings in previously unexplored areas. “You can’t squeeze blood from a turnip,” he said. “Pay is pay, taxes are taxes, insurance is insurance. But AI can look in other areas to help make adjustments that might be needed.” Bringing in Artificial Quality Critics of the global business process outsourcing industry have referred to its operations as a “race to the bottom,” citing the emphasis clients often put on cost-cutting measures over quality of service. However, that trend may face reversal as artificial intelligence becomes adopted across the industry. Automated quality assurance programs are gaining popularity among BPO operators , who use the software to receive instant employee performance feedback. Other predictive analytics programs have allowed BPOs to forecast when higher call volumes will occur during the week, allowing management to alter staffing schedules as needed. Using these types of AI can increase profits and quality of service while adding little overhead to maintain the momentum. “We’re so people-heavy that AI coming in and changing everything quickly just isn’t very likely,” Pappas said. “Maybe we’ll see some changes, but we need people. And the (BPO operators) I’ve talked to — AI hasn’t really affected them yet.” Comment Name *  Email *  Website   Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.    It’s refreshing to see AI being used not to replace people, but to *support* them—enhancing quality and efficiency without losing the human touch.

Geopolitical friction is already disrupting global supply chains and leaving customer service teams scrambling to manage the fallout.

In","Multinational companies appear to be hitting pause on their future plans amid growing fears of a potential trade war. Geopolitical friction is already disrupting global supply chains and leaving customer service teams scrambling to manage the fallout. This is one of the key discussion areas at next week’s CXOutsourcers ‘Mindshare” Forum , in Munich, Germany. In this context of uncertainty, we sat down with Peter Ryan , founder of Ryan Strategic Advisory, to delve into the current opportunities and challenges shaping the global customer experience (CX) landscape. Ryan is a founding member of CXOutsourcers, which annually hosts the Mindshare Event — an industry gathering focused on assessing the global CX and BPO sectors. Designed specifically for Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) professionals, the forum is geared toward empowering C-suite executives with research and strategic insights to drive business performance. More than 120 CX leaders from across the globe are expected to attend. Below are excerpts from the interview with Peter Ryan. NSAM: What advice would you give to contact center providers who are heavily reliant on U.S. customers, especially now that the geopolitical order has shifted under President Donald Trump? Ryan: First, I’d say — don’t panic. Anyone considering the U.S. market shouldn’t abandon it entirely. Yes, there’s a lot of confusion right now. The next few months are going to be political — shaping the direction of what the U.S. plans to do, and how its trade and tariff policies play out. But at this stage, it’s anyone’s guess. There’s still immense value in the U.S. from an outsourcing perspective. So, I’d tell anyone eyeing the U.S. as a potential market: stay clear-eyed, observe closely, but don’t write it off. NSAM: Contact center providers serving U.S. customers seem to be in serious trouble these days, especially with the dollar index plunging to 99. Anything below 100 could deal a devastating blow to providers that are heavily dependent on U.S. clients. How do you suggest they tackle this crisis? Ryan: Well, there’s a lot of volatility out there. Strategic planning is key. Providers must work with people who understand currency fluctuations and risk management — people who can hedge against currency risk using the right tools. Now, while the dollar has appreciated and other currencies have weakened, that may actually benefit offshore providers. For buyers in the U.S., outsourcing just became cheaper. So, depending on how the currency arbitrage plays out, this could increase the appeal of offshore destinations — making U.S. companies more inclined to spend. NSAM: You once told us that most people still prefer speaking to a human rather than a machine in contact centers. So, AI bots wouldn’t be as successful as we initially expected. But these days, many BPOs are deploying chatbots — and laying off human agents. Do you still hold that view, or should service providers adapt and embrace AI? Ryan: I don’t believe there’s a massive wave of agents losing their jobs due to AI. Our research shows that while there has been some displacement, it’s mostly roles that were bound to be automated anyway — like changing an address, or resetting a password. What we’re really seeing now is AI being used to enable agents, not replace them. Yes, some contact centers are moving toward automation or AI-driven models. But I don’t think we’ll see a full-scale shift — at least not in the near or medium term. Maybe in the long term, depending on how you define that. There’s been a lot of hype over the last two and a half years about what AI can do. But when it comes to generative AI in customer service, the hype hasn’t fully matched the delivery — at least, not yet. NSAM: Stock prices of major voice-based BPO providers have taken a hit in recent months. Investors seem to believe that AI bots will take over the customer service industry. What’s your take on this, as an industry analyst? Ryan: You have to look at what triggered the drop in stock prices. It started when a Scandinavian fintech company announced they were shifting all customer service work to AI bots. Naturally, that spooked the outsourcing market. But interestingly, that same fintech recently reversed its decision — bringing the work back to human agents. Why? Because the AI tech simply wasn’t mature enough to deliver the kind of customer experience they needed. So yes, stock price movements are a concern, and investor expectations are clearly a big part of that. But I think we’re now seeing a rebalancing — a recalibration — of how the market perceives AI’s role in CX. NSAM: We recently met the owner of a contact center firm in India. He suggested that service providers should look for countries where agents can speak multiple languages. That way, they can serve a diverse customer base from a single site. He also said new technologies make it easier to handle different accents. Do you think that’s a useful strategy? Ryan: It’s definitely a valid suggestion. In fact, there are already several multilingual hubs around the world doing exactly that. We also have advanced tools now — from automatic translation to accent neutralization — that make multilingual service much more seamless. But the key thing to understand is: there’s no one-size-fits-all strategy. The right approach depends on the company, the industry it’s in, and the markets it serves. So while multilingual hubs are valuable, companies need to align their CX strategy with their specific business goals and customer demographics. NSAM: Which country do you think is making a significant mark in the CX services sector globally? Ryan: The Philippines is doing a fantastic job — as is India. These two are consistently among the most highly rated and preferred destinations by buyers, according to our research. South Africa and Egypt are also standouts. In Latin America, Mexico is a strong favorite, along with Colombia. And in the Caribbean, Jamaica has always impressed us. I was genuinely pleased with what I saw recently during an event hosted by the Jamaican outsourcing sector. In Central and Eastern Europe, there are great success stories coming out of Albania, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria. So, I wouldn’t say there’s one country that’s head and shoulders above the rest. Instead, what we’re seeing is each country carving out its own niche — finding its sweet spot in the industry. The key is that quality locations are stepping up, refining their game, and striving to deliver the best experiences and outcomes. NSAM: What can these executives expect to learn if they participate in the CXOutsourcers’ event in Munich? Why is it important not to miss it? Ryan: This event is crucial for anyone who wants to understand the future of CX — and how outsourcers must pivot to stay competitive through 2025 and into 2026. We’ll dive into key topics like geopolitical disruption, digital transformation, and emerging technologies. We’ll also explore how outsourcing firms can position themselves as influential players — not just vendors — in their respective ecosystems. Plus, we’ll examine new opportunities in emerging verticals and markets. It’s going to be packed with valuable insights. Any executive who wants to stay ahead of the curve simply shouldn’t miss it.

The capital raised is an extension of its previous funding and included participation from diverse investors such as Acrew Capital, Alter Global, Citi Ventures, Citius, Coatue, Commerce Ventures, DST Global, Endeavor Catalyst, Evolution Ventures, Gaingels, Kaszek Ventures, Monashees, Moore Strategic Ventures, Notable Capital and Picus Capital. In addition to growth funding from General Catalyst’s Customer Value Fund. A significant portion of the capital will be used to scale the commercial team and support efforts to strengthen the company’s presence in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia, according to a statement. Clara’s team currently totals more than 300 people, most of whom are in Mexico, a company spokesperson told Contxto. With the new funding, Clara also has a particular focus on accelerating growth in the mid-market and enterprise segments. Currently with more than 20,000 customers in Latin America and a transaction processed every second, Clara’s ecosystem is designed to automate financial operations with greater efficiency. “This new round of financing will allow us to make the necessary investments to maintain this pace of growth, both today and in the future. In the short term, the CVF funding earmarked for sales and marketing is allowing us to expand our enterprise sales team-including presence in a dozen new cities in the region-and invest in new marketing initiatives,” Gerry Giacoman, CEO of Clara, told Contxto. Clara’s offering – which includes corporate cards, invoice management, vendor payments, international payments and proprietary real-time expense control software – is seeing positive numbers. In a statement Gerry Giacoman Colyer, CEO of Clara, said that in Brazil they reached monthly breakeven at the end of last year, and are close to achieving it also in Mexico as an independent operation. “We have a fully funded business plan, and this raise – with the backing of our investors – allows us to bet more strongly on the opportunity and further accelerate growth. We are investing significantly in artificial intelligence internally and also have open positions in areas such as sales and engineering,” he explained. “Clara is on an accelerated growth trajectory. In fact, we were recognized by the Financial Times as the fastest growing company in Latin America and the second fastest growing company in the entire Americas, based on the presentation of our audited financial statements,” Giacoman said in a written response. Launched in 2021, Clara has been among the fastest-growing Latin American startups. So far it had raised $492 million in debt and venture capital. Just months after its founding by Gerry Giacoman and Diego Garcia, in March 2021 it received a $3.5 million seed round that boosted its startup. Two months later it announced that it closed a $30 million Series A round of funding. In addition to securing a $50 million revolving credit facility. In December 2021 it received a $70 million investment round led by Cotaue, who has invested in tech companies such as Tik Tok, which brought Clara to unicorn status, i.e. a startup with a valuation in excess of $1 billion. In August 2022 Clara disclosed that it obtained a $150 million credit line from Goldman Sachs, in a year in which Latin startups turned to this type of financing due to venture capitalists’ wariness of high interest rates. Even as the venture capital ecosystem slowed, Clara received a large $60 million round in 2023 in a round led by GGV Capital. At the time, from his office in Brasilia, Brazil’s capital, Giacoman, its CEO, told Contxto that “unlike 2021, when we raised three rounds of capitalization quickly, raising in 2023 required much more attention.” The investment was intended to double its presence in Mexico. Also in 2023 Clara moved its headquarters from Mexico to Brazil after obtaining a license from the central bank to operate as a payment institution, which would boost its expansion in that country. Clara told Contxto that Mexico is currently its main market, with Brazil slightly behind. For the time being, the startup – which recently celebrated its fourth anniversary – continues to innovate in its ecosystem. It has just launched a series of AI-powered solutions to simplify the day-to-day life of financial teams, as well as vertical payment solutions such as VCNs – masked, highly configurable virtual card numbers – for the travel industry, and fuel cards for logistics-focused companies.

However, despite its advantages, its adoption is being held back in the region due to obsolete systems, unclear ROI and tools that still do not communicate well with each other. In Latin America, companies face three main barriers to implementing AI in their services. Systems that are difficult to modernize, a shortage of specialized talent and budgetary constraints. These factors show that during 2024, 78% of Latin American executives considered AI as a strategic priority, only 34% had implemented solutions at scale. In response to this challenge, Nisum and AAIC have formed a strategic alliance with the goal of making AI adoption more accessible, faster and safer for companies struggling with technological complexity. The alliance has launched a full-stack AI support system that promises to eliminate that friction, offering support across a broad scope of IT, from cloud modernization to process automation to intelligent IT operations. With industry experts from leading cloud providers, this alliance brings results-driven, enterprise-level expertise. One of the first fruits of this alliance is OpsPilot, an AI-based solution designed for IT teams overburdened by alert management and staffing shortages. The recent partnership announcement comes at a key moment for Latin America, where enthusiasm for artificial intelligence is colliding with complex operational realities. The alliance has launched a comprehensive AI support system, ranging from cloud modernization to process automation and intelligent IT operations. This tool not only promises to reduce incident resolution time by up to 90%, but also automates critical tasks such as running runbooks, managing tickets and collecting evidence, all in a matter of minutes. “Nisum’s tagline, Building Success Together, reflects our deep commitment to empowering customers and partners to achieve their business goals,” said Imtiaz Mohammady, CEO of Nisum. “This partnership with AAIC reinforces that commitment to creating real and measurable impact in the AI and cloud space.” The a partnership is providing AI that rapidly migrates from legacy systems to the modern cloud stack, Nisum’s existing AI toolset will bring solutions such as code migration, automating code refactoring and reducing downtime risk; GenAI-based recommendations to guide application modernization strategies with intelligent suggestions; among others. The companies say it takes strategy, proof of value and a dedicated team that understands the needs of the business to deliver the right tools. To ensure the right solutions get into the right hands, the team offers customized proposals that show measurable ROI and hands-on workshops for AI and cloud readiness. They focus on PoCs that move quickly from proof to impact, and ongoing collaboration that supports long-term growth. Vijay Roy, CEO of AAIC, explains, “Nisum has a strong legacy of driving digital transformation for Fortune 500 companies, and we are bringing AI-first innovation to the table, built on years of research, development and proprietary frameworks. We are excited about what lies ahead.” The two companies will focus on solving problems that businesses face every day and establish a joint commitment to deliver innovative and secure AI solutions that drive long-term success for their customers.

On one hand, it facilitates access to credit for patients who need to cover immediate medical expenses. On another, it offers a set of financial solutions tailored to the specific needs of clinics and healthcare professionals. The startup, co-founded in Miami by brothers Sebastian and Gabriel Chirinos, presented a digital platform that integrates directly with the management systems of partner medical institutions, enabling credit approval processes in a matter of minutes. Latin America registers annually more than $60 billion dollars in direct payments for healthcare services, a phenomenon driven by the limited coverage of private health insurance and the capacity restrictions of public systems. This situation has generated an ecosystem dominated by ‘trickle-down’ lending and, in many cases, recourse to informal financing alternatives with unfavorable conditions for users. The financial structure of the round includes $2 million in equity and $8 million in debt, mainly aimed at the Peruvian market. “The post-investment valuation reaches $7 million, which reflects the investors’ confidence in our model,” a spokesperson told Contxto. Notable investors include Tyler Johnson of HFD and MVRK Capital, who along with Beau Woodward and Jacob Panero will join the board. In Peru, the company has already established agreements with 73 medical centers specializing in areas such as dentistry, ophthalmology and fertility treatments. “Initial data show average amounts of $1,000 per patient with terms up to 24 months and a delinquency of 3.5%, below the regional average,” the spokesperson said of the preliminary results. The growth strategy contemplates a gradual expansion. In the short term, the focus will be on consolidating its presence in Peru, where it plans to add 150 additional clinics over the next 12 months. The startup is preparing to enter the Mexican market, scheduled for the first quarter of 2026, through a strategic alliance with a local operator with extensive experience in the healthcare sector. This approach of expansion through alliances seeks to be replicated in other Central American markets starting in 2027. In terms of challenges, it is known that the sector requires significant amounts of capital to finance loans, while at the same time strict controls on delinquency rates must be maintained. The adoption of the model by clinics and the potential competitive response from traditional players in the financial sector represent critical variables that could influence the company’s future trajectory. The transition from pilot operations to significant scale, particularly with the planned expansion into Mexico, will be a key inflection point. In the meantime, the company is focused on consolidating its position in Peru, optimizing its risk algorithms and strengthening its network of alliances with medical institutions in an effort to build a solid foundation for regional growth.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/argentina-pulls-back-from-the-edge-as-mileis-shock-therapy-delivers/,Milei’s Shock Therapy Puts Argentina on a Path of Recovery - Nearshore Americas,2025-04-30T18:27:07+00:00,Argentina’s battered economy is finally showing signs of revival. President Javier Milei’s radical “shock therapy” is beginning to bear fruit.,"Argentina’s battered economy is finally showing signs of revival. President Javier Milei’s radical “ shock therapy ” is beginning to bear fruit. The fiscal rebound is already visible in the stock market — often viewed as the pulse of the economy. The MERVAL index, Argentina’s benchmark, surged by a staggering 172% in local currency terms in 2024. Economic activity is also gaining traction. As of February, output rose 5.7% year-on-year — marking the fourth consecutive month of growth and the strongest pace since June 2022. The IMF expects the country to register 5.5% growth for 2025. According to President Milei, the economy is expanding at an ‘unadjusted’ annual rate of 10%. This turnaround didn’t happen by chance. It came only after Milei took aim at two of Argentina’s most entrenched problems: a volatile currency and runaway inflation. The Shock Therapy During his election campaign, Milei wielded a symbolic chainsaw, vowing to slash public spending. Once in office, he fulfilled his promise. Austerity hit like a hammer blow. Within months, real public spending was slashed by 30%, as the President cut subsidies for gas, electricity, and other public utilities. More than 36,000 public sector employees were laid off. Twelve ministries were eliminated. Four others — Education, Labor, Social Development, and Culture — were merged into a single super-ministry called Human Capital. Initially, the shock therapy lived up to its name — shocking even the president. For weeks, Buenos Aires’ international airport appeared eerily empty. Trains and subways fell silent. Garbage piled up on the streets as thousands of public workers went on strike in protest. Yet beneath the mounting social tension, the economic logic began to take hold. Inflation, which had soared to nearly 300% annually , finally began to fall. Next came a wave of deregulation. The Milei administration eliminated state controls, including those on house rent and consumer prices. As supply increased, rents dropped over a matter of months. “I lived a year in Argentina in the mid-2010s, and the economy at that time was in a terrible state — shortages, currency controls, out-of-control inflation, clogged ports — you name it. I was not optimistic about it ever turning around,” said Fergus Hodgson, Director at Econ Americas , a US-based financial consultancy, and author of The Latin America Red Pill . Hodgson, however, disagrees with labeling Milei’s policies as “shock therapy.” “He cannot — and has not — enacted the kind of shock therapy he would ideally like to. Still, he has generated many positive outcomes in just a year and a half.” Devaluing Currency Still, many economists argue Milei’s decision to devalue the peso was a textbook case of shock therapy. The president devalued the official exchange rate by more than 50% — a bold move to align it more closely with the black-market “blue dollar” rate. Rather than defending the peso through artificial means, the government allowed market forces to set its value. This began restoring investor confidence and gradually squeezed out parallel currency markets. The result was dramatic. By the end of 2024, inflation had plunged to 118% — a drop of 44.5 percentage points in just one year. The decline continued. By March 2025, annual inflation had fallen to 55.9%. Projections suggest it could dip below 30% before the year ends. To attract foreign investment, his government introduced the RIGI regime — a landmark policy that offers 30 years of fiscal and regulatory stability, tax cuts, and trade incentives for large-scale projects (above $200 million). The framework protects investors against adverse policy shifts and guarantees compensation if these protections are violated. By February 2025, the results were beginning to show. At least 10 energy projects worth a combined $11.593 billion had been submitted under the new regime. In mining, six projects totaling nearly $15 billion were in the pipeline. In April, Milei secured a $20 billion loan from the IMF to support his market-oriented reforms and the dismantling of years of currency and capital controls.

After two years of volunteering, Fraser joined Vistaprint in 2003 as an HR leader, helping the company expand into Jamaica. That experience opened","When Debra Fraser first came to Jamaica from Canada in 2000 on a church mission trip, she never imagined she’d play a growing role in the Caribbean’s fast-growing business process outsourcing industry. After two years of volunteering, Fraser joined Vistaprint in 2003 as an HR leader, helping the company expand into Jamaica. That experience opened her eyes to the hurdles foreign businesses often face when setting up shop in the region, from recruiting local talent to managing wage expectations and understanding government incentives. “Vistaprint did a fantastic job, but it was so much work, trial and error,” Fraser said. “It kind of developed a desire in me to help other companies to not have to go through that.” By 2010, she had started her own call center, which grew to about 50 employees before financial limitations forced her to reposition. She launched an HR outsourcing firm , assisting other companies with their Caribbean operations, often stepping in as the official employer of record. Her company has since had a major impact on Jamaica’s BPO sector, which has grown from around 5,000 workers twenty years ago to about 60,000 today. As a part of that growth, her team recruited over 1,100 employees for ibex, a major BPO company. From the ground up Entrepreneurship is essential across the Caribbean, but it comes along with well-established risks. Small- and medium-sized enterprises make up 99.5% of businesses and provide about 60% of formal jobs, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Nevertheless, these businesses often struggle to get financing, secure collateral, or tap into robust capital markets. “Banks want assets. If you don’t have property, it’s hard to grow,” Fraser said. “There aren’t many grants or angel investors here. I’ve thought about registering my business elsewhere just to access capital.” Jamaica has improved its business climate in recent years and now ranks 71st in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index. After four decades of little to no improvement, the island is expected to see 1 to 2% annual growth over the medium term, according to World Bank Group. Mortgage rates have come down from 17% to about 8%, and the Jamaican dollar is seeing some stability amid a weakening U.S. dollar, Fraser said. Still, many startups have no choice but to bootstrap. Fraser considers herself lucky that she was able to use family-owned land as leverage to secure funding for her endeavors. Today, her company serves clients around the world and specializes in remote-first hiring. This approach eliminates the need for expensive office space by finding skilled workers for businesses that operate virtually — a trend that gained momentum during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Our clients cut 70% off labor costs by hiring in Jamaica,” she said. “And they’re getting high-quality workers with years of BPO experience. It’s a no-brainer.” Fraser believes smaller firms like hers are well-suited to succeed, especially as larger BPO providers deal with increasing costs. She also points to rising competition from gig economy platforms like Fiverr and Upwork, which attract Caribbean freelancers but don’t contribute to local tax systems. “The gig economy is already here,” Fraser said. “But if you’re not on a payroll, you can’t access benefits like Jamaica’s housing trust. That’s a missed opportunity for both workers and the country.” The fight to stay competitive Nearby, countries like Trinidad and Tobago are pouring money into the sector — more than $245 million — to create thousands of new jobs. With strong English language skills and proximity to the U.S., the Caribbean takes advantage of the typical nearshore selling points. But Fraser warns that to stay competitive, the region needs better policies, more funding opportunities, and stronger digital infrastructure. “The labor is here, the skills are here,” she said. “What we need now is better support for the people building the future from the ground up.” According to the Global Services Association of Jamaica, about 70 companies make up the country’s BPO sector. And while some worry artificial intelligence could replace jobs, GSAJ President Wayne Sinclair believes technology could improve productivity and lead to new roles. The global services sector remains a major job engine, with a 61.5% jump in employment over the past eight years, according to Minister of Industry, Investment and Commerce Senator Aubyn Hill.

Depending on the success of their business models (revenue generated), the supported startups will repay their debt in fixed installments over a term of up to 36 months. BID Lab’s lead specialist, Carolina Carrasco, explained that “Chile’s productivity and sustainable growth challenges cannot be addressed without innovation and the incorporation of new technologies, which often face difficulties in obtaining financing precisely because of this innovation”. The region’s high economic dependence on fossil fuels represents a difficult challenge to overcome. In addition to growing emissions from deforestation, high transition costs, and other challenges in the fight to mitigate climate change, the region needs to develop financial plans and adopt green fiscal rules. According to a report by the United Nations Development Program, while the region has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and is aiming for net zero emissions by 2050, ecosystem cooperation and support for innovation are key to making progress towards these goals. In a press release shared with Contxto, Sebastián Burgos, Director of Business Development at ChileGlobal Ventures of Fundación Chile, who also leads the fund, said that “this is an instrument that closes a gap faced by startups with climate innovations, which are not accessing venture capital in an agile way, but which are not eligible to be financed by traditional banks due to their characteristics.” The companies that will be able to access this benefit are those that are being or have been accelerated by ChileGlobal Ventures programs, that are in the growth phase and that implement innovative technologies, technically and commercially validated. In addition, companies interested in accessing the Green Hub fund must contribute to sustainable growth, resilience and sustainability and ensure commitment to the implementation of ESG criteria and monitoring of their impact metrics, i.e. that their business practices are consistent with the fight for environmental sustainability.

The funds will be used to accelerate its expansion in Latin America, where it already operates in markets such as Chile, Mexico and Colombia. The AI-based business tools sector has grown 34% year-on-year in the region, according to Americas Market Intelligence data . However, many existing solutions face adoption problems due to their complexity and high costs. “Sixty percent of sales teams in the region still rely on spreadsheets and manual processes,” noted a recent Endeavor study. diio was created by Paolo Colonnello, former product manager at Capitalizarme, and Nicolás Kipreos de la Fuente, co-founder of Beetrack –acquired by DispatchTrack in 2021. The platform automatically analyzes meetings, calls and messages to identify sales opportunities, churn risks and pending proposals. “The problem was not the lack of data, but the inability to transform it into concrete actions,” Colonnello explained to Contxto. According to company figures, 70% of the information generated in commercial processes is never used to make decisions. Currently, more than 200 companies use diio, including Buk, Xepelin and Betterfly. Some cases report significant improvements, for example Buk increased the completeness of its CRM by 95%. They also shared data on Webdox, which doubled its conversion rates in meetings. The Latin American business software market is growing at a rate of 28% per year, driven by the digitalization of SMEs and large companies. However, only 15% of organizations in the region use tools with advanced AI capabilities, according to IDC. With the new investment, diio plans to enhance its SPARK model, which uses generative AI to analyze business performance. In 2023, the platform was selected by AWS out of 4,700 global startups for its potential for impact. “diio is changing how commercial teams work, not just adding another tool,” said Rexhi Dollaku of Base10 Partners, in a press release. The venture capital firm has invested in several Latin American tech startups, although it scaled back its operations in the region during 2022. The challenge now will be to scale in a market where 40% of commercial software implementations fail in the first six months, according to Gartner. “The key is to maintain simplicity while adding advanced capabilities,” Kipreos concluded. As the industry moves toward greater automation, solutions such as diio seek to close the gap between business data and concrete actions, a problem that according to consulting firms such as McKinsey costs Latin American companies up to $23 billion annually in lost opportunities.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/aws-mexico-explained-a-new-tech-cornerstone-in-mexico/,AWS Mexico Explained: A New Tech Cornerstone in Mexico - Nearshore Americas,2025-02-06T16:55:16+00:00,"""I believe the new Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud 'region' will bring a lot to Mexico and all its industries,"" says David Victoria, a Senior Cloud Architect for Caylent in Latin America and one of the main ambassadors of Amazon's newest technology project. ""However, I still think there's many things to ask Santa for."" Querétaro","“I believe the new Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud ‘region’ will bring a lot to Mexico and all its industries,” says David Victoria , a Senior Cloud Architect for Caylent in Latin America and one of the main ambassadors of Amazon’s newest technology project. “However, I still think there’s many things to ask Santa for.” Querétaro is the second Latin American city to host an AWS Region, following São Paulo. This Region, with three Availability Zones accessible via the API code mx-central-1 , will offer low-latency cloud services, enhanced data sovereignty, and increased opportunities for digital transformation. It expands upon Amazon’s existing Local Zone (smaller-scale data center deployments) in Querétaro and Points of Presence (PoPs, which are caché storing edge locations) in Monterrey, Puebla, Tlalnepantla, Tlaquepaque, Torreón and Querétaro. The news comes at a time when costs for software development in Mexico are increasingly becoming less of an advantage. Fortunately, the AWS region addresses the remaining two factors of the “Iron Triangle” in nearshoring IT services. With cost competitiveness fading, the industry is now prioritizing faster delivery and higher-quality end products. According to Mexican Tech Expert Enrique Cortés-Rello , AWS Mexico has contributed significantly to boost the region’s tech ecosystem. “It consolidates the country as the region’s main technology hub. More cloud computing infrastructure means a stronger appeal for business and a wider array of available computing tools for companies, entrepreneurs, governments, and academia.” The US tech giant has recently announced plans to invest $5 billion in Mexico over the next 15 years. This investment is expected to create 7,000 jobs and contribute $10 billion to the country’s GDP. This investment also promises to boost the nation’s digital future. The cloud initiative’s hardware and software are being implemented alongside a comprehensive community building program and robust sustainability protocols and projects. These initiatives demonstrate the company’s awareness of protests in Latin America surrounding data center deployment and environmental concerns. According to David, the program includes: Most sustainability strategies appear to have a long-term focus, leaving uncertainty about whether AWS can respond swiftly and effectively to the pressing challenges in cloud and AI development. That said, the AWS Mexico Region has introduced initiatives to promote STEM education and provide targeted support for women and children pursuing careers in IT. Among the most significant efforts is a $300,000 fund dedicated to advancing technology-focused community projects in Querétaro. “In the past, businesses had to purchase expensive hardware, install it on-premises, and maintain it themselves,” says David. “With cloud computing, companies can rent infrastructure on demand, scaling up or down as needed, without large upfront costs.” AWS Availability Zones provide a robust platform for complex code loading, execution, testing, and development. This results in faster application performance, a better user experience, and new opportunities for industries dependent on real-time computing. These benefits extend beyond Mexico; having AWS data centers geographically closer should reduce friction in client experience and enhance software design capabilities. AWS offers Amazon Connect, a cloud-based call center solution that streamlines communication and improves service quality. David explained that, with the impact of a local AWS Region on the available digital infrastructure landscape, call centers can anticipate lower call drop rates and improved voice quality, reduced latency for real-time customer interactions, and increased scalability, enabling businesses to adjust resources according to demand. For developers and tech companies exporting services internationally, utilizing a local cloud region offers numerous advantages. “We say ‘cloud is your new local’,” David remarks, emphasizing that the infrastructure provided by AWS includes a sophisticated, extensive, and unique coding toolkit designed to support the majority of software development needs. From a business perspective, this translates to faster development cycles, achieved through testing and deploying software closer to end-users; lower costs compared to hosting services in distant regions; and facilitated global expansion via a multi-region cloud architecture. Both providers and consumers in the nearshore model will benefit from the ability to extend their service offerings to industries demanding high data sovereignty or low-latency standards previously unattainable. Organizations in sectors like banking, government, and healthcare can now leverage cloud services to achieve their objectives, overcoming regulatory hurdles that previously mandated in-country data hosting. However, there comes David’s most serious critique of the AWS Region: “Unfortunately, it doesn’t come with all the functions”. Take Hardware Security Modules : a high-level, coding-heavy security procedure used to record, archive and utilize sensitive data. It is now standard for a lot of licensing on cybersecurity. “Yet it is not available to utilize for the AWS Mexico Region. It is a function of data infrastructure that has been deployed in other AWS regions.” Cortés-Rello explained it’s common for different cloud service regions to include different services. “It depends on hardware and software implemented on the region’s data centers. For example, US Regions provide services aligned with HIPAA (US health regulation standards). That is not that important for us.” David expressed his hope that this exclusion is only temporary. He emphasized the lack of logic in omitting high-end security functions, particularly given the rise of increasingly complex cyberattacks and widespread concerns about data safety, especially when deploying technology designed to create faster, better products that aim to bolster digital sovereignty. AWS’s expansion into Mexico is more than just an investment in infrastructure—it’s a gateway to digital transformation for businesses of all sizes. While the project may not yet be flawless, and while it may present sustainability challenges, it undeniably demonstrates that long-term, focused private investment can, at times, drive greater resources toward digital transformation than government initiatives. Collaboration between the two can further accelerate the region’s pursuit of competitiveness in digital markets. With the offer of lower latency, improved security, and sustainable computing, Amazon’s move can accelerate cloud adoption across industries. As businesses in Mexico and Latin America embrace cloud technologies, they will be better positioned to compete globally, innovate faster, and reduce operational costs. For companies considering cloud migration, now is the time to take advantage of AWS’s growing presence in Latin America—leveraging world-class cloud services, closer to home. Other experts agree with Victoria and Cortés-Rello on their enthusiasm for the project, noting that it solidifies Querétaro’s position as a host city for “regions” established by all major cloud service providers (Oracle, Google, Microsoft, and AWS). However, they also emphasize the potential for further investment to explore other areas of the web services supply chain. In Cortés-Rello’s words: “investment should now go to creation and not only to cloud services provision. To complement this technological leap, we need investment in startups and advanced R&D in Mexico. We can’t just be consumers. We [as an increasingly leading country in the tech sector] need to turn into creators.” Colombian business, politics, and cultural journalist. Managing Editor for Nearshore Americas and El Enemigo.

Yet, Chile and Puerto Rico shine as beacons of hope, according to the Digital Competitiveness Ranking , prepared by Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development (IMD). Strong ICT infrastructure and pro-business policies are driving digital transformation in Chile and Puerto Rico. However, when it comes to technology integration, every country in the region lags. The report emphasizes that adopting new technologies is no longer optional but essential for economic growth. Delays in tech adoption could widen the digital divide, hampering progress and limiting economic potential. The IMD highlights technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and quantum computing as key drivers of economic growth. AI, for instance, can enhance productivity , blockchain can improve governance transparency and reduce corruption, while quantum computing can bolster research and innovation. The IMD analyzed seven countries: Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Peru, and Venezuela. The report’s analysts have urged Mexico to alleviate business community concerns by reducing policy uncertainty and strengthening democratic institutions. Argentina, the analysts insist, should liberalize forex regulations and mitigate the impact of economic turmoil on businesses to support its digital companies. Brazil, the region’s largest economy, lags in many segments of the digital economy, primarily due to a lack of quality education, which perpetuates a talent shortage. Colombia, according to the report, is preparing well for the future but is slow to adopt cutting-edge technologies like AI and quantum computing. Sporadic power outages in recent months are deterring investors, the report warns, suggesting that Colombia should rebuild its power infrastructure. Chile: the Rising Star Chile slipped from 39th to 42nd in the latest ranking compared to 2021. Despite this decline, the country’s strong ICT infrastructure and expansive data center networks position it well to harness advanced technologies. Valparaíso , a key port city, leads the way with average internet speeds of 321.85 Mbps, outperforming many U.S. cities and ranking as the world’s fastest for network access, according to the Global Speedtest Index . Pablo Rossel Estay, head of BPO firm CGS’s operations in Chile , credits the country’s ICT advancements to its telecom sector liberalization in the 1980s. “Large-scale projects like the Humboldt Cable—a 14,000 km undersea link connecting Chile to Australia—have further reinforced Chile’s role as a regional data center hub,” he explained. While the report highlights significant efficiency gains among Chilean businesses and improved access to finance, Claudia Perez, IT and Technology Recruitment Specialist at Robert Walters in Chile, sees challenges, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). “Many smaller businesses still struggle due to limited resources for digital transformation,” she noted. A digital transformation law enacted in 2019 mandates technological adoption, but implementation has been sluggish. Cybersecurity, however, has seen notable progress, with stricter regulations enacted to safeguard personal information. “Chile’s laws progress slowly, creating a complex regulatory environment. Some initiatives, like electronic signatures and data governance policies, have helped regulate aspects of the digital economy. Still, there’s much more to be done,” she added. One of Chile’s most pressing issues remains the shortage of qualified tech talent. “While Chile has a sizable pool of tech professionals, the situation is complicated. Many lack certifications or the necessary skills for emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI),” Perez added. The problem is exacerbated as foreign companies attract top talent with competitive salaries and fully remote work opportunities.  Perez warns that a lack of advanced training and low technical skills could stifle Chile’s digital growth. Promising Puerto Rico Like Chile, Puerto Rico benefits from a strong ICT infrastructure. Despite the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017, the US territory rebounded quickly. “Puerto Rico has a limited data center, peering, and cloud infrastructure. However, it does host landing stations for over a dozen submarine cables,” says Jon Hjembo , Senior Research Manager at TeleGeography . Hjembo believes Puerto Rico could see more submarine cables running through its territory in the years to come. “San Juan serves as a key node for cables spanning Latin America, the Caribbean, and the continental U.S.,” he adds. However, Puerto Rico faces a worsening talent shortage, a challenge similar to other Latin American nations. According to Boston Consulting Group, only 2.8% of the island’s workforce is employed in the digital sector, compared to up to 10% in comparable markets. Higher education institutions are another weak point, producing only about 100 graduates annually in high-tech fields. Many of these graduates leave the island for better opportunities and higher salaries, particularly on the US mainland.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/pandemic-shift-reversed-latam-heads-back-to-office/,Pandemic Shift Reversed? LatAm Heads Back to Office - Nearshore Americas,2025-01-21T18:39:50+00:00,"Across Latin America, the remote work revolution appears to be grinding to a halt.","Across Latin America, the remote work revolution appears to be grinding to a halt. As 2025 progresses, offices are reclaiming their dominance, and the work-from-home era looks increasingly like a fleeting pandemic experiment. The region is now leading the world in five-day in-person work, according to a recent JLL real estate consultancy study. Six out of ten companies in the region have already ditched remote arrangements, pulling their workforce back to desks. Peru stands out for its tough stance—remote work is almost extinct. Barely 10% of service sector workers still work from home. Meanwhile, other countries are following suit: Colombia sees 72% of its workforce back in offices, Brazil 60%, Chile 56%, and Mexico 54%. In Peru, of the 764 companies that adopted remote work during the pandemic, a staggering 90% plan to fully return to in-office setups by early 2025, according to ResumeBuilder.com . Real estate lobbying, unmotivated employees, and strict government regulations are collectively casting a shadow over the future of remote work. There are cultural factors also, stated Mark Beyer, founder of Mybey Ventures . “Supervisors in Latin America often prefer direct oversight. Remote work disrupts this dynamic, leaving managers uneasy about accountability and day-to-day control.” In Mexico, many firms have ended remote work due to concerns about decreased productivity and difficulties in maintaining employee oversight. “The culture in Mexico is not one of a lot of trust. Companies feel that during the Pandemic many employees started to abuse the home office situation, not being controlled by the management,” said Peter Kroll , Country Manager for Novacomp in Mexico. “Productivity of many workers went down when working 100% remotely and companies believe this is because there were too many distractions working from home.” Some countries introduced remote work regulations to benefit employees, but ironically, these measures indirectly pressured companies to abandon remote working altogether. In Mexico, for instance, government required companies to pay for home office essentials—chairs, internet, electricity—and take responsibility for employee health and safety at home. “This is difficult to implement,” says Kroll. “Many companies simply don’t want to bear these risks.” The primary argument, says Dionisio Chiuratto Agourakis , CEO of JAI , a São Paulo-based company that offers AI support to boost productivity, is that in-person work is more productive than remote work. “This is especially relevant for junior employees, who miss out on the benefits of being in a physical workplace, such as learning from colleagues, observing workplace dynamics, and improving through direct interactions.” A less-discussed but growing issue, Agourakis said, was  the trend of employees holding multiple full-time remote jobs simultaneously—sometimes as many as three or four—without informing their employers. This behaviour, widely discussed by employees on Reddit and Twitter, has made companies more skeptical about remote work, he added. “In Brazil, some organizations implemented strict measures such as requiring webcams and microphones to be on during work hours, or monitoring keyboard and mouse activity, to ensure productivity.” The Challenge of Retaining Staff With the decline in remote work, retaining employees will become a significant challenge for companies already grappling with talent shortages. In late 2024, workforce analytics firm Revelio uncovered a troubling trend: return-to-office (RTO) policies were shrinking workforces in many organizations. Analyzing hiring and attrition data from public U.S. companies, Revelio found a stark contrast. Since June 2022, when RTO mandates gained momentum, firms offering flexible work have grown their workforce by 1.6%, compared to just 1% growth for companies enforcing in-office attendance. “Yes, companies are aware that they will lose precious talent. But it was inevitable” Agourakis added. Ultimately, companies may need to explore ways to adapt teleworking model to improve employee retention. In a similar JLL survey conducted in 2024 , 62% of respondents said they may plan to create a network of workspaces closer to employees’ homes, aiming to make the transition more appealing and retain talent.

This transaction comes at a key moment for the company, which was recently recognized as the second fastest growing scale-up in Spain after exceeding €10 million in turnover. The Latin American market has become a pillar for TaxDown, with Mexico representing 35% of its volume of operations. Enrique García, CEO of the company, explained to Contxto the reasons for this approach: “We identified that 8 out of 10 taxpayers are entitled to a refund, but 60% never claim it, leaving up to 15,000 Mexican pesos unrecovered”. This situation is partly due to the “fear of SAT” (Mexico’s Tax Administration Service) that persists among the population. “Many people prefer not to touch anything for fear of making mistakes,” García stated. To address this problem, TaxDown has developed solutions adapted to the local context, managing in just one year of operations to capture 1.5 million users in the country.","Spain’s TaxDown has closed a €4 million investment round led by Bonsai Partners, a renowned venture capital fund with stakes in companies such as Wallapop and Glovo.

TaxDown’s model combines artificial intelligence with a team of more than 200 tax advisors. Its system has processed more than 2 million personal income tax simulations between Spain and Mexico, automatically analyzing more than 500 tax variables. The results are convincing: a 40% reduction in common tax return errors and detection of non-applied deductions in 32% of cases. “AI does not replace the expert, but it multiplies their efficiency,” García emphasized. This technological synergy allows advisors to resolve queries 200 times more efficiently, thanks to tools that automate everything from data extraction to regulatory updates. The new funds will be used primarily to strengthen the AI team and expand operations in Mexico. “We are developing personalized alerts, intelligent tax recommendations and better integration with official sources,” the CEO advanced.

This investment reflects a global trend in the tax fintech sector, which has captured more than US$1.2 billion by 2024 according to CB Insights. Latin America represents 15% of this growing market, with Mexico and Brazil as the main focus of expansion. With this investment and its efficient growth model, TaxDown is positioned as a case study in the application of AI to simplify complex processes.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/year-of-droughts-and-wildfires-hits-south-america-hard/,Year of Droughts and Wildfires Hits South America Hard - Nearshore Americas,2025-03-12T13:04:18+00:00,"South America appears to be at the frontline of the climate crisis blamed on global warming, with wildfires wreaking havoc across the region.","South America appears to be at the frontline of the climate crisis blamed on global warming.  In 2024, a staggering 79 million hectares — an area dwarfing entire nations — were consumed by wildfires. Bolivia lost over 16 million hectares, nearly 15% of its land, an expanse exceeding the size of Nicaragua. Brazil’s vastness offered no sanctuary, as 59.2 million hectares, a territory equivalent to Paraguay, turned to ash. Venezuela, second only to Bolivia in devastation, saw 9% of its sovereign land reduced to a charred wasteland. The inferno killed hundreds of people and left thousands of homes damaged. Wildfires are nothing new to South America, but never before had they threatened urban centers on this scale. In February last year, flames engulfed several smaller towns of Chile’s Vilapraso, reducing hundreds of houses to ash, while in Argentina, residents of Capilla del Monte and Los Cocos were to be evacuated as the inferno closed in. The worst-hit regions include Brazil’s northern Amazon, Venezuela’s Maracaibo, and the Gran Chaco, which stretches across Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay. Relentless droughts and sudden floods are upending economies. Failed crops are pushing rural families into urban slums. Reservoirs are drying up , crippling hydroelectric power supplies in Ecuador and Colombia. Increasing Dry Days South America is drying out at an alarming rate, according to a recent study by Communications Earth and Environment . Fifty years ago, the region experienced about 180 dry days a year. Today, that number has surged to 240 — meaning 60 more parched days annually. Paradoxically, rising temperatures are also making storms more violent. As the air holds more moisture, the risk of destructive floods intensifies. Last weekend, Argentina’s port city of Bahía Blanca was blindsided by a sudden deluge. Torrential rains dumped 260 millimeters (10 inches) of water in mere hours, triggering deadly flash floods that killed 16 people. “The region is experiencing sudden and dramatic swings between extreme wet and dry conditions,” said Max Dugan-Knight , a climate scientist with Deep Sky , a Canadian startup aiming to remove gigatons of carbon from the atmosphere. This climatic phenomenon is called “hydroclimate whiplash,” Max added. “These swings might seem like a useful balance, but they are extremely dangerous because they cause flooding and mudslides on the one hand, and wildfires and water scarcity on the other, sometimes in quick succession.” Hydroclimate whiplash was on full display in Bogotá last spring. Months of extreme drought gave way to a deadly flood in November, wreaking havoc on the city of 12 million people. Max warns that this volatility is crippling the region’s agriculture. “That’s why Argentina’s wheat and soybean production has taken such a massive hit. The same goes for Brazil’s coffee industry — water shortages and relentless heat waves have severely impacted yields over the past year.” Chile: The Worst Victim Chile suffered the worst wildfire disaster of any country. In February 2024, the raging fires killed about 136 people and injured nearly 1,200, according to the Pan American Health Organization. In Viña del Mar alone, more than 1,600 people lost their homes as entire neighborhoods burned to the ground. Many survivors took refuge in schools, churches, and hotels. The fires devastated over 64,326 hectares, damaging nearly 15,000 homes — around 6,600 destroyed. In response, the Chilean government declared a State of Constitutional Catastrophe until April 3, 2024. The government estimates the damage at $4.39 billion, which doesn’t include indirect losses such as reduced productivity, environmental destruction, and long-term health effects. “Chile is grappling with persistent drought and severe wildfire seasons,” said Abigail Wellman at T eamPlanting , an Inwood, NY-based company carrying out several reforestation projects across Latin America. Searching for Solutions There’s no quick fix to shield South America from worsening climate change, but the region can strengthen its defenses. “Some of the best defenses available are natural resources like forests, wetlands, and mangroves. These provide a buffer against flooding and can reduce wildfire risk,” Max said. “Prolonged drought can damage the region’s energy security . This means governments should diversify their energy mix, adding more renewables like solar and wind.” Wellman urged immediate action—investing in sustainable practices and early-warning systems to better prepare for extreme weather. Encouraging rural communities to plant trees on a large scale could also help, as trees act as natural shields against drought.

BID Lab’s lead specialist, Carolina Carrasco, explained that “Chile’s productivity and sustainable growth challenges cannot be addressed without innovation and the incorporation of new technologies, which often face difficulties in obtaining financing precisely because of this innovation”. The region’s high economic dependence on fossil fuels represents a difficult challenge to overcome. In addition to growing emissions from deforestation, high transition costs, and other challenges in the fight to mitigate climate change, the region needs to develop financial plans and adopt green fiscal rules. According to a report by the United Nations Development Program, while the region has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and is aiming for net zero emissions by 2050, ecosystem cooperation and support for innovation are key to making progress towards these goals. In a press release shared with Contxto, Sebastián Burgos, Director of Business Development at ChileGlobal Ventures of Fundación Chile, who also leads the fund, said that “this is an instrument that closes a gap faced by startups with climate innovations, which are not accessing venture capital in an agile way, but which are not eligible to be financed by traditional banks due to their characteristics.” The companies that will be able to access this benefit are those that are being or have been accelerated by ChileGlobal Ventures programs, that are in the growth phase and that implement innovative technologies, technically and commercially validated. In addition, companies interested in accessing the Green Hub fund must contribute to sustainable growth, resilience and sustainability and ensure commitment to the implementation of ESG criteria and monitoring of their impact metrics, i.e. that their business practices are consistent with the fight for environmental sustainability.

It is the startup Fastfold, which emerges as an exceptional case in the region: a platform that uses AI to accelerate scientific discovery and democratize research in molecular biology. Founded by Julio Castellanos and Esteban Maya, this company is redefining how protein engineering is approached, a critical field for the development of drugs, resilient crops and innovative therapies. What is most remarkable is that they are doing it from a region that has historically faced economic and technological barriers to compete in global science. In an interview with Contxto, Esteban Maya, CTO of the company, explains their development philosophy: “We have built from scratch, to a functional product and launched in the market with founders’ own money (Bootstrap), and some credits from cloud providers”. This bootstrap approach demonstrates that it is possible to create world-class technology even with limited resources. In addition to starting with little capital, Fastfold has managed to overcome specific obstacles to developing cutting-edge technology in the region, as CEO Julio Castellanos explains: “One of the main challenges in Latin America is the limited access to accelerated computing, due to the high cost of GPUs such as Nvidia’s and the high prices of large-scale cloud”. While startup loans are available, priority is usually given to U.S. companies, leaving those in the region with restricted access. On the other hand, Castellanos comments that “the ecosystem is not yet well articulated to adopt AI solutions with a scientific approach. Most initiatives are focused on commercial applications, while scientific research and publication – which is our focus – receives little institutional support”. However, this reality has not deterred the team, which has adopted an ingenious approach to circumvent these limitations. Fastfold’s platform is achieving what many considered impossible: matching the accuracy of traditional protein research methods. As Castellanos details, “Fastfold offers optimized computation and models such as AlphaFold that not only maintain accuracy comparable to experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography, but also dramatic improvements in speed and cost.” AlphaFold, for example, demonstrated unprecedented performance in the international CASP14 (Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction) competition, which evaluates accuracy in protein structure prediction. “The main metric used by CASP is the Global Distance Test (GDT), which ranges from 0 to 100. Simply put, it can be understood as the percentage of amino acid residues whose predicted position falls within a distance threshold with respect to the actual position,” explains Julio Castellanos. “In CASP14, AlphaFold achieved an average score of 92.4 GDT across all targets, with an average error (RMSD) of approximately 1.6 Ångstroms, i.e., comparable to the width of an atom. Even in the most challenging cases of free modeling, it obtained an average score of 87.0 GDT, far outperforming other methods,” explains Julio Castellanos. For Fastfold’s founders, their initiative transcends the commercial sphere. Esteban Maya says that “artificial intelligence represents a unique opportunity for Latin America to move towards true technological sovereignty, allowing the region not only to consume technology, but also to develop and export it”. This philosophy is materialized in concrete applications that could transform key sectors of the regional economy. In the field of health, the platform could accelerate the development of vaccines and drugs. In agriculture, it offers tools to optimize crops that are resistant to climate change. And in education, it democratizes access to advanced research tools. On future plans, Maya shares a measured strategy: “We want to make some key partnerships, publish some papers and have some revenue, thus demonstrating that with a small team and without requiring large sums of capital, we can achieve a lot”. This approach reflects a deep understanding of the regional investment ecosystem, which, as Maya points out, needs to evolve: “Venture capital should focus on deeptech, climatech, biotech and HealthTech products, which are the sectors that need large amounts of capital to start their projects and validate themselves”. Fastfold represents more than a business success; it is a model of how Latin America can overcome structural limitations to compete in global science. As Castellanos summarizes: “Our focus is on doing science with global impact, but accessible, adapted to a market that is still in the process of consolidation to support deep innovation”. In a world where biotechnology will be key to solving the great challenges of humanity, initiatives such as Fastfold position Latin America as a relevant player in this scientific revolution. Its history shows that with talent, vision and perseverance, the region can not only participate, but lead in the frontier of knowledge. Your email address will not be published.

The funds will be used to accelerate its expansion in Latin America, where it already operates in markets such as Chile, Mexico and Colombia. The AI-based business tools sector has grown 34% year-on-year in the region, according to Americas Market Intelligence data . However, many existing solutions face adoption problems due to their complexity and high costs. “Sixty percent of sales teams in the region still rely on spreadsheets and manual processes,” noted a recent Endeavor study. diio was created by Paolo Colonnello, former product manager at Capitalizarme, and Nicolás Kipreos de la Fuente, co-founder of Beetrack –acquired by DispatchTrack in 2021. The platform automatically analyzes meetings, calls and messages to identify sales opportunities, churn risks and pending proposals. “The problem was not the lack of data, but the inability to transform it into concrete actions,” Colonnello explained to Contxto. According to company figures, 70% of the information generated in commercial processes is never used to make decisions. Currently, more than 200 companies use diio, including Buk, Xepelin and Betterfly. Some cases report significant improvements, for example Buk increased the completeness of its CRM by 95%. They also shared data on Webdox, which doubled its conversion rates in meetings. The Latin American business software market is growing at a rate of 28% per year, driven by the digitalization of SMEs and large companies. However, only 15% of organizations in the region use tools with advanced AI capabilities, according to IDC. With the new investment, diio plans to enhance its SPARK model, which uses generative AI to analyze business performance. In 2023, the platform was selected by AWS out of 4,700 global startups for its potential for impact. “diio is changing how commercial teams work, not just adding another tool,” said Rexhi Dollaku of Base10 Partners, in a press release. The venture capital firm has invested in several Latin American tech startups, although it scaled back its operations in the region during 2022. The challenge now will be to scale in a market where 40% of commercial software implementations fail in the first six months, according to Gartner. “The key is to maintain simplicity while adding advanced capabilities,” Kipreos concluded. As the industry moves toward greater automation, solutions such as diio seek to close the gap between business data and concrete actions, a problem that according to consulting firms such as McKinsey costs Latin American companies up to $23 billion annually in lost opportunities.

However, despite its advantages, its adoption is being held back in the region due to obsolete systems, unclear ROI and tools that still do not communicate well with each other. In Latin America, companies face three main barriers to implementing AI in their services. Systems that are difficult to modernize, a shortage of specialized talent and budgetary constraints. These factors show that during 2024, 78% of Latin American executives considered AI as a strategic priority, only 34% had implemented solutions at scale. In response to this challenge, Nisum and AAIC have formed a strategic alliance with the goal of making AI adoption more accessible, faster and safer for companies struggling with technological complexity. The alliance has launched a full-stack AI support system that promises to eliminate that friction, offering support across a broad scope of IT, from cloud modernization to process automation to intelligent IT operations. With industry experts from leading cloud providers, this alliance brings results-driven, enterprise-level expertise. One of the first fruits of this alliance is OpsPilot, an AI-based solution designed for IT teams overburdened by alert management and staffing shortages. The recent partnership announcement comes at a key moment for Latin America, where enthusiasm for artificial intelligence is colliding with complex operational realities. The alliance has launched a comprehensive AI support system, ranging from cloud modernization to process automation and intelligent IT operations. This tool not only promises to reduce incident resolution time by up to 90%, but also automates critical tasks such as running runbooks, managing tickets and collecting evidence, all in a matter of minutes. “Nisum’s tagline, Building Success Together, reflects our deep commitment to empowering customers and partners to achieve their business goals,” said Imtiaz Mohammady, CEO of Nisum. “This partnership with AAIC reinforces that commitment to creating real and measurable impact in the AI and cloud space.” The a partnership is providing AI that rapidly migrates from legacy systems to the modern cloud stack, Nisum’s existing AI toolset will bring solutions such as code migration, automating code refactoring and reducing downtime risk; GenAI-based recommendations to guide application modernization strategies with intelligent suggestions; among others. The companies say it takes strategy, proof of value and a dedicated team that understands the needs of the business to deliver the right tools. To ensure the right solutions get into the right hands, the team offers customized proposals that show measurable ROI and hands-on workshops for AI and cloud readiness. They focus on PoCs that move quickly from proof to impact, and ongoing collaboration that supports long-term growth. Vijay Roy, CEO of AAIC, explains, “Nisum has a strong legacy of driving digital transformation for Fortune 500 companies, and we are bringing AI-first innovation to the table, built on years of research, development and proprietary frameworks. We are excited about what lies ahead.” The two companies will focus on solving problems that businesses face every day and establish a joint commitment to deliver innovative and secure AI solutions that drive long-term success for their customers.

https://contxto.com/en/news/vetalia-seeks-to-improve-veterinary-services-in-mexico-with-technology/,Vetalia seeks to improve veterinary services in Mexico with technology,2025-04-16T17:34:11+00:00,"María Gutiérrez, co-founder and CEO of Vetalia is convinced that the animal care industry -especially the veterinary service industry- is a very neglected industry in which there are several inefficiencies that have an impact on the quality of services for the end consumer. That is why he founded Vetalia 18 months ago, together with his team formed by Marion Benítez Landa, CGO, Antonio R. Remolina, Chief Medical Officer and Fernando Estrada, COO. The startup has managed to build an innovative and standardized animal health ecosystem with the help of technology. “The consumer is increasingly demanding with the quality of veterinary services and Vetalia is a response to this,” Maria Gutierrez shared to Contxto.","María Gutiérrez, co-founder and CEO of Vetalia is convinced that the animal care industry -especially the veterinary service industry- is a very neglected industry in which there are several inefficiencies that have an impact on the quality of services for the end consumer. That is why he founded Vetalia 18 months ago, together with his team formed by Marion Benítez Landa, CGO, Antonio R. Remolina, Chief Medical Officer and Fernando Estrada, COO. The startup has managed to build an innovative and standardized animal health ecosystem with the help of technology. “The consumer is increasingly demanding with the quality of veterinary services and Vetalia is a response to this,” Maria Gutierrez shared to Contxto. “We saw a huge opportunity in improving customer care and service, in addition to having understood the pain-points of operating a network of hospitals, providing improvements in the animal health ecosystem in general, thus solving problems for ourselves, which we then scaled for other companies,” she added. In a nutshell, Vetalia is an animal health ecosystem (a B2C business) and provides solutions to other animal health companies (through a B2B business). It currently has a portfolio of more than 15,000 clients, with an average recurrence of 5 visits per year. Within the veterinary clinics vertical, it offers preventive services, surgeries, emergencies and specialties. It also has a business sales vertical where it offers diverse solutions to more veterinarians. Gutierrez boasted that from December 2023 to December 2024 they had a revenue growth of 400%, so that by 2025 they are looking to close with triple-digit growth. For now, the company has a portfolio of 10 hospitals of its own, 5 veterinary companies in partnership and two additional verticals of services to the industry. By the end of 2025, the goal is to close with 16 owned clinics and 10 integrated veterinary assets.  Vetalia has managed to scale with control and sustainability, achieving that its hospitals reach the operating break-even point on average in the fourth month of operation. They currently have a presence in Mexico City, State of Mexico and Monterrey. “Our plan is to reach the main cities in the country and expand there,” he said. To finance growth, the company not only leverages its own cash flow, but also the Series A raised in 2023, in which it raised 10 million dollars from IGZUS, a private equity fund, and strategic investors. According to Storecheck , a market data analytics firm, the pet care industry will reach $90.4 billion by 2025, growing at 4.5% annually. This industry still has the potential to transform through technology. Another example of this is Petycard, a Mexican startup that offers a digital loyalty card that connects pet lovers with businesses that offer products and services, from veterinarians to pet-friendly restaurants. Jorge Kuri, founder of Petycard, said that in Mexico around 70% have a pet and are more concerned than before about their care. At Vetalia, technology is a central asset, said Gutiérrez. “We use it both to streamline our operations and reduce costs, which translates into a benefit for users, and to provide a customer service platform that also drives our growth and ability to attract and retain customers.” For Gutiérrez, the main problem that Vetalia solves is customer service. The CEO explained that with technology, through the platform, she gives her clients the opportunity to schedule appointments, have centralized clinical records and follow up on their pets, which creates a much more complete experience. On the other hand, Vetalia is developing technology to offer various solutions to more veterinarians and thus consolidate its B2B vertical. “Technology has been a great ally to solve operational inefficiencies,” concluded the entrepreneur.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/chile-and-puerto-rico-latams-top-digitally-competitive-economies/,Chile and Puerto Rico: LatAm’s Top Digitally Competitive Economies - Nearshore Americas,2024-12-17T18:12:30+00:00,"Poor educational system and reluctance to embrace new technology weakening digital competency in LatAm, but Chile and Puerto Rico shine as beacons of hope.","The poor educational system and reluctance to embrace new technology solutions are weakening the digital competency of many Latin American countries. Yet, Chile and Puerto Rico shine as beacons of hope, according to the Digital Competitiveness Ranking , prepared by Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development (IMD). Strong ICT infrastructure and pro-business policies are driving digital transformation in Chile and Puerto Rico. However, when it comes to technology integration, every country in the region lags. The report emphasizes that adopting new technologies is no longer optional but essential for economic growth. Delays in tech adoption could widen the digital divide, hampering progress and limiting economic potential. The IMD highlights technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and quantum computing as key drivers of economic growth. AI, for instance, can enhance productivity , blockchain can improve governance transparency and reduce corruption, while quantum computing can bolster research and innovation. The IMD analyzed seven countries: Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Peru, and Venezuela. The report’s analysts have urged Mexico to alleviate business community concerns by reducing policy uncertainty and strengthening democratic institutions. Argentina, the analysts insist, should liberalize forex regulations and mitigate the impact of economic turmoil on businesses to support its digital companies. Brazil, the region’s largest economy, lags in many segments of the digital economy, primarily due to a lack of quality education, which perpetuates a talent shortage. Colombia, according to the report, is preparing well for the future but is slow to adopt cutting-edge technologies like AI and quantum computing. Sporadic power outages in recent months are deterring investors, the report warns, suggesting that Colombia should rebuild its power infrastructure. Chile: the Rising Star Chile slipped from 39th to 42nd in the latest ranking compared to 2021. Despite this decline, the country’s strong ICT infrastructure and expansive data center networks position it well to harness advanced technologies. Valparaíso , a key port city, leads the way with average internet speeds of 321.85 Mbps, outperforming many U.S. cities and ranking as the world’s fastest for network access, according to the Global Speedtest Index . Pablo Rossel Estay, head of BPO firm CGS’s operations in Chile , credits the country’s ICT advancements to its telecom sector liberalization in the 1980s. “Large-scale projects like the Humboldt Cable—a 14,000 km undersea link connecting Chile to Australia—have further reinforced Chile’s role as a regional data center hub,” he explained. While the report highlights significant efficiency gains among Chilean businesses and improved access to finance, Claudia Perez, IT and Technology Recruitment Specialist at Robert Walters in Chile, sees challenges, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). “Many smaller businesses still struggle due to limited resources for digital transformation,” she noted. A digital transformation law enacted in 2019 mandates technological adoption, but implementation has been sluggish. Cybersecurity, however, has seen notable progress, with stricter regulations enacted to safeguard personal information. “Chile’s laws progress slowly, creating a complex regulatory environment. Some initiatives, like electronic signatures and data governance policies, have helped regulate aspects of the digital economy. Still, there’s much more to be done,” she added. One of Chile’s most pressing issues remains the shortage of qualified tech talent. “While Chile has a sizable pool of tech professionals, the situation is complicated. Many lack certifications or the necessary skills for emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI),” Perez added. The problem is exacerbated as foreign companies attract top talent with competitive salaries and fully remote work opportunities.  Perez warns that a lack of advanced training and low technical skills could stifle Chile’s digital growth. Promising Puerto Rico Like Chile, Puerto Rico benefits from a strong ICT infrastructure. Despite the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017, the US territory rebounded quickly. “Puerto Rico has a limited data center, peering, and cloud infrastructure. However, it does host landing stations for over a dozen submarine cables,” says Jon Hjembo , Senior Research Manager at TeleGeography . Hjembo believes Puerto Rico could see more submarine cables running through its territory in the years to come. “San Juan serves as a key node for cables spanning Latin America, the Caribbean, and the continental U.S.,” he adds. However, Puerto Rico faces a worsening talent shortage, a challenge similar to other Latin American nations. According to Boston Consulting Group, only 2.8% of the island’s workforce is employed in the digital sector, compared to up to 10% in comparable markets. Higher education institutions are another weak point, producing only about 100 graduates annually in high-tech fields. Many of these graduates leave the island for better opportunities and higher salaries, particularly on the US mainland.

On one hand, it facilitates access to credit for patients who need to cover immediate medical expenses. On another, it offers a set of financial solutions tailored to the specific needs of clinics and healthcare professionals. The startup, co-founded in Miami by brothers Sebastian and Gabriel Chirinos, presented a digital platform that integrates directly with the management systems of partner medical institutions, enabling credit approval processes in a matter of minutes. Latin America registers annually more than $60 billion dollars in direct payments for healthcare services, a phenomenon driven by the limited coverage of private health insurance and the capacity restrictions of public systems. This situation has generated an ecosystem dominated by ‘trickle-down’ lending and, in many cases, recourse to informal financing alternatives with unfavorable conditions for users. The financial structure of the round includes $2 million in equity and $8 million in debt, mainly aimed at the Peruvian market. “The post-investment valuation reaches $7 million, which reflects the investors’ confidence in our model,” a spokesperson told Contxto. Notable investors include Tyler Johnson of HFD and MVRK Capital, who along with Beau Woodward and Jacob Panero will join the board. In Peru, the company has already established agreements with 73 medical centers specializing in areas such as dentistry, ophthalmology and fertility treatments. “Initial data show average amounts of $1,000 per patient with terms up to 24 months and a delinquency of 3.5%, below the regional average,” the spokesperson said of the preliminary results. The growth strategy contemplates a gradual expansion. In the short term, the focus will be on consolidating its presence in Peru, where it plans to add 150 additional clinics over the next 12 months. The startup is preparing to enter the Mexican market, scheduled for the first quarter of 2026, through a strategic alliance with a local operator with extensive experience in the healthcare sector. This approach of expansion through alliances seeks to be replicated in other Central American markets starting in 2027. In terms of challenges, it is known that the sector requires significant amounts of capital to finance loans, while at the same time strict controls on delinquency rates must be maintained. The adoption of the model by clinics and the potential competitive response from traditional players in the financial sector represent critical variables that could influence the company’s future trajectory. The transition from pilot operations to significant scale, particularly with the planned expansion into Mexico, will be a key inflection point. In the meantime, the company is focused on consolidating its position in Peru, optimizing its risk algorithms and strengthening its network of alliances with medical institutions in an effort to build a solid foundation for regional growth.

The capital raised is an extension of its previous funding and included participation from diverse investors such as Acrew Capital, Alter Global, Citi Ventures, Citius, Coatue, Commerce Ventures, DST Global, Endeavor Catalyst, Evolution Ventures, Gaingels, Kaszek Ventures, Monashees, Moore Strategic Ventures, Notable Capital and Picus Capital. In addition to growth funding from General Catalyst’s Customer Value Fund. A significant portion of the capital will be used to scale the commercial team and support efforts to strengthen the company’s presence in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia, according to a statement. Clara’s team currently totals more than 300 people, most of whom are in Mexico, a company spokesperson told Contxto. With the new funding, Clara also has a particular focus on accelerating growth in the mid-market and enterprise segments. Currently with more than 20,000 customers in Latin America and a transaction processed every second, Clara’s ecosystem is designed to automate financial operations with greater efficiency. “This new round of financing will allow us to make the necessary investments to maintain this pace of growth, both today and in the future. In the short term, the CVF funding earmarked for sales and marketing is allowing us to expand our enterprise sales team-including presence in a dozen new cities in the region-and invest in new marketing initiatives,” Gerry Giacoman, CEO of Clara, told Contxto. Clara’s offering – which includes corporate cards, invoice management, vendor payments, international payments and proprietary real-time expense control software – is seeing positive numbers. In a statement Gerry Giacoman Colyer, CEO of Clara, said that in Brazil they reached monthly breakeven at the end of last year, and are close to achieving it also in Mexico as an independent operation. “We have a fully funded business plan, and this raise – with the backing of our investors – allows us to bet more strongly on the opportunity and further accelerate growth. We are investing significantly in artificial intelligence internally and also have open positions in areas such as sales and engineering,” he explained. “Clara is on an accelerated growth trajectory. In fact, we were recognized by the Financial Times as the fastest growing company in Latin America and the second fastest growing company in the entire Americas, based on the presentation of our audited financial statements,” Giacoman said in a written response. Launched in 2021, Clara has been among the fastest-growing Latin American startups. So far it had raised $492 million in debt and venture capital. Just months after its founding by Gerry Giacoman and Diego Garcia, in March 2021 it received a $3.5 million seed round that boosted its startup. Two months later it announced that it closed a $30 million Series A round of funding. In addition to securing a $50 million revolving credit facility. In December 2021 it received a $70 million investment round led by Cotaue, who has invested in tech companies such as Tik Tok, which brought Clara to unicorn status, i.e. a startup with a valuation in excess of $1 billion. In August 2022 Clara disclosed that it obtained a $150 million credit line from Goldman Sachs, in a year in which Latin startups turned to this type of financing due to venture capitalists’ wariness of high interest rates. Even as the venture capital ecosystem slowed, Clara received a large $60 million round in 2023 in a round led by GGV Capital. At the time, from his office in Brasilia, Brazil’s capital, Giacoman, its CEO, told Contxto that “unlike 2021, when we raised three rounds of capitalization quickly, raising in 2023 required much more attention.” The investment was intended to double its presence in Mexico. Also in 2023 Clara moved its headquarters from Mexico to Brazil after obtaining a license from the central bank to operate as a payment institution, which would boost its expansion in that country. Clara told Contxto that Mexico is currently its main market, with Brazil slightly behind. For the time being, the startup – which recently celebrated its fourth anniversary – continues to innovate in its ecosystem. It has just launched a series of AI-powered solutions to simplify the day-to-day life of financial teams, as well as vertical payment solutions such as VCNs – masked, highly configurable virtual card numbers – for the travel industry, and fuel cards for logistics-focused companies.

As the saturation of more established hubs in Mexico, Colombia and various Central American countries solidifies, Hermosillo’s providers plan to attract more businesses,","Hermosillo, the capital of the Mexican state of Sonora, increasingly attracts the interest of market participants looking to optimize operations and maintain competitive advantages in the Latin America and Caribbean BPO market. As the saturation of more established hubs in Mexico, Colombia and various Central American countries solidifies, Hermosillo’s providers plan to attract more businesses, according to government officials and industry leaders present during the “BPO Influencers and CX Leadership Summit” on March 14. The summit was organized by Alliance BPO Services , a Hermosillo-based BPO provider with global presence for multiple industries in North America, Latin America & Caribbean. Alliance BPO Services offers custom-tailored agreements, with performance commitments aligned to their client success, instead of standard service contracts. Local insights are crucial to understanding why Hermosillo is capturing interest and how it compares with established BPO hotspots in the region. Local Talent Pool and Workforce Dynamics Around a dozen international BPOs currently operate in Hermosillo, according to research from the firm Ryan Strategic Advisory . The city boasts a young, educated workforce, a significant advantage for BPO firms. Hermosillo has a population of around one million people. “The fresh talent coming out of our universities is not only tech-savvy but also adaptable. We see graduates translating their knowledge into real-world skills for service excellence,” said local entrepreneur and Alliance BPO Services CEO Juan Caire. Caire added that Hermosillo’s universities and technical schools are focusing on producing graduates well-versed in technology, administration, and languages, which is essential for catering to diverse client needs. This growing talent pool allows companies like Alliance BPO Services to meet specific customer demands effectively. “Our clients frequently note that our staff’s linguistic abilities and cultural familiarity with the US audience set us apart; it’s more than just outsourcing; it is about creating a seamless extension of their teams,” said Alliance BPO Services Co-founder Daniel Castilla. For Peter Ryan, President and Principal Analyst of Ryan Strategic Advisory, Alliance BPO Services is taking a pragmatic and practical approach to its development of AI tools. “By applying the technology in areas in which it can make a positive difference to the consumer, as opposed to pushing it into use cases where it may not be ready, Alliance BPO is likely to gain traction from its current and existing clients searching for a full service provider,” Ryan told Nearshore Americas. Adopting Technology and AI Hermosillo operators understand that they are pursuing market shares growth in highly competitive market macro conditions. Firms like Alliance BPO Services expect that an “all in” approach to technology will differentiate their unique value proposition. Alliance BPO Services is pioneering efforts to integrate artificial intelligence into their operations, not to substitute human agents, but to enhance their capabilities. “AI enables us to improve efficiency and quality of service. Clients are responding positively, reporting faster response times and improved satisfaction through AI-supported customer interactions. We are not trying to replace our employees but help them identify gaps and improve their performance,” Castilla said. Live translation technologies are becoming a staple. “With our ability to communicate in real time with customers across cultures, we can bridge language barriers that have historically impeded efficiency,” Caire said. This tech-savvy approach ensures that Hermosillo remains competitive, particularly in industries that require immediate and multilingual support. Strategic Location and Market Access Hermosillo’s geographical positioning near the U.S. border is another factor that enhances its appeal. Proximity allows companies to effectively manage cross-border operations with minimal cultural and time zone discrepancies. According to the CEO and Founder of SupportU Hui Curtis, “Hermosillo’s location enables firms to provide robust customer support services that resonate with US clients.” This geographical advantage is not just theoretical; local BPO firms report being able to align workflows with US business hours, reducing lag and enhancing service delivery. SupportU currently assists a client doing business out of Hermosillo. Ongoing investments in infrastructure, particularly in transportation and communication networks, will bolster this advantage. Challenges on the horizon The visibility of Hermosillo as a BPO destination outside of Mexico is limited. “We need to advocate more effectively for our capabilities and the talent we offer to attract international clients,” said Arturo Fernandez, President of Sonora Global. This raises the issue of effective marketing and branding for the city’s BPO services. “I see two main challenges — the first is gaining visibility, in a sea of nearshore options.  It will be important for the Hermosillo stakeholders in private and public domains to work together to make certain their community is part of the broader Mexican / nearshore discussion.  The second one is air connections — it will be essential for the business community to lobby for more flights into the city from the U.S. and other foreign ports.  Currently, for business travelers it can be cumbersome to visit,” Ryan added. Navigating regulatory challenges is another ongoing concern. Firms must ensure compliance with local, state, and federal regulations as they expand. Streamlined regulations could play a vital role in easing entry and operation for new BPO companies. “We are digitizing a large amount of the permitting process, aiming to have a complete digital process during the next two years,” Daniel Gastélum, director of the local economic development agency said during the summit. The Road Ahead The future of Hermosillo’s BPO sector hinges on how it addresses its challenges while continuing to capitalize on its strengths. The focus on technological integration, a strong local workforce and strategic market positioning offers potential for meaningful growth. As Caire stated: “Our commitment to improving and adapting is not just about survival; it is about thriving in a competitive landscape.” With a unified approach, Hermosillo could solidify its reputation as a viable, dynamic player in the global BPO arena.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/caribbean-education-a-colonial-era-system-is-not-cutting-it/,Caribbean Education: A Colonial-Era System is Not Cutting It - Nearshore Americas,2025-03-27T17:48:46+00:00,"The Caribbean’s education system is in crisis, with recent studies showing most students struggle with mathematics, a fundamental skill in the modern world.","The Caribbean’s education system is in crisis, with recent studies showing a large majority of students struggling with mathematics, a fundamental skill in the modern world. “We are confronting a crisis … in education,” warned Lilia Burunciuc, the World Bank’s country director for the Caribbean, during a recent webinar. Unless urgent action is taken, Burunciuc said, the region’s economic future could be at risk. In the 2024 Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate exams, only 4.9% of students passed five or more subjects, including Mathematics and English . Even more concerning, just 36% passed Mathematics. But intelligence is not the problem. Caribbean students are just as capable as their global counterparts. The real issues, according to Victoria Levin, a senior economist in the World Bank’s education global practice, are outdated teaching methods and deep-rooted inequalities in educational access. Colonial Legacy Still Shapes Education The education system, shaped by colonial-era practices, still favors the privileged. Under colonial rule, elite schools were reserved for wealthy students. Today, private schools continue the tradition through selective entrance exams, a “sorting mechanism” as Levin describes it. In Trinidad and Tobago, for example, the Secondary Entrance Assessment (SEA) is a high-stakes exam for 11- to 13-year-olds seeking entry into public secondary schools. It is essentially a modern version of the British-era College Exhibition Examination, originally designed to limit access to education. SEA heavily tests students in Mathematics and Creative Writing, and only top scorers secure places in the best schools. And this isn’t unique to Trinidad — Barbados, Jamaica, and other Caribbean nations follow similar models. Even after rigorous selection, less than 80% of students pass English, and fewer than half succeed in Mathematics, Levin added. Higher Education Thrives, Yet Early Education Suffers Surprisingly, the Caribbean spends more on college education than on primary schooling. “Higher education, especially through the University of the West Indies system, has made considerable improvements over the past decade,” said Scott MacDonald, a fellow at the Caribbean Policy Consortium , in a conversation with Nearshore Americas. From his experience, graduates from these institutions are competent and well-prepared. However, many struggle due to weak foundational education. For the region to advance, MacDonald insists, reform is essential. “Competition is global,” he warns. Without fixing the education system, the Caribbean risks falling further behind. MacDonald, an expert in Caribbean economic issues, has taught political science in several institutions and authored books on the region’s development challenges. Teachers Are Leaving in Large Numbers For decades, the Caribbean has been losing teachers to better-paying countries . Jamaica alone lost 10% of its teacher workforce in just three years. In 2022, 1,538 teachers left in just nine months. Some aren’t just leaving the country — they’re leaving the profession altogether. “Some (teachers) are not migrating but leaving the profession (altogether) because they are overworked, underpaid, and undervalued,” said Dr. Garth Anderson, head of the Caribbean Teachers’ Union, at a 2023 conference in Barbados . Even newly qualified teachers in the UK, Canada, and the U.S. earn two to three times more than those in Jamaica, St. Lucia, Suriname and Trinidad, according to a University of the West Indies study. Beyond low wages, many Caribbean nations lack clear teacher recruitment and training standards. A World Bank and OECS study found that in many countries, teachers don’t receive full training until nearly a decade into their careers. The entry requirements are shockingly low. In Grenada, for example, a person can become a teacher with just five subject passes. Until 2019, new teachers received only a two-week induction program—their only formal preparation before taking charge of a classroom. Guyana’s Smart Classrooms: A Model for Change While most of the Caribbean struggles with outdated education systems, one country is taking a bold step forward. Guyana, fueled by its booming oil wealth, is embracing the future. In 2021, with support from the World Bank, Guyana introduced smart classrooms — equipping schools with smartboards, projectors, and laptops. The impact has been remarkable. At Kuru Kururu Primary School, 38 kilometers south of Georgetown, attendance has improved dramatically. “The difference is clear — students are more engaged than ever,” the head teacher told the World Bank. Teachers, too, are benefiting. With digital tools, they can refine their teaching methods and continuously improve. Before, lessons relied on static charts and worksheets. Thanks to the interactive way of learning, studying maths has become a joyful experience for students. Encouraged by this success, Guyana announced a $676 million investment in late 2024 to expand smart classrooms nationwide.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/declining-us-dollar-could-trigger-far-reaching-disruption/,Declining US Dollar Could Trigger Far-Reaching Disruption - Nearshore Americas,2025-03-25T13:53:34+00:00,"The declining US dollar looks set to pose new challenges to service exporters across Latin America. From tourism to BPOs, all are feeling the pinch.","As the US dollar weakens, Nearshore service providers are feeling the squeeze. With regional currencies rising against the greenback, many of them face the prospect of lower income or significant losses on contracts they signed with their American clients. “Yes, we have also been getting more pushback on pricing lately,” acknowledged Jeremy Stryer, co-founder of Holadev, a Queretaro, Mexico-based software development firm, most of whose clients are startups in the United States. “The constant exchange rate swings make it tough to predict pricing and revenue,” Stryer added. Mexico stands on shaky financial ground, more than any other country in the region. With exports accounting for 40% of its GDP—80% bound for the U.S. — a weakening dollar threatens to derail its dream of becoming the “China next door” for global manufacturing. After rising to new highs immediately after the election of President Donald Trump, the U.S. Dollar Index began to slide earlier this month. Already, the greenback has dropped nearly 5% from its 2025 highs. Analysts expect it to decline further in the coming months. Surprisingly, Latin American currencies had begun to strengthen even before the Dollar Index started sputtering. Argentina’s peso has surged by 40% in recent months, transforming the South American country from the cheapest destination in dollar terms to the most expensive in the region. Today, for many Argentines, living abroad now costs less than staying at home. The Mexican peso has appreciated nearly 5% against the greenback this year. Remarkably, the peso is rising even as the US imposes 25% tariffs on imports. The Brazilian real, meanwhile, has inched up by just 1.5% against the US dollar, largely influenced by high interest rates. One of the world’s top-performing currencies this year is the Colombian peso , which has surged 7.36%. The Peruvian sol has also made gains, appreciating 2.12% against the dollar, securing its place as the sixth-best-performing currency in the region. “It has been pretty crazy with respect to local currency fluctuations versus the U.S. dollar,” says Casey Halloran , CEO & Co-Founder of Costa Rican Vacations . “We are all grappling with this new reality and attempting to plan for continued shockwaves,” Halloran added. The declining US dollar “has indeed sparked concern among businesses relying on nearshoring models,” said Christian Corcino , founder and chairman at Intellisys D Corp , a nearshore IT services provider based in the Dominican Republic. But Corcino’s firm has yet to feel its ill effects. That’s largely because, as Corcino explains, the Dominican Republic’s peso has historically been closely tied to the dollar. “As the dollar’s value decreases, the Dominican peso tends to mirror that movement, so the impact on operational costs and competitiveness remains relatively neutral. Consequently, our own business, which employs personnel exclusively in the Dominican Republic, has seen minimal effect from the dollar’s recent decline.” Weak Dollar and Wage Growth Corcino noted that rising minimum wages, coupled with the decline in the USD, might prompt companies to adjust pricing or optimize resources to maintain profitability. He added that an increase in overall operational expenses for IT and BPO providers is a natural consequence of these economic shifts. In January, Costa Rica raised wages by 2.37%. Mexico implemented a 12% increase in its general minimum wage this year, while Brazil hiked it by 3.23%. Colombia’s minimum wage has nearly doubled in less than a decade. In February, Argentina enacted a 20% wage hike to help workers cope with soaring inflation. The Dominican Republic followed suit, making history with its own 20% wage increase. However, the increase in minimum wages is less likely to have a significant impact on IT workers. “For our organization, however, this shift has been less significant. Our employees — primarily software developers — already earn salaries well above the minimum wage, meaning the direct impact on payroll expenses is limited,” Corcino added. “Going forward, service providers across the region can navigate higher labor costs by focusing on specialized skill sets, improving efficiency, and delivering higher-value services, ensuring that any wage increases are balanced by productivity gains and a stronger competitive edge.” Impact on Tourism The impact of the weakened dollar could become evident in the quarterly fiscal reports of nearshore vendors later in April. However, its effects are already apparent in the tourism sector. Costa Rica’s tourism industry has suffered five consecutive months of declining foreign visitors, as the local currency, the colon, surged to historic highs. Before the pandemic, a three-day package cost around US$180 per person . Now, the same package exceeds $400—more than double the previous price. “The Colon vs. USD exchange rate has been detrimental to tourism since late 2022, when the USD to Colon rate fell from a peak of 670 to 500 (-25%),” Halloran added. By March 15, the colon had reached an all-time high of 485 per USD, as the international airports across the country showed a deep dip in foreign arrivals. “It has remained at that 500 level today, and multiple industries — agriculture, nearshoring, tourism, real estate, medical tourism, shipping — are highly concerned that a further decline in the USD’s value could lead to a loss of competitiveness,” Halloran said. Argentina Becomes Ever More Expensive President Javier Milei devalued Argentina’s currency by 54% shortly after taking office. A year later, it rebounded as the so-called “superpeso.” Meanwhile, the minimum wage jumped from 156,000 pesos at the start of 2024 to 272,000 pesos today — a 76% increase in nominal terms. In dollar value, it rose from $157 to $228. According to a report from online job platform Bumeran , the average salary sought in Argentina now stands at $1,234, surpassing the regional average. Just a year ago, it ranked among the lowest in Latin America. The stronger peso has reshaped tourism patterns. Fewer foreign tourists are visiting Argentina, while more Argentines are opting for trips abroad. In 2024, foreign tourist arrivals dropped by 8.4% to 6.2 million visitors, while the number of Argentine travelers heading overseas surged by 11.8%, reaching 8.3 million, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INDEC).

One of the suspects, Tyrone Rose, along with an unidentified co-worker, exploited their privileged system access to manipulate a loophole in StubHub’s platform, according to a complaint filed with a criminal court in Queens, New York. The American ticket marketplace had a reseller contract with Sutherland, granting its employees access to specific backend functions. Rose and his accomplice capitalized on this access to resell nearly 1,000 tickets for high-profile events, including Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour , Adele and Ed Sheeran concerts, NBA games, and the U.S. Open Tennis Championships. StubHub generates a unique URL for each ticket purchase, allowing buyers to download their tickets. Rose and his co-worker infiltrated a restricted part of the system where ticket orders were stored. They then altered the email addresses linked to these orders, redirecting the ticket download links to their associates instead of the legitimate buyers. Between June 2022 and July 2023, they stole 993 tickets across 350 orders, with the majority coming from Swift’s Eras Tour, thanks to its record-breaking demand. When StubHub uncovered the fraud, it swiftly terminated its contract with Sutherland and alerted law enforcement. New York police have arrested Tyrone Rose and Shamara Simmons, while a third suspect remains on the run. A fourth accomplice died before facing charges. Rose and Simmons are now confronting serious charges, including grand larceny, computer tampering, and conspiracy, which could result in prison sentences ranging from 3 to 15 years. Could it be Avoided? The case has ignited major concerns about security oversight at Sutherland, leaving the global BPO firm scrambling to contain the fallout. Jared Koll, a CX advisor based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, believes Sutherland could have averted the incident had it implemented “AI-anomaly solutions.” These tools monitor agents’ behavior and flag high-risk actions, such as accessing unauthorized databases. “Further, geo-fencing and device security could have stopped these agents from accessing unauthorized systems in the first place, through permissions and device access controls.” After discovering the fraud, StubHub promptly issued a press release and announced the contract termination. However, Sutherland has remained silent, neither making a public statement nor responding to Nearshore Americas’ email inquiry. “We don’t know the internal steps SGS is taking, but if we were advising them, we’d expect a full post-mortem and an RFP process for upgraded security infrastructure,” Koll said when asked about potential next steps. “If you are a Jamaica-based BPO that is NOT SGS, you should launch a full messaging push, publicly highlighting the compliance improvements you’ve made since 2024.” Jamaica’s Reaction According to Radio Jamaica, Wayne Sinclair, president of the Global Services Association of Jamaica (GSAJ), said the incident has cast a long shadow over Jamaica’s BPO industry. This is partly because the accused are Jamaican nationals who likely exploited the trust Sutherland Global placed in them. Sinclair called for hefty penalties on employees who engage in such crimes. “Such (punishments) will act as a real deterrent to people who may be thinking about doing this because I think right now there’s a sense that it’s worth the risk.” However, the GSAJ President emphasized that all BPOs have enforced stringent security protocols to safeguard client data. He stressed that this breach occurred due to a betrayal of trust by employees. “Our BPOs have strong, independent relationships with clients, reinforced by frequent client visits to our locations and rigorous inspections of our physical and IT security protocols and processes.” “The confidence of our collective client base in our service is rooted in these trusted personal relationships.” News Editor for Nearshore Americas, Narayan Ammachchi is a career journalist with a decade of experience in politics and international business.

Last week, the U.S. revoked his visa. The state department told NPR visa records are confidential and cannot be discussed publicly. Arias said workers at the U.S. embassy in Costa Rica informed him the action had been taken over his close ties to the Chinese government. Arias has been critical of U.S. President Donald Trump and earlier this year compared him to a “Roman emperor.” The Nobel Laureate believes those comments may have led to the decision to revoke his visa. A Shift in Policy Signalling to Arias that he is no longer welcome in the U.S. is the most high-profile example of a noticeable shift in policy from the Trump administration. Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a memo to diplomats asking them to search through the social media accounts of visa applicants. This follows an executive order signed by Trump that jump-started an effort to deport individuals from the country who have “hostile attitudes” toward American values. Trump has also inked an order to reduce antisemitism that has been used to justify the deportation of students protesting against Israel’s military actions in Gaza. On Thursday, Inside Higher Ed reported the state department has modified or revoked more than 600 student visas since the order was signed. Populism in LatAm The left wing in Latin America has historically opposed the influence exerted by the United States in the region. Arias’ goal for peace in 1986 was not helped by the U.S. funding of the right-wing Contra rebels that were causing instability in Nicaragua. After years of political dominance, the left capitulated when the Conservative Wave hit Latin America about 10 years ago, bringing an influx of right-wing leadership to numerous countries. But the branding, this time, was not quite the same as the conservative administrations of years past. Raquel Chanto, a Costa Rican political scientist and Oxford University Ph.D. candidate, cited a global decline in trust as being responsible for the rise of populist leaders in an interview with Yoriko Yasukawa, vice president of the Foundation for Global Governance and Sustainability. “Trust is the philosopher’s stone of political systems, something you can translate into results through legitimacy, buy-in and willingness to cooperate and engage in political agreements,” Chanto said. “Overall, people trust systems that they believe are fair, consistent, open and responsive; where they feel included and heard, and their needs are addressed. That is to say that citizens trust the good government.” Rhetoric vs. Reality Teamstation AI CEO and Co-Founder Lonnie McRorey has lived in Mexico for nine years while operating his nearshore staffing system company. “I think more professionals are trying to stay here — they’re not so eager to go to the U.S.,” he said. “But, look, the dollar still has a very powerful way. There are people here willing to risk everything in their lives to make $300.” McRorey said that the disparity among Mexican nationals creates an interesting dynamic, with the ability for many to have a quality of life at or surpassing what the U.S. offers while still seeing abject poverty and citizens trying to escape the country. “There’s high taxes, no access to health care,” he said of the U.S. “Believe it or not, quality of life in LatAm is better than in the U.S. in many ways.” Latin American reliance on economic support from the United States has waned in recent years as China begins to exert influence in the region. Arias, while Costa Rica’s president, established diplomatic relations with China in 2007. The BRICS economic bloc, originally a partnership between Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, announced in January it was adding nine “partner” nations, which included Bolivia. Additionally, BRICS says it has received interest from Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Uruguay and Venezuela to join the partnership. ‘Sympathy for the Devil’ The U.S. military is taking notice. A report released by the Army-operated Foreign Military Studies Office states that there is an increase in the number of Latin American countries looking to develop significant overseas relations . “This development signals that dictatorships in Latin America see the BRICS grouping as an economic and political lifeline amid difficult economic and diplomatic moments. Relatedly, the inclusion of a greater number of Latin American countries in BRICS will bring China and Russia further into the Western hemisphere, where both have been increasing their influence of late,” the report states. Similarly, a report issued by Irene Mia, a senior fellow for Latin America at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the U.S. should be wary of celebrating its near-term policy victories , such as tackling drug trafficking, before it fully realizes some of the long-term effects its rhetoric toward Latin America may bring. “Without concrete measures to support Latin America’s economic growth and diversification, and to bolster its Democratic institutions, China will remain a dominant economic force in the region,” Mia wrote. “Additionally, trade tariffs and deportations of undocumented migrants to their countries of origin — particularly through the economic blow of lost remittances — will wreak havoc on Latin American economies, making China’s trade and investment even more attractive.” Comment Name *  Email *  Website   Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/tnvisa-scrutiny-rising-under-trump-2-0/,TN Visa Scrutiny Rising Under Trump 2.0 - Nearshore Americas,2025-03-18T12:38:21+00:00,"Jasmine Mooney, a 35-year-old Canadian business consultant, recently spent 11 days under detention by U.S. immigration officials after attempting to enter the country through Mexico with a TN visa application.

Three months prior, Mooney’s work visa was revoked while attempting to travel to Los Angeles over what she claimed was a paperwork issue that Vancouver airport customs officers would not elaborate on. Her attempt at reentering the country with a new TN application at the Mexican border ended with her being sent to three different detention facilities in a process she later described as “a deeply disturbing psychological experiment.” According to immigration attorneys nationwide, Mooney’s experience is becoming increasingly common. It is another example of the increasing scrutiny of current TN visa holders and applicants under U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. Sudden difficulties with the TN visa are in stark contrast with the relatively smooth and easy pathway reported on many times in previous coverage in Nearshore Americas over the years. One of the ‘Easiest’ Ways to Come to America The TN visa was formed in 1994 under the North American Free Trade Agreement as a way for Mexican and Canadian citizens to fast-track entry into the United States for in-demand jobs that mostly require bachelor’s degrees, such as pharmacists, dentists, school teachers, engineers, and computer systems analysts. Mexican citizens have long enjoyed the benefits of the TN Visa program, which sets the Latin American country apart from its southern neighbors who are not included in the initiative. During Trump’s first term, immigration negotiations with Canada and Mexico took a backseat to more business-minded ventures. Considered a nonimmigrant visa, the TN program was responsible for bringing more than 33,000 employees to the country in 2022. In 2020, the program continued under NAFTA’s successor, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which made no changes to the requirements of the TN process, likely due to its effectiveness in bringing educated workers to the country and having very few documented instances of abuse or fraud. But that isn’t stopping immigration officials from cracking down on the application process after Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 titled “Protecting the American People Against Invasion.” “We’re seeing a trend where it is becoming harder for some Mexican nationals under some job descriptions — engineers, animal breeders and consultants — are having a harder time getting their applications approved,” said Ingrid Perez, an employment-based immigration attorney who founded IBP Immigration Law in Orlando, Florida. “There are reports recently that in Mexico TN adjudications aren’t very consistent, and a lot of times that has to do with the people adjudicating the visas and the guidance they received.” A Year Away From Review In early 2026, the U.S. Trade Representative is expected to produce a report to Congress on the workings of the USMCA as part of a mandated joint review between the North American countries. That review will begin on July 1, 2026. “We’re not really sure what could happen with TN visas next year,” Perez said. “The America First Trade Policy is centered around protecting U.S. workers and U.S. jobs — and that revision they’re going to be doing next year is an opportunity for the Trump administration to perhaps have a really great impact on TN visas.” Perez said many immigration attorneys expect the increased scrutiny to continue through 2026. Some anticipate greater compliance requirements, stricter documentation requirements, and a renewed focus on job verification. She said the new administration may also use the highly successful TN program as a bargaining chip to force concessions from Canada or Mexico. “It’s kind of hard to know, exactly,” she said. Sophie Alcorn, founder of Palo Alto, California-based Alcorn Immigration Law , said changes could happen with the TN visa program and others like it before the review concludes in 2026. “In other immigration categories, we are seeing policy changes that affect the adjudication standards even though the law remains unchanged, so it is theoretically possible that TN enforcement or interpretation could change in 2025 before any potential actual changes to the treaty could happen,” she said. Processing Times Remain in Check While denials may be rising, processing times have remained relatively unchanged for TN visa applicants aside from a change in law interpretation by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services regarding its premium processing service, which costs $2,805. “Instead of calendar days, now it’s business days,” Alcorn explained. “So instead of 15 calendar days to get a response, now it’s about three weeks to get a response.” Alcorn said she has heard anecdotal reports of premium processing snags with TN visas, and she personally has experienced the issue with extraordinary ability Green Card cases that were slated for processing by early January but are just now receiving responses. “In those situations, our clients are getting refunds of their premium processing filing fees,” she said. Perez said if the processing struggles spill over from premium into regular processing, it could bring significant issues to the immigration system and disproportionately hurt small businesses. “If it’s a large employer hiring a large number of people, they might not feel the pains of increased processing times as much, but these employers who maybe rely on one TN professional, they’ll hurt,” she said. “It’s going to be important for businesses to have a backup plan and understanding that perhaps immigration doesn’t work with our timeline; we have to work with theirs.” Attorneys are also speculating whether the large-scale government layoffs occurring under Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency could add fuel to the processing-time fire in the future. Alcorn said the immigration system, with its self-funded structure through applicants paying most of the costs, may be insulated from those potential effects. “The other question I have is: Will the administration make any subsequent announcements on immigration policies to support companies that are bringing manufacturing to the United States in response to tariffs? Will there be any streamlined immigration support for those countries to be able to do business here?” Alcorn inquired. Alcorn said questions such as those arose after the notable fracture in immigration philosophy following Musk’s promotion of HB-1 visas amid Trump’s push for an America-first business model. “There are things signaling that this government is proactively trying to recruit really smart people into the country for entrepreneurship and manufacturing.” Comment Name *  Email *  Website   Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

Launched in 2015, Alto transitioned from a remote-first staffing company into a comprehensive tech talent platform. “The merger helps us to scale our mission,” said Juan Salas, co-founder and CTO at Alto. “We built Alto on the belief that Latin America could be a driving force in the AI revolution. I’m proud of what we created, and excited to see that vision continue through Revelo,” Salas said, confirming that both he and his co-founder, Pablo Baldomá Jones , would gain a role in Revelo. “Together, we’re building an end-to-end solution that removes the friction from hiring in Latin America,” Baldomá Jones said. When asked how many Latin American professionals they had placed with U.S. companies, Baldomá estimated “the figure could be somewhere between 800 and 1,000.” Alto’s client list includes 24 Hour Fitness, Anytime Fitness, and BBVA. During the interview, both co-founders acknowledged the sharp increase in demand for AI talent . “The demand for AI-literate developers — especially those who can contribute to complex post-training work on large language models — is accelerating.” The acquisition significantly expands Revelo’s presence in the region and marks its fifth deal in just 30 months, underscoring its rapid growth strategy. Revelo stated that, following the acquisition, the total number of professionals on its platform has reached 400,000. According to Revelo, companies are competing to secure talent capable of enhancing large language models for advanced tasks such as coding. Hiring related to large language model training accounted for 22% of Revelo’s revenue in 2024, according to Spanish news outlets, and analysts believe this share is likely to increase. This growth is driven by companies developing their own AI models and seeking specialized engineers and datasets to train them. They require human input to interact with machines and validate the generated code. “It is simply impossible to hire developers at scale without the help of platforms like Alto,” Salas said, with Baldomá Jones adding that hiring Latin American talent involves extensive backend processes such as identifying and vetting candidates. Juan Salas, co-founder of Alto, dismissed the notion that automation in software development would diminish the demand for IT talent. Instead, he emphasized that companies are actually scaling up their operations and increasing their need for skilled professionals.

The $15.2 billion deal will make NTT Data a wholly owned subsidiary, giving NTT full control over its IT services arm. This move builds on a 2022 restructuring that placed NTT’s overseas operations under NTT Data, establishing it as the centerpiece of the group’s international IT solutions business. However, overlapping capital structures have hindered fast decision-making , especially around major data center investments driven by rising demand for generative AI. NTT President and CEO Akira Shimada cited governance challenges, including conflicts of interest from dual stock listings and a convoluted decision-making process, as key reasons for the acquisition. He emphasized that the new structure will allow better accountability and smoother allocation of management resources. NTT Data’s core services include IT solutions and data center operations for domestic and global clients. Its overseas presence is particularly strong in Latin America , where it supports public and private sector digital transformation in countries like Brazil, Argentina, and Chile, offering solutions in finance, healthcare, and smart cities.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/argentina-pulls-back-from-the-edge-as-mileis-shock-therapy-delivers/,Milei’s Shock Therapy Puts Argentina on a Path of Recovery - Nearshore Americas,2025-04-30T18:27:07+00:00,Argentina’s battered economy is finally showing signs of revival. President Javier Milei’s radical “shock therapy” is beginning to bear fruit.,"Argentina’s battered economy is finally showing signs of revival. President Javier Milei’s radical “ shock therapy ” is beginning to bear fruit. The fiscal rebound is already visible in the stock market — often viewed as the pulse of the economy. The MERVAL index, Argentina’s benchmark, surged by a staggering 172% in local currency terms in 2024. Economic activity is also gaining traction. As of February, output rose 5.7% year-on-year — marking the fourth consecutive month of growth and the strongest pace since June 2022. The IMF expects the country to register 5.5% growth for 2025. According to President Milei, the economy is expanding at an ‘unadjusted’ annual rate of 10%. This turnaround didn’t happen by chance. It came only after Milei took aim at two of Argentina’s most entrenched problems: a volatile currency and runaway inflation. The Shock Therapy During his election campaign, Milei wielded a symbolic chainsaw, vowing to slash public spending. Once in office, he fulfilled his promise. Austerity hit like a hammer blow. Within months, real public spending was slashed by 30%, as the President cut subsidies for gas, electricity, and other public utilities. More than 36,000 public sector employees were laid off. Twelve ministries were eliminated. Four others — Education, Labor, Social Development, and Culture — were merged into a single super-ministry called Human Capital. Initially, the shock therapy lived up to its name — shocking even the president. For weeks, Buenos Aires’ international airport appeared eerily empty. Trains and subways fell silent. Garbage piled up on the streets as thousands of public workers went on strike in protest. Yet beneath the mounting social tension, the economic logic began to take hold. Inflation, which had soared to nearly 300% annually , finally began to fall. Next came a wave of deregulation. The Milei administration eliminated state controls, including those on house rent and consumer prices. As supply increased, rents dropped over a matter of months. “I lived a year in Argentina in the mid-2010s, and the economy at that time was in a terrible state — shortages, currency controls, out-of-control inflation, clogged ports — you name it. I was not optimistic about it ever turning around,” said Fergus Hodgson, Director at Econ Americas , a US-based financial consultancy, and author of The Latin America Red Pill . Hodgson, however, disagrees with labeling Milei’s policies as “shock therapy.” “He cannot — and has not — enacted the kind of shock therapy he would ideally like to. Still, he has generated many positive outcomes in just a year and a half.” Devaluing Currency Still, many economists argue Milei’s decision to devalue the peso was a textbook case of shock therapy. The president devalued the official exchange rate by more than 50% — a bold move to align it more closely with the black-market “blue dollar” rate. Rather than defending the peso through artificial means, the government allowed market forces to set its value. This began restoring investor confidence and gradually squeezed out parallel currency markets. The result was dramatic. By the end of 2024, inflation had plunged to 118% — a drop of 44.5 percentage points in just one year. The decline continued. By March 2025, annual inflation had fallen to 55.9%. Projections suggest it could dip below 30% before the year ends. To attract foreign investment, his government introduced the RIGI regime — a landmark policy that offers 30 years of fiscal and regulatory stability, tax cuts, and trade incentives for large-scale projects (above $200 million). The framework protects investors against adverse policy shifts and guarantees compensation if these protections are violated. By February 2025, the results were beginning to show. At least 10 energy projects worth a combined $11.593 billion had been submitted under the new regime. In mining, six projects totaling nearly $15 billion were in the pipeline. In April, Milei secured a $20 billion loan from the IMF to support his market-oriented reforms and the dismantling of years of currency and capital controls.

However, like many other industries that AI experts had promised would bring transformation, the widespread layoffs have yet to come. The business process outsourcing market has ballooned in growth over the past 15 years, a trend that most analysts predict will continue in the short term. A report by Kimberly Tan, investing partner at Andreessen Horowitz, published this year shows the BPO industry has already surpassed a $300 billion market cap on a global scale and is expected to surpass $525 billion by 2030. But the big question is: How will that increase in market share be accomplished? Artificial intelligence will be part of the process, but the question on many executives’ minds is whether that growth comes from AI replacing or improving paid employees. Jeff Pappas, senior managing director at Newmark, has spent over 25 years working with international BPO operators to find real estate suitable for their needs. He hasn’t seen a drop in the demand for office space. Furthermore, the clients he’s spoken with aren’t anticipating major industry shifts due to the continued advancement of AI technology. “Within BPOs, there’s going to be some areas that are more affected than others,” Pappas said. “But there are certain areas where it’s just not going to affect anything — legal, customer service and sales — those are areas that rely on physical, personal interaction.” What’s the Truth? What isn’t? Finding verified information on how artificial intelligence has changed the landscape of global businesses since the AI boom of 2020 and 2021 can be difficult. Basic research through search engines produces blog posts and information showing artificial intelligence adoption rates as high as 50% among global industries. However, results from trusted sources show much lower market saturation. A report from Goldman Sachs at the conclusion of 2024 suggested that only about 6% of American businesses have implemented some form of artificial intelligence into their operations. Pappas said he believes AI will have an increased effect on the BPO industry in the coming years, but questioned whether or not that means eliminating jobs, or more specifically, in the real estate industry, office space. “In contact centers, typically we’re looking at 50 to 80 square feet per person, while in the legal category, it’s probably 175 square feet per person,” he said. “We have all these different metrics to determine how much space an operation needs. If you use AI, we can do everything you want to do in 72 square feet instead of 80, so there’s an efficiency factor where artificial intelligence can squeeze things a bit more.” Pappas said AI’s beauty is its ability to help business owners find cost savings in previously unexplored areas. “You can’t squeeze blood from a turnip,” he said. “Pay is pay, taxes are taxes, insurance is insurance. But AI can look in other areas to help make adjustments that might be needed.” Bringing in Artificial Quality Critics of the global business process outsourcing industry have referred to its operations as a “race to the bottom,” citing the emphasis clients often put on cost-cutting measures over quality of service. However, that trend may face reversal as artificial intelligence becomes adopted across the industry. Automated quality assurance programs are gaining popularity among BPO operators , who use the software to receive instant employee performance feedback. Other predictive analytics programs have allowed BPOs to forecast when higher call volumes will occur during the week, allowing management to alter staffing schedules as needed. Using these types of AI can increase profits and quality of service while adding little overhead to maintain the momentum. “We’re so people-heavy that AI coming in and changing everything quickly just isn’t very likely,” Pappas said. “Maybe we’ll see some changes, but we need people. And the (BPO operators) I’ve talked to — AI hasn’t really affected them yet.” Comment Name *  Email *  Website   Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.    It’s refreshing to see AI being used not to replace people, but to *support* them—enhancing quality and efficiency without losing the human touch.

That experience opened","When Debra Fraser first came to Jamaica from Canada in 2000 on a church mission trip, she never imagined she’d play a growing role in the Caribbean’s fast-growing business process outsourcing industry. After two years of volunteering, Fraser joined Vistaprint in 2003 as an HR leader, helping the company expand into Jamaica. That experience opened her eyes to the hurdles foreign businesses often face when setting up shop in the region, from recruiting local talent to managing wage expectations and understanding government incentives. “Vistaprint did a fantastic job, but it was so much work, trial and error,” Fraser said. “It kind of developed a desire in me to help other companies to not have to go through that.” By 2010, she had started her own call center, which grew to about 50 employees before financial limitations forced her to reposition. She launched an HR outsourcing firm , assisting other companies with their Caribbean operations, often stepping in as the official employer of record. Her company has since had a major impact on Jamaica’s BPO sector, which has grown from around 5,000 workers twenty years ago to about 60,000 today. As a part of that growth, her team recruited over 1,100 employees for ibex, a major BPO company. From the ground up Entrepreneurship is essential across the Caribbean, but it comes along with well-established risks. Small- and medium-sized enterprises make up 99.5% of businesses and provide about 60% of formal jobs, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Nevertheless, these businesses often struggle to get financing, secure collateral, or tap into robust capital markets. “Banks want assets. If you don’t have property, it’s hard to grow,” Fraser said. “There aren’t many grants or angel investors here. I’ve thought about registering my business elsewhere just to access capital.” Jamaica has improved its business climate in recent years and now ranks 71st in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index. After four decades of little to no improvement, the island is expected to see 1 to 2% annual growth over the medium term, according to World Bank Group. Mortgage rates have come down from 17% to about 8%, and the Jamaican dollar is seeing some stability amid a weakening U.S. dollar, Fraser said. Still, many startups have no choice but to bootstrap. Fraser considers herself lucky that she was able to use family-owned land as leverage to secure funding for her endeavors. Today, her company serves clients around the world and specializes in remote-first hiring. This approach eliminates the need for expensive office space by finding skilled workers for businesses that operate virtually — a trend that gained momentum during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Our clients cut 70% off labor costs by hiring in Jamaica,” she said. “And they’re getting high-quality workers with years of BPO experience. It’s a no-brainer.” Fraser believes smaller firms like hers are well-suited to succeed, especially as larger BPO providers deal with increasing costs. She also points to rising competition from gig economy platforms like Fiverr and Upwork, which attract Caribbean freelancers but don’t contribute to local tax systems. “The gig economy is already here,” Fraser said. “But if you’re not on a payroll, you can’t access benefits like Jamaica’s housing trust. That’s a missed opportunity for both workers and the country.” The fight to stay competitive Nearby, countries like Trinidad and Tobago are pouring money into the sector — more than $245 million — to create thousands of new jobs. With strong English language skills and proximity to the U.S., the Caribbean takes advantage of the typical nearshore selling points. But Fraser warns that to stay competitive, the region needs better policies, more funding opportunities, and stronger digital infrastructure. “The labor is here, the skills are here,” she said. “What we need now is better support for the people building the future from the ground up.” According to the Global Services Association of Jamaica, about 70 companies make up the country’s BPO sector. And while some worry artificial intelligence could replace jobs, GSAJ President Wayne Sinclair believes technology could improve productivity and lead to new roles. The global services sector remains a major job engine, with a 61.5% jump in employment over the past eight years, according to Minister of Industry, Investment and Commerce Senator Aubyn Hill.

LatAm Heads Back to Office - Nearshore Americas,2025-01-21T18:39:50+00:00,"Across Latin America, the remote work revolution appears to be grinding to a halt.","Across Latin America, the remote work revolution appears to be grinding to a halt. As 2025 progresses, offices are reclaiming their dominance, and the work-from-home era looks increasingly like a fleeting pandemic experiment. The region is now leading the world in five-day in-person work, according to a recent JLL real estate consultancy study. Six out of ten companies in the region have already ditched remote arrangements, pulling their workforce back to desks. Peru stands out for its tough stance—remote work is almost extinct. Barely 10% of service sector workers still work from home. Meanwhile, other countries are following suit: Colombia sees 72% of its workforce back in offices, Brazil 60%, Chile 56%, and Mexico 54%. In Peru, of the 764 companies that adopted remote work during the pandemic, a staggering 90% plan to fully return to in-office setups by early 2025, according to ResumeBuilder.com . Real estate lobbying, unmotivated employees, and strict government regulations are collectively casting a shadow over the future of remote work. There are cultural factors also, stated Mark Beyer, founder of Mybey Ventures . “Supervisors in Latin America often prefer direct oversight. Remote work disrupts this dynamic, leaving managers uneasy about accountability and day-to-day control.” In Mexico, many firms have ended remote work due to concerns about decreased productivity and difficulties in maintaining employee oversight. “The culture in Mexico is not one of a lot of trust. Companies feel that during the Pandemic many employees started to abuse the home office situation, not being controlled by the management,” said Peter Kroll , Country Manager for Novacomp in Mexico. “Productivity of many workers went down when working 100% remotely and companies believe this is because there were too many distractions working from home.” Some countries introduced remote work regulations to benefit employees, but ironically, these measures indirectly pressured companies to abandon remote working altogether. In Mexico, for instance, government required companies to pay for home office essentials—chairs, internet, electricity—and take responsibility for employee health and safety at home. “This is difficult to implement,” says Kroll. “Many companies simply don’t want to bear these risks.” The primary argument, says Dionisio Chiuratto Agourakis , CEO of JAI , a São Paulo-based company that offers AI support to boost productivity, is that in-person work is more productive than remote work. “This is especially relevant for junior employees, who miss out on the benefits of being in a physical workplace, such as learning from colleagues, observing workplace dynamics, and improving through direct interactions.” A less-discussed but growing issue, Agourakis said, was  the trend of employees holding multiple full-time remote jobs simultaneously—sometimes as many as three or four—without informing their employers. This behaviour, widely discussed by employees on Reddit and Twitter, has made companies more skeptical about remote work, he added. “In Brazil, some organizations implemented strict measures such as requiring webcams and microphones to be on during work hours, or monitoring keyboard and mouse activity, to ensure productivity.” The Challenge of Retaining Staff With the decline in remote work, retaining employees will become a significant challenge for companies already grappling with talent shortages. In late 2024, workforce analytics firm Revelio uncovered a troubling trend: return-to-office (RTO) policies were shrinking workforces in many organizations. Analyzing hiring and attrition data from public U.S. companies, Revelio found a stark contrast. Since June 2022, when RTO mandates gained momentum, firms offering flexible work have grown their workforce by 1.6%, compared to just 1% growth for companies enforcing in-office attendance. “Yes, companies are aware that they will lose precious talent. But it was inevitable” Agourakis added. Ultimately, companies may need to explore ways to adapt teleworking model to improve employee retention. In a similar JLL survey conducted in 2024 , 62% of respondents said they may plan to create a network of workspaces closer to employees’ homes, aiming to make the transition more appealing and retain talent.

In","Multinational companies appear to be hitting pause on their future plans amid growing fears of a potential trade war. Geopolitical friction is already disrupting global supply chains and leaving customer service teams scrambling to manage the fallout. This is one of the key discussion areas at next week’s CXOutsourcers ‘Mindshare” Forum , in Munich, Germany. In this context of uncertainty, we sat down with Peter Ryan , founder of Ryan Strategic Advisory, to delve into the current opportunities and challenges shaping the global customer experience (CX) landscape. Ryan is a founding member of CXOutsourcers, which annually hosts the Mindshare Event — an industry gathering focused on assessing the global CX and BPO sectors. Designed specifically for Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) professionals, the forum is geared toward empowering C-suite executives with research and strategic insights to drive business performance. More than 120 CX leaders from across the globe are expected to attend. Below are excerpts from the interview with Peter Ryan. NSAM: What advice would you give to contact center providers who are heavily reliant on U.S. customers, especially now that the geopolitical order has shifted under President Donald Trump? Ryan: First, I’d say — don’t panic. Anyone considering the U.S. market shouldn’t abandon it entirely. Yes, there’s a lot of confusion right now. The next few months are going to be political — shaping the direction of what the U.S. plans to do, and how its trade and tariff policies play out. But at this stage, it’s anyone’s guess. There’s still immense value in the U.S. from an outsourcing perspective. So, I’d tell anyone eyeing the U.S. as a potential market: stay clear-eyed, observe closely, but don’t write it off. NSAM: Contact center providers serving U.S. customers seem to be in serious trouble these days, especially with the dollar index plunging to 99. Anything below 100 could deal a devastating blow to providers that are heavily dependent on U.S. clients. How do you suggest they tackle this crisis? Ryan: Well, there’s a lot of volatility out there. Strategic planning is key. Providers must work with people who understand currency fluctuations and risk management — people who can hedge against currency risk using the right tools. Now, while the dollar has appreciated and other currencies have weakened, that may actually benefit offshore providers. For buyers in the U.S., outsourcing just became cheaper. So, depending on how the currency arbitrage plays out, this could increase the appeal of offshore destinations — making U.S. companies more inclined to spend. NSAM: You once told us that most people still prefer speaking to a human rather than a machine in contact centers. So, AI bots wouldn’t be as successful as we initially expected. But these days, many BPOs are deploying chatbots — and laying off human agents. Do you still hold that view, or should service providers adapt and embrace AI? Ryan: I don’t believe there’s a massive wave of agents losing their jobs due to AI. Our research shows that while there has been some displacement, it’s mostly roles that were bound to be automated anyway — like changing an address, or resetting a password. What we’re really seeing now is AI being used to enable agents, not replace them. Yes, some contact centers are moving toward automation or AI-driven models. But I don’t think we’ll see a full-scale shift — at least not in the near or medium term. Maybe in the long term, depending on how you define that. There’s been a lot of hype over the last two and a half years about what AI can do. But when it comes to generative AI in customer service, the hype hasn’t fully matched the delivery — at least, not yet. NSAM: Stock prices of major voice-based BPO providers have taken a hit in recent months. Investors seem to believe that AI bots will take over the customer service industry. What’s your take on this, as an industry analyst? Ryan: You have to look at what triggered the drop in stock prices. It started when a Scandinavian fintech company announced they were shifting all customer service work to AI bots. Naturally, that spooked the outsourcing market. But interestingly, that same fintech recently reversed its decision — bringing the work back to human agents. Why? Because the AI tech simply wasn’t mature enough to deliver the kind of customer experience they needed. So yes, stock price movements are a concern, and investor expectations are clearly a big part of that. But I think we’re now seeing a rebalancing — a recalibration — of how the market perceives AI’s role in CX. NSAM: We recently met the owner of a contact center firm in India. He suggested that service providers should look for countries where agents can speak multiple languages. That way, they can serve a diverse customer base from a single site. He also said new technologies make it easier to handle different accents. Do you think that’s a useful strategy? Ryan: It’s definitely a valid suggestion. In fact, there are already several multilingual hubs around the world doing exactly that. We also have advanced tools now — from automatic translation to accent neutralization — that make multilingual service much more seamless. But the key thing to understand is: there’s no one-size-fits-all strategy. The right approach depends on the company, the industry it’s in, and the markets it serves. So while multilingual hubs are valuable, companies need to align their CX strategy with their specific business goals and customer demographics. NSAM: Which country do you think is making a significant mark in the CX services sector globally? Ryan: The Philippines is doing a fantastic job — as is India. These two are consistently among the most highly rated and preferred destinations by buyers, according to our research. South Africa and Egypt are also standouts. In Latin America, Mexico is a strong favorite, along with Colombia. And in the Caribbean, Jamaica has always impressed us. I was genuinely pleased with what I saw recently during an event hosted by the Jamaican outsourcing sector. In Central and Eastern Europe, there are great success stories coming out of Albania, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria. So, I wouldn’t say there’s one country that’s head and shoulders above the rest. Instead, what we’re seeing is each country carving out its own niche — finding its sweet spot in the industry. The key is that quality locations are stepping up, refining their game, and striving to deliver the best experiences and outcomes. NSAM: What can these executives expect to learn if they participate in the CXOutsourcers’ event in Munich? Why is it important not to miss it? Ryan: This event is crucial for anyone who wants to understand the future of CX — and how outsourcers must pivot to stay competitive through 2025 and into 2026.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/aws-mexico-explained-a-new-tech-cornerstone-in-mexico/,AWS Mexico Explained: A New Tech Cornerstone in Mexico - Nearshore Americas,2025-02-06T16:55:16+00:00,"""I believe the new Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud 'region' will bring a lot to Mexico and all its industries,"" says David Victoria, a Senior Cloud Architect for Caylent in Latin America and one of the main ambassadors of Amazon's newest technology project. ""However, I still think there's many things to ask Santa for."" Querétaro","“I believe the new Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud ‘region’ will bring a lot to Mexico and all its industries,” says David Victoria , a Senior Cloud Architect for Caylent in Latin America and one of the main ambassadors of Amazon’s newest technology project. “However, I still think there’s many things to ask Santa for.” Querétaro is the second Latin American city to host an AWS Region, following São Paulo. This Region, with three Availability Zones accessible via the API code mx-central-1 , will offer low-latency cloud services, enhanced data sovereignty, and increased opportunities for digital transformation. It expands upon Amazon’s existing Local Zone (smaller-scale data center deployments) in Querétaro and Points of Presence (PoPs, which are caché storing edge locations) in Monterrey, Puebla, Tlalnepantla, Tlaquepaque, Torreón and Querétaro. The news comes at a time when costs for software development in Mexico are increasingly becoming less of an advantage. Fortunately, the AWS region addresses the remaining two factors of the “Iron Triangle” in nearshoring IT services. With cost competitiveness fading, the industry is now prioritizing faster delivery and higher-quality end products. According to Mexican Tech Expert Enrique Cortés-Rello , AWS Mexico has contributed significantly to boost the region’s tech ecosystem. “It consolidates the country as the region’s main technology hub. More cloud computing infrastructure means a stronger appeal for business and a wider array of available computing tools for companies, entrepreneurs, governments, and academia.” The US tech giant has recently announced plans to invest $5 billion in Mexico over the next 15 years. This investment is expected to create 7,000 jobs and contribute $10 billion to the country’s GDP. This investment also promises to boost the nation’s digital future. The cloud initiative’s hardware and software are being implemented alongside a comprehensive community building program and robust sustainability protocols and projects. These initiatives demonstrate the company’s awareness of protests in Latin America surrounding data center deployment and environmental concerns. According to David, the program includes: Most sustainability strategies appear to have a long-term focus, leaving uncertainty about whether AWS can respond swiftly and effectively to the pressing challenges in cloud and AI development. That said, the AWS Mexico Region has introduced initiatives to promote STEM education and provide targeted support for women and children pursuing careers in IT. Among the most significant efforts is a $300,000 fund dedicated to advancing technology-focused community projects in Querétaro. “In the past, businesses had to purchase expensive hardware, install it on-premises, and maintain it themselves,” says David. “With cloud computing, companies can rent infrastructure on demand, scaling up or down as needed, without large upfront costs.” AWS Availability Zones provide a robust platform for complex code loading, execution, testing, and development. This results in faster application performance, a better user experience, and new opportunities for industries dependent on real-time computing. These benefits extend beyond Mexico; having AWS data centers geographically closer should reduce friction in client experience and enhance software design capabilities. AWS offers Amazon Connect, a cloud-based call center solution that streamlines communication and improves service quality. David explained that, with the impact of a local AWS Region on the available digital infrastructure landscape, call centers can anticipate lower call drop rates and improved voice quality, reduced latency for real-time customer interactions, and increased scalability, enabling businesses to adjust resources according to demand. For developers and tech companies exporting services internationally, utilizing a local cloud region offers numerous advantages. “We say ‘cloud is your new local’,” David remarks, emphasizing that the infrastructure provided by AWS includes a sophisticated, extensive, and unique coding toolkit designed to support the majority of software development needs. From a business perspective, this translates to faster development cycles, achieved through testing and deploying software closer to end-users; lower costs compared to hosting services in distant regions; and facilitated global expansion via a multi-region cloud architecture. Both providers and consumers in the nearshore model will benefit from the ability to extend their service offerings to industries demanding high data sovereignty or low-latency standards previously unattainable. Organizations in sectors like banking, government, and healthcare can now leverage cloud services to achieve their objectives, overcoming regulatory hurdles that previously mandated in-country data hosting. However, there comes David’s most serious critique of the AWS Region: “Unfortunately, it doesn’t come with all the functions”. Take Hardware Security Modules : a high-level, coding-heavy security procedure used to record, archive and utilize sensitive data. It is now standard for a lot of licensing on cybersecurity. “Yet it is not available to utilize for the AWS Mexico Region. It is a function of data infrastructure that has been deployed in other AWS regions.” Cortés-Rello explained it’s common for different cloud service regions to include different services. “It depends on hardware and software implemented on the region’s data centers. For example, US Regions provide services aligned with HIPAA (US health regulation standards). That is not that important for us.” David expressed his hope that this exclusion is only temporary. He emphasized the lack of logic in omitting high-end security functions, particularly given the rise of increasingly complex cyberattacks and widespread concerns about data safety, especially when deploying technology designed to create faster, better products that aim to bolster digital sovereignty. AWS’s expansion into Mexico is more than just an investment in infrastructure—it’s a gateway to digital transformation for businesses of all sizes. While the project may not yet be flawless, and while it may present sustainability challenges, it undeniably demonstrates that long-term, focused private investment can, at times, drive greater resources toward digital transformation than government initiatives. Collaboration between the two can further accelerate the region’s pursuit of competitiveness in digital markets. With the offer of lower latency, improved security, and sustainable computing, Amazon’s move can accelerate cloud adoption across industries. As businesses in Mexico and Latin America embrace cloud technologies, they will be better positioned to compete globally, innovate faster, and reduce operational costs. For companies considering cloud migration, now is the time to take advantage of AWS’s growing presence in Latin America—leveraging world-class cloud services, closer to home. Other experts agree with Victoria and Cortés-Rello on their enthusiasm for the project, noting that it solidifies Querétaro’s position as a host city for “regions” established by all major cloud service providers (Oracle, Google, Microsoft, and AWS). However, they also emphasize the potential for further investment to explore other areas of the web services supply chain. In Cortés-Rello’s words: “investment should now go to creation and not only to cloud services provision. To complement this technological leap, we need investment in startups and advanced R&D in Mexico. We can’t just be consumers. We [as an increasingly leading country in the tech sector] need to turn into creators.” Colombian business, politics, and cultural journalist. Managing Editor for Nearshore Americas and El Enemigo.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/h1b-visa-restirctions-could-boost-nearshoring/,H1-B Visa Restrictions Likely to Boost Nearshore - Nearshore Americas,2025-04-03T16:00:23+00:00,"Tech giants, including Microsoft, Google and Amazon, warned H1-B Visa employees this week against leaving the country for fear of not being allowed back in, the latest twist in an ongoing conversation surrounding immigration in America. As anxiety rises among U.S. visa holders amid rising deportations and scrutiny, some Nearshore industry experts are saying the","Tech giants, including Microsoft, Google and Amazon, warned H1-B Visa employees this week against leaving the country for fear of not being allowed back in, the latest twist in an ongoing conversation surrounding immigration in America. As anxiety rises among U.S. visa holders amid rising deportations and scrutiny, some Nearshore industry experts are saying the dynamic could be beneficial to companies aligned with talent acquisition in Latin America. The H1-B Visa program brings more than 100,000 highly educated foreigners to the U.S. each year for jobs that pay at least $60,000 per year. Typically, about 500,000 to 600,000 H1-B Visa holders are on American soil at any one time, about 70% of which are Indian nationals. This week, Indian H1-B workers voiced concerns to The Washington Post about the changes in immigration policy, with one noting the recent revocation of birthright citizenship, meaning the U.S.-born children of visa holders are at risk of becoming stateless upon birth. The Trump administration has not been consistent with its messaging on H1-B Visas, which was most recently highlighted during a public disagreement between a cohort of Trump supporters and Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy in December. Musk and Ramaswamy advocated against restricting H1-B Visas as had been done during Trump’s first term . Trump ultimately decided to keep his hands off the H1-B program while signing a slew of executive orders in January that, in part, ordered “enhanced vetting” for visa applicants and those already in the country. With deportations skyrocketing and continued anti-immigration rhetoric emitting from the White House, experts are warning about the potential business implications that could arise from the increased scrutiny placed on immigration. Call to Elevate Service Amid the ever-changing rhetoric and heightened anxiety among visa holders, the situation may provide an opportunity for companies aligned with the nearshoring industry. “It’s an interesting moment for our market,” said Pablo Baldomá Jones, co-founder and chief executive officer of Alto , a global software engineering firm. “I would describe it as a cocktail of increasing talent predisposition toward remote work combined with this reduction in these visas.” Jones’ business focuses on connecting talent from Latin America to the U.S. He said if visa intake is reduced, salaries in America will likely rise, which will cause more opportunity and competition in the nearshore market. “It’s worth noting that nearshore companies present an alternative to H1-B talent, though this pushes providers to elevate their service standards to remain competitive. We’ve particularly noticed that some companies become more hesitant to work with nearshore providers when compliance requirements are stricter, such as in banking. And this drives all LatAm providers to raise the bar regarding security standards.” Heading for Brighter Pastures Pablo Miller, chief executive officer of Remoti , a platform specializing in remote talent solutions in Latin America, echoed Jones’ comments on immigration restrictions bringing opportunity to the nearshore industry, and also said it could cause a new influx of talent relocating to Latin American countries. A dual citizen of Britain and Colombia, Miller said there is a growing trend of Indian tech workers, who traditionally head for Silicon Valley, relocating to Colombia due to new restrictions and concerns. “When I lived in Colombia years ago, I didn’t see many Indians around, but now when you go there, just walking around the shopping center, it’s noticeable that these tech workers are relocating. There’s a growing number of Indian expats.” Miller is looking to the upcoming 2026 presidential election in Colombia as a key decider in how the country manages to take advantage of its business opportunities in the future. Incumbent Gustavo Petro is term-limited, and Miller said whichever candidate shows the most interest in bringing foreign dollars into the country is likely to win the election. “Who doesn’t want foreign dollars coming into Colombia? Who doesn’t want more jobs in Colombia? But, most importantly, who doesn’t want Silicon Valley knowledge coming into Colombia?” he said. “These companies may not necessarily be building in Colombia, but they’re going to be made in Colombia.” Riding the Wave of Momentum Jens Gould, Founder and CEO of Amalga Group , said he has seen some anecdotal evidence of overseas talent moving to Latin America, but hasn’t witnessed first-hand any major shift in the nationality of workers in the nearshoring industry. Nevertheless, if more quantifiable immigration restrictions were to occur, he also believes it could boost both the nearshore industry and Latin American countries overall. “In terms of any (potential) immigration policy in the U.S., if they restrict in any way, I actually think that could lead to more interest in services for nearshore companies. … If it’s harder to bring the world’s best talent to the U.S., the companies are still going to need that talent. They’re going to look elsewhere for it, and given the nearshore value proposition that we all know of — the time zone, the cultural affinity, the proximity — it’s the most logical place.” Gould said recent market factors have given a boost to nearshoring, including a drop in near-term interest rates that has spurred investment in the region. The Mexican government, which has focused heavily on supporting the manufacturing industry, and other regional governments could do more to support the potential for a nearshoring boom, he feels. “You see some activity, some investment, in education, particularly tech and engineering, some movement on tax incentives, development of tech hubs, but it’s not nearly enough. Mexico could do a lot more to incentivize this … there’s been a real increase in interest in Mexico’s tech talent, and you haven’t seen the government jump in and do that much.” Comment Name *  Email *  Website   Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.    Tim—spot on analysis. What’s happening around H1-B policy isn’t a side issue—it’s accelerating a deeper reconfiguration of how U.S. companies access global talent. And yes, Latin America is the next frontier—but we must be honest about the readiness gap. Most current SaaS platforms, even the newer EOR apps, don’t go far enough. They weren’t built to operate as full-stack, self-learning systems. The market now demands automation that connects sourcing, vetting, onboarding, compliance, and ongoing performance in one integrated loop. Anything less is just duct tape. The stakes are rising fast—literally. Salaries for engineers in LATAM are climbing, and vendors running outdated delivery models are struggling to hold onto clients. Why? Their rates are ballooning, but their value delivery hasn’t evolved. What we need now is an industry reset. Vendors need to run lean, with high-efficiency operations, less internal bloat, and transparent flat rates that give accounts room to grow without blowing up the client’s long-term budget. We laid this out in our research years ago, which unexpectedly became the first formal science papers focused on Nearshore IT Staff Augmentation. The takeaway is even more urgent now: the future belongs to platforms that can deliver velocity, accuracy, and transparency by design—not as a patch. —Lonnie McRorey When Debra Fraser first came to Jamaica from Canada in 2000 on a church mission trip, she never imagined she’d play a growing role in the Caribbean’s fast-growing business process outsourcing industry.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/rumors-vs-reality-the-real-cause-of-guyanas-bpo-woes/,Rumors vs. Reality: The Real Cause of Guyana’s BPO Woes - Nearshore Americas,2025-04-22T14:25:29+00:00,The closure of a facility operated by French BPO giant Teleperformance in Guyana has ignited a wave of speculation.,"The closure of a facility operated by French BPO giant Teleperformance (TP) in Guyana has ignited a wave of speculation. Whispers have grown so loud that some media outlets are now claiming the entire BPO sector in the Caribbean nation is teetering on the edge of collapse . The shuttered center, located at the busy intersection of Robb and Camp streets in Georgetown, didn’t go dark overnight. Some reports suggest that chronic absenteeism among employees was the main trigger. Others point to the possible loss of critical client contracts as another contributing factor. Guyana’s Vice President Dr. Bharrat Jagdeo, speaking to Guyana Times , blamed the closure on what he described as serious issues with punctuality and work ethic. “A lot of people apparently are finding jobs elsewhere, so a lot are leaving or some are showing up late,” he said. “They (Teleperformance) operate in a very competitive sector and they have clients abroad and if nobody is there, you can’t keep the quality of the service up,” he added. Yet, the narrative that Teleperformance is scaling down its presence in Guyana was firmly challenged by Peter Ramsaroop, chief investment officer at GO-INVEST, the country’s investment promotion agency. He insisted the company isn’t pulling out, but upgrading. “It’s worth noting that they recently rented a brand new building in Georgetown , around 60,000 square feet, plus another 30,000 square feet. That came with a 10-year lease. So, I’m not sure where the message that they’re ‘downsizing’ is coming from,” he wondered. Nearshore Americas contacted TP’s public relations officer, but she did not reply within a week of being contacted. Oil Companies Poaching BPO Staff? Just weeks ago, a group of BPO executives met with Finance Minister Dr. Ashni Singh, seeking the government’s help with staffing and retention challenges. Soon, several news outlets began pointing fingers at the oil sector. Flush with revenue, the argument went, oil companies are luring away skilled workers from BPOs. And it’s easy to see why this theory has gained traction — Guyana’s oil boom is reshaping its economic landscape. Between 2022 and 2024, the economy surged, averaging a staggering 47% annual GDP growth. Oil exports and heavy infrastructure investments were the engines behind that momentum. Looking ahead, the International Monetary Fund forecasts another strong year in 2025. Overall GDP is expected to rise by 10%, with the non-oil sector projected to grow by 13%. It’s a sign that Guyana’s growth is beginning to spread across other industries. However, the claim that oil firms are poaching BPO staff doesn’t quite hold up under scrutiny. “If you’re working in a call center, you wouldn’t necessarily be looking to join an oil company, so that’s not really true,” Ramsaroop said. Still, rumors often travel faster than facts. The recent exit of Jamaican BPO company Itel from Guyana has only amplified the noise, giving critics more reason to question the sector’s health. Ramsaroop did admit that Guyana is grappling with a shortage of skilled talent . But he quickly added that such shortages are a hallmark of every fast-growing economies around the globe. When asked what the government is doing to improve the human capital, he said: “We’re offering a lot of technical training. We’ve recently set up several major technical institutes across the country. Over the last four and a half years, we’ve awarded more than 40,000 scholarships to young people pursuing bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD degrees.” “In addition, we’ve been working closely with the BPO industry. If they require pre-employment training—for example, for high school graduates entering the workforce — the government supports those efforts.” Georgetown’s Retention Challenge It is, however, true that retention is one of the biggest hurdles for BPOs in Georgetown. But that’s not the case across the board — call centers outside the city are reportedly thriving. With more people relocating to outlying areas, the daily commute into Georgetown has become challenging. Ramsaroop explained that for many workers, long commutes involving multiple bus rides aren’t sustainable. The choice becomes obvious when a job opportunity pops up closer to home. He emphasized that companies must rethink how they support their workforce in this new environment. “The BPOs need to come up with strategies to retain their employees, offering transportation for some far-flung workers,” he added. “Remember, the issue is mainly in Georgetown. All the other call centers outside of Georgetown are doing extremely well.” News Editor for Nearshore Americas, Narayan Ammachchi is a career journalist with a decade of experience in politics and international business.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/costa-ricas-living-costs-rising-despite-low-inflation/,Costa Rica’s Living Costs Rising Despite Low Inflation - Nearshore Americas,2025-04-16T19:41:03+00:00,"Living costs in Costa Rica are rising even as the inflation rate plunges and the local currency, the colón, continues to strengthen.","Living costs in Costa Rica are rising even as inflation plunges and the local currency, the colón, continues to strengthen — an unusual combination that has puzzled economists. The inflation rate fell to a new low of 1.21% in March, down slightly from 1.24% in February. At the same time, a new report from the central bank has reignited debate over whether Costa Rica is, in fact, an expensive country. Authored by economic researcher Melissa Vega, the report compares Costa Rica with Chile in terms of overall living costs. Vega concludes that while Costa Rica may be comparable to Chile, it is considerably more expensive than upper-middle-income countries like Colombia and Mexico. The report indicates that health and education are categories where Costa Rica has remained more expensive than similar countries in Latin America. Though the overall price levels appear to place Costa Rica on par with Chile, a more granular breakdown by product category reveals troubling disparities. The cost differences are especially pronounced in staple food items. Milk, cheese, and eggs in Costa Rica cost between 24% and 26% more than the OECD average and up to 28% more than the Latin American average. Prices for soft drinks and bottled water are 19% to 22% higher than in OECD countries and 29% higher than in Latin America. Even basic items like bread and cereals are 5% to 7% more expensive than in OECD countries and up to 25% more than in Latin America. The price gap widens further in categories such as fruits, vegetables, and potatoes, which are up to 9% costlier than in the OECD and as much as 41% more expensive than in the rest of Latin America. Businessmen are Worried Adolfo Cruz, President of CAMTIC , expressed disappointment at the rising prices. “We’ve lost competitiveness and have become a very expensive country.” The Costa Rican Chamber of Information and Communication Technologies (CAMTIC) is a key organization that represents and promotes the interests of the ICT sector in the country. The surging colón is apparently dealing a double-whammy impact on global services providers operating in the country. Since late 2022, the colón has risen around 30% , climbing from a low of 670 per U.S. dollar to around 500 today. Cruz is also skeptical of the inflation figures published monthly by the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC). He contends that the explanations offered by the agency fail to reflect the lived reality. “Costa Rica risks becoming a destination that only the affluent can afford,” warned Casey Halloran, CEO of Costa Rican Vacations , a travel agency based in the country’s capital, San José. “This isn’t just about currency; structural issues like high food prices, transport costs, and bureaucratic burdens drive prices up.” Employment Costs Halloran is also concerned about the ripple effects of high living costs on payroll expenses. Costa Rica adjusts its minimum wage almost annually, and while the country offers generous incentives to firms operating in its free trade zones, the cost of employment is steep. Employers must contribute approximately 26% of an employee’s salary to social security (including insurance and pensions) — more than double the OECD average of 12% . This translates into significantly higher labor costs for companies operating in Costa Rica. In addition, employers are required to pay a mandatory Christmas bonus, known locally as Aguinaldo — equivalent to one-twelfth of the employee’s total earnings over the previous 12 months — as well as paid vacation leave for those who have worked at least 50 consecutive weeks. Carlos Wong, president of the Free Trade Zones Association (AZOFRAS), highlighted these pressures in comments to local media outlet El Observador . He noted that the strengthening of the colón against the U.S. dollar has sharply increased operating costs. This, he warned, is restricting business expansion and delaying job-creating projects. Wong also referred to the OECD findings, emphasizing that a combination of high energy costs and burdensome operational expenses is weighing on business expansion.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/caribbean-tourism-surpasses-pre-pandemic-levels/,Caribbean Tourism Surpasses Pre-Pandemic Levels - Nearshore Americas,2025-05-02T13:01:55+00:00,"The Caribbean's tourism industry roared back in 2024, welcoming an estimated 34.2 million foreign visitors.","The Caribbean’s tourism industry roared back in 2024, welcoming an estimated 34.2 million foreign visitors — a 6.9% increase over pre-pandemic levels and a clear sign of a full recovery. This resurgence delivered a powerful boost to local economies and employment, cementing tourism’s role as a vital economic engine for the region. According to the Caribbean Tourism Organisation (CTO), the majority of visitors came from traditional source markets — the United States, Canada, and Europe. Leading the pack were American travelers, with 16.8 million arrivals, up 3.5% from 2023 and nearly 8% higher than in 2019. Americans alone made up almost half of all international tourists to the Caribbean. Canada followed with 3.3 million visitors, a 4% rise from the previous year, though still slightly below its 2019 benchmark. Meanwhile, European tourism showed more modest momentum. Visitor numbers inched up 1.4%, totaling 5.3 million. Analysts attribute the sluggish pace to volatile exchange rates , rising airfare costs and persistent economic headwinds in parts of Europe. Cruise tourism also made waves in 2024. Roughly 33.7 million passengers visited the region via cruise ships — a 10.3% jump from the prior year — driven by the return of major cruise operators and pent-up global demand. Famed for its island charm, vibrant culture and wide-ranging attractions, the Caribbean remains a premier destination worldwide. However, experts caution that 2025 may bring slower growth, as economic uncertainty and geopolitical friction weigh on international travel demand.

The expansion comes after the company announced plans to hire more than 200 programmers over the next two years. The company said in a statement that the Santa Cruz location is designed to attract local bilingual talent and integrate multidisciplinary teams that will work on international projects under the nearshoring model. “Santa Cruz has a dynamic business ecosystem and enormous technological potential. With this new office, we seek to strengthen our presence in the region and continue recruiting highly qualified talent,” said Daniel Gumucio, chief executive officer of AssureSoft. The Bolivian team will work for the company’s clients in the United States, Canada and Europe. In the meantime, AssureSoft has launched training programs for newly graduated engineers, providing them with technical training, English language skills and cultural skills to integrate into international teams. “We have historically established partnerships with the best universities in Bolivia, and we also have internship programs that we will continue to promote in engineering schools,” Gumucio said. The approach seeks to level the playing field of Bolivian professionals and prepare them for the challenges presented by ever-changing global technology. AssureSoft was founded in 2006 by Daniel Gumucio in Cochabamba, Bolivia, with a vision of exporting talent and software services. Over the past five years, it has maintained annual growth of 35%. Since its inception, the company has focused on custom software development and engineering team building. It currently has engineering teams in several Bolivian cities (Cochabamba, La Paz, Santa Cruz, Potosí, Oruro, and Tarija), as well as offices in Paraguay and the United States.

At the China-CELAC Forum in Beijing, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , Colombian President Gustavo Petro, and Chilean President Gabriel Boric are set to engage in discussions to enhance regional cooperation. President Lula’s visit aims to expand Brazil’s exports of soybeans, meats, and minerals to China, capitalizing on opportunities arising from U.S.-China trade tensions . This visit marks his third meeting with President Xi Jinping since 2023, reflecting deepening bilateral ties. Meanwhile, Colombia’s President Petro announced the country’s accession to China’s Belt and Road Initiative, focusing on infrastructure development and technological advancement. This move underscores Colombia’s pursuit of diversified partnerships beyond traditional U.S. alliances. China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi emphasized Latin America’s right to self-determination, subtly critiquing U.S. policies reminiscent of the Monroe Doctrine. He highlighted China’s commitment to mutual respect and non-interference in the region’s affairs. Economic ties between Brazil and China have intensified, with bilateral trade reaching $157.62 billion in the first ten months of 2024. China remains Brazil’s largest trading partner , importing significant volumes of soybeans, iron ore, and oil. This strategic realignment indicates a broader trend of Latin American nations seeking diversified economic partnerships, balancing relations between major global powers.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/chile-and-puerto-rico-latams-top-digitally-competitive-economies/,Chile and Puerto Rico: LatAm’s Top Digitally Competitive Economies - Nearshore Americas,2024-12-17T18:12:30+00:00,"Poor educational system and reluctance to embrace new technology weakening digital competency in LatAm, but Chile and Puerto Rico shine as beacons of hope.","The poor educational system and reluctance to embrace new technology solutions are weakening the digital competency of many Latin American countries. Yet, Chile and Puerto Rico shine as beacons of hope, according to the Digital Competitiveness Ranking , prepared by Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development (IMD). Strong ICT infrastructure and pro-business policies are driving digital transformation in Chile and Puerto Rico. However, when it comes to technology integration, every country in the region lags. The report emphasizes that adopting new technologies is no longer optional but essential for economic growth. Delays in tech adoption could widen the digital divide, hampering progress and limiting economic potential. The IMD highlights technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and quantum computing as key drivers of economic growth. AI, for instance, can enhance productivity , blockchain can improve governance transparency and reduce corruption, while quantum computing can bolster research and innovation. The IMD analyzed seven countries: Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Peru, and Venezuela. The report’s analysts have urged Mexico to alleviate business community concerns by reducing policy uncertainty and strengthening democratic institutions. Argentina, the analysts insist, should liberalize forex regulations and mitigate the impact of economic turmoil on businesses to support its digital companies. Brazil, the region’s largest economy, lags in many segments of the digital economy, primarily due to a lack of quality education, which perpetuates a talent shortage. Colombia, according to the report, is preparing well for the future but is slow to adopt cutting-edge technologies like AI and quantum computing. Sporadic power outages in recent months are deterring investors, the report warns, suggesting that Colombia should rebuild its power infrastructure. Chile: the Rising Star Chile slipped from 39th to 42nd in the latest ranking compared to 2021. Despite this decline, the country’s strong ICT infrastructure and expansive data center networks position it well to harness advanced technologies. Valparaíso , a key port city, leads the way with average internet speeds of 321.85 Mbps, outperforming many U.S. cities and ranking as the world’s fastest for network access, according to the Global Speedtest Index . Pablo Rossel Estay, head of BPO firm CGS’s operations in Chile , credits the country’s ICT advancements to its telecom sector liberalization in the 1980s. “Large-scale projects like the Humboldt Cable—a 14,000 km undersea link connecting Chile to Australia—have further reinforced Chile’s role as a regional data center hub,” he explained. While the report highlights significant efficiency gains among Chilean businesses and improved access to finance, Claudia Perez, IT and Technology Recruitment Specialist at Robert Walters in Chile, sees challenges, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). “Many smaller businesses still struggle due to limited resources for digital transformation,” she noted. A digital transformation law enacted in 2019 mandates technological adoption, but implementation has been sluggish. Cybersecurity, however, has seen notable progress, with stricter regulations enacted to safeguard personal information. “Chile’s laws progress slowly, creating a complex regulatory environment. Some initiatives, like electronic signatures and data governance policies, have helped regulate aspects of the digital economy. Still, there’s much more to be done,” she added. One of Chile’s most pressing issues remains the shortage of qualified tech talent. “While Chile has a sizable pool of tech professionals, the situation is complicated. Many lack certifications or the necessary skills for emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI),” Perez added. The problem is exacerbated as foreign companies attract top talent with competitive salaries and fully remote work opportunities.  Perez warns that a lack of advanced training and low technical skills could stifle Chile’s digital growth. Promising Puerto Rico Like Chile, Puerto Rico benefits from a strong ICT infrastructure. Despite the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017, the US territory rebounded quickly. “Puerto Rico has a limited data center, peering, and cloud infrastructure. However, it does host landing stations for over a dozen submarine cables,” says Jon Hjembo , Senior Research Manager at TeleGeography . Hjembo believes Puerto Rico could see more submarine cables running through its territory in the years to come. “San Juan serves as a key node for cables spanning Latin America, the Caribbean, and the continental U.S.,” he adds. However, Puerto Rico faces a worsening talent shortage, a challenge similar to other Latin American nations. According to Boston Consulting Group, only 2.8% of the island’s workforce is employed in the digital sector, compared to up to 10% in comparable markets. Higher education institutions are another weak point, producing only about 100 graduates annually in high-tech fields. Many of these graduates leave the island for better opportunities and higher salaries, particularly on the US mainland.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/declining-us-dollar-could-trigger-far-reaching-disruption/,Declining US Dollar Could Trigger Far-Reaching Disruption - Nearshore Americas,2025-03-25T13:53:34+00:00,"The declining US dollar looks set to pose new challenges to service exporters across Latin America. From tourism to BPOs, all are feeling the pinch.","As the US dollar weakens, Nearshore service providers are feeling the squeeze. With regional currencies rising against the greenback, many of them face the prospect of lower income or significant losses on contracts they signed with their American clients. “Yes, we have also been getting more pushback on pricing lately,” acknowledged Jeremy Stryer, co-founder of Holadev, a Queretaro, Mexico-based software development firm, most of whose clients are startups in the United States. “The constant exchange rate swings make it tough to predict pricing and revenue,” Stryer added. Mexico stands on shaky financial ground, more than any other country in the region. With exports accounting for 40% of its GDP—80% bound for the U.S. — a weakening dollar threatens to derail its dream of becoming the “China next door” for global manufacturing. After rising to new highs immediately after the election of President Donald Trump, the U.S. Dollar Index began to slide earlier this month. Already, the greenback has dropped nearly 5% from its 2025 highs. Analysts expect it to decline further in the coming months. Surprisingly, Latin American currencies had begun to strengthen even before the Dollar Index started sputtering. Argentina’s peso has surged by 40% in recent months, transforming the South American country from the cheapest destination in dollar terms to the most expensive in the region. Today, for many Argentines, living abroad now costs less than staying at home. The Mexican peso has appreciated nearly 5% against the greenback this year. Remarkably, the peso is rising even as the US imposes 25% tariffs on imports. The Brazilian real, meanwhile, has inched up by just 1.5% against the US dollar, largely influenced by high interest rates. One of the world’s top-performing currencies this year is the Colombian peso , which has surged 7.36%. The Peruvian sol has also made gains, appreciating 2.12% against the dollar, securing its place as the sixth-best-performing currency in the region. “It has been pretty crazy with respect to local currency fluctuations versus the U.S. dollar,” says Casey Halloran , CEO & Co-Founder of Costa Rican Vacations . “We are all grappling with this new reality and attempting to plan for continued shockwaves,” Halloran added. The declining US dollar “has indeed sparked concern among businesses relying on nearshoring models,” said Christian Corcino , founder and chairman at Intellisys D Corp , a nearshore IT services provider based in the Dominican Republic. But Corcino’s firm has yet to feel its ill effects. That’s largely because, as Corcino explains, the Dominican Republic’s peso has historically been closely tied to the dollar. “As the dollar’s value decreases, the Dominican peso tends to mirror that movement, so the impact on operational costs and competitiveness remains relatively neutral. Consequently, our own business, which employs personnel exclusively in the Dominican Republic, has seen minimal effect from the dollar’s recent decline.” Weak Dollar and Wage Growth Corcino noted that rising minimum wages, coupled with the decline in the USD, might prompt companies to adjust pricing or optimize resources to maintain profitability. He added that an increase in overall operational expenses for IT and BPO providers is a natural consequence of these economic shifts. In January, Costa Rica raised wages by 2.37%. Mexico implemented a 12% increase in its general minimum wage this year, while Brazil hiked it by 3.23%. Colombia’s minimum wage has nearly doubled in less than a decade. In February, Argentina enacted a 20% wage hike to help workers cope with soaring inflation. The Dominican Republic followed suit, making history with its own 20% wage increase. However, the increase in minimum wages is less likely to have a significant impact on IT workers. “For our organization, however, this shift has been less significant. Our employees — primarily software developers — already earn salaries well above the minimum wage, meaning the direct impact on payroll expenses is limited,” Corcino added. “Going forward, service providers across the region can navigate higher labor costs by focusing on specialized skill sets, improving efficiency, and delivering higher-value services, ensuring that any wage increases are balanced by productivity gains and a stronger competitive edge.” Impact on Tourism The impact of the weakened dollar could become evident in the quarterly fiscal reports of nearshore vendors later in April. However, its effects are already apparent in the tourism sector. Costa Rica’s tourism industry has suffered five consecutive months of declining foreign visitors, as the local currency, the colon, surged to historic highs. Before the pandemic, a three-day package cost around US$180 per person . Now, the same package exceeds $400—more than double the previous price. “The Colon vs. USD exchange rate has been detrimental to tourism since late 2022, when the USD to Colon rate fell from a peak of 670 to 500 (-25%),” Halloran added. By March 15, the colon had reached an all-time high of 485 per USD, as the international airports across the country showed a deep dip in foreign arrivals. “It has remained at that 500 level today, and multiple industries — agriculture, nearshoring, tourism, real estate, medical tourism, shipping — are highly concerned that a further decline in the USD’s value could lead to a loss of competitiveness,” Halloran said. Argentina Becomes Ever More Expensive President Javier Milei devalued Argentina’s currency by 54% shortly after taking office. A year later, it rebounded as the so-called “superpeso.” Meanwhile, the minimum wage jumped from 156,000 pesos at the start of 2024 to 272,000 pesos today — a 76% increase in nominal terms. In dollar value, it rose from $157 to $228. According to a report from online job platform Bumeran , the average salary sought in Argentina now stands at $1,234, surpassing the regional average. Just a year ago, it ranked among the lowest in Latin America. The stronger peso has reshaped tourism patterns. Fewer foreign tourists are visiting Argentina, while more Argentines are opting for trips abroad. In 2024, foreign tourist arrivals dropped by 8.4% to 6.2 million visitors, while the number of Argentine travelers heading overseas surged by 11.8%, reaching 8.3 million, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INDEC).

https://nearshoreamericas.com/caribbean-education-a-colonial-era-system-is-not-cutting-it/,Caribbean Education: A Colonial-Era System is Not Cutting It - Nearshore Americas,2025-03-27T17:48:46+00:00,"The Caribbean’s education system is in crisis, with recent studies showing most students struggle with mathematics, a fundamental skill in the modern world.","The Caribbean’s education system is in crisis, with recent studies showing a large majority of students struggling with mathematics, a fundamental skill in the modern world. “We are confronting a crisis … in education,” warned Lilia Burunciuc, the World Bank’s country director for the Caribbean, during a recent webinar. Unless urgent action is taken, Burunciuc said, the region’s economic future could be at risk. In the 2024 Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate exams, only 4.9% of students passed five or more subjects, including Mathematics and English . Even more concerning, just 36% passed Mathematics. But intelligence is not the problem. Caribbean students are just as capable as their global counterparts. The real issues, according to Victoria Levin, a senior economist in the World Bank’s education global practice, are outdated teaching methods and deep-rooted inequalities in educational access. Colonial Legacy Still Shapes Education The education system, shaped by colonial-era practices, still favors the privileged. Under colonial rule, elite schools were reserved for wealthy students. Today, private schools continue the tradition through selective entrance exams, a “sorting mechanism” as Levin describes it. In Trinidad and Tobago, for example, the Secondary Entrance Assessment (SEA) is a high-stakes exam for 11- to 13-year-olds seeking entry into public secondary schools. It is essentially a modern version of the British-era College Exhibition Examination, originally designed to limit access to education. SEA heavily tests students in Mathematics and Creative Writing, and only top scorers secure places in the best schools. And this isn’t unique to Trinidad — Barbados, Jamaica, and other Caribbean nations follow similar models. Even after rigorous selection, less than 80% of students pass English, and fewer than half succeed in Mathematics, Levin added. Higher Education Thrives, Yet Early Education Suffers Surprisingly, the Caribbean spends more on college education than on primary schooling. “Higher education, especially through the University of the West Indies system, has made considerable improvements over the past decade,” said Scott MacDonald, a fellow at the Caribbean Policy Consortium , in a conversation with Nearshore Americas. From his experience, graduates from these institutions are competent and well-prepared. However, many struggle due to weak foundational education. For the region to advance, MacDonald insists, reform is essential. “Competition is global,” he warns. Without fixing the education system, the Caribbean risks falling further behind. MacDonald, an expert in Caribbean economic issues, has taught political science in several institutions and authored books on the region’s development challenges. Teachers Are Leaving in Large Numbers For decades, the Caribbean has been losing teachers to better-paying countries . Jamaica alone lost 10% of its teacher workforce in just three years. In 2022, 1,538 teachers left in just nine months. Some aren’t just leaving the country — they’re leaving the profession altogether. “Some (teachers) are not migrating but leaving the profession (altogether) because they are overworked, underpaid, and undervalued,” said Dr. Garth Anderson, head of the Caribbean Teachers’ Union, at a 2023 conference in Barbados . Even newly qualified teachers in the UK, Canada, and the U.S. earn two to three times more than those in Jamaica, St. Lucia, Suriname and Trinidad, according to a University of the West Indies study. Beyond low wages, many Caribbean nations lack clear teacher recruitment and training standards. A World Bank and OECS study found that in many countries, teachers don’t receive full training until nearly a decade into their careers. The entry requirements are shockingly low. In Grenada, for example, a person can become a teacher with just five subject passes. Until 2019, new teachers received only a two-week induction program—their only formal preparation before taking charge of a classroom. Guyana’s Smart Classrooms: A Model for Change While most of the Caribbean struggles with outdated education systems, one country is taking a bold step forward. Guyana, fueled by its booming oil wealth, is embracing the future. In 2021, with support from the World Bank, Guyana introduced smart classrooms — equipping schools with smartboards, projectors, and laptops. The impact has been remarkable. At Kuru Kururu Primary School, 38 kilometers south of Georgetown, attendance has improved dramatically. “The difference is clear — students are more engaged than ever,” the head teacher told the World Bank. Teachers, too, are benefiting. With digital tools, they can refine their teaching methods and continuously improve. Before, lessons relied on static charts and worksheets. Thanks to the interactive way of learning, studying maths has become a joyful experience for students. Encouraged by this success, Guyana announced a $676 million investment in late 2024 to expand smart classrooms nationwide.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/h1b-visa-restirctions-could-boost-nearshoring/,H1-B Visa Restrictions Likely to Boost Nearshore - Nearshore Americas,2025-04-03T16:00:23+00:00,"Tech giants, including Microsoft, Google and Amazon, warned H1-B Visa employees this week against leaving the country for fear of not being allowed back in, the latest twist in an ongoing conversation surrounding immigration in America. As anxiety rises among U.S. visa holders amid rising deportations and scrutiny, some Nearshore industry experts are saying the","Tech giants, including Microsoft, Google and Amazon, warned H1-B Visa employees this week against leaving the country for fear of not being allowed back in, the latest twist in an ongoing conversation surrounding immigration in America. As anxiety rises among U.S. visa holders amid rising deportations and scrutiny, some Nearshore industry experts are saying the dynamic could be beneficial to companies aligned with talent acquisition in Latin America. The H1-B Visa program brings more than 100,000 highly educated foreigners to the U.S. each year for jobs that pay at least $60,000 per year. Typically, about 500,000 to 600,000 H1-B Visa holders are on American soil at any one time, about 70% of which are Indian nationals. This week, Indian H1-B workers voiced concerns to The Washington Post about the changes in immigration policy, with one noting the recent revocation of birthright citizenship, meaning the U.S.-born children of visa holders are at risk of becoming stateless upon birth. The Trump administration has not been consistent with its messaging on H1-B Visas, which was most recently highlighted during a public disagreement between a cohort of Trump supporters and Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy in December. Musk and Ramaswamy advocated against restricting H1-B Visas as had been done during Trump’s first term . Trump ultimately decided to keep his hands off the H1-B program while signing a slew of executive orders in January that, in part, ordered “enhanced vetting” for visa applicants and those already in the country. With deportations skyrocketing and continued anti-immigration rhetoric emitting from the White House, experts are warning about the potential business implications that could arise from the increased scrutiny placed on immigration. Call to Elevate Service Amid the ever-changing rhetoric and heightened anxiety among visa holders, the situation may provide an opportunity for companies aligned with the nearshoring industry. “It’s an interesting moment for our market,” said Pablo Baldomá Jones, co-founder and chief executive officer of Alto , a global software engineering firm. “I would describe it as a cocktail of increasing talent predisposition toward remote work combined with this reduction in these visas.” Jones’ business focuses on connecting talent from Latin America to the U.S. He said if visa intake is reduced, salaries in America will likely rise, which will cause more opportunity and competition in the nearshore market. “It’s worth noting that nearshore companies present an alternative to H1-B talent, though this pushes providers to elevate their service standards to remain competitive. We’ve particularly noticed that some companies become more hesitant to work with nearshore providers when compliance requirements are stricter, such as in banking. And this drives all LatAm providers to raise the bar regarding security standards.” Heading for Brighter Pastures Pablo Miller, chief executive officer of Remoti , a platform specializing in remote talent solutions in Latin America, echoed Jones’ comments on immigration restrictions bringing opportunity to the nearshore industry, and also said it could cause a new influx of talent relocating to Latin American countries. A dual citizen of Britain and Colombia, Miller said there is a growing trend of Indian tech workers, who traditionally head for Silicon Valley, relocating to Colombia due to new restrictions and concerns. “When I lived in Colombia years ago, I didn’t see many Indians around, but now when you go there, just walking around the shopping center, it’s noticeable that these tech workers are relocating. There’s a growing number of Indian expats.” Miller is looking to the upcoming 2026 presidential election in Colombia as a key decider in how the country manages to take advantage of its business opportunities in the future. Incumbent Gustavo Petro is term-limited, and Miller said whichever candidate shows the most interest in bringing foreign dollars into the country is likely to win the election. “Who doesn’t want foreign dollars coming into Colombia? Who doesn’t want more jobs in Colombia? But, most importantly, who doesn’t want Silicon Valley knowledge coming into Colombia?” he said. “These companies may not necessarily be building in Colombia, but they’re going to be made in Colombia.” Riding the Wave of Momentum Jens Gould, Founder and CEO of Amalga Group , said he has seen some anecdotal evidence of overseas talent moving to Latin America, but hasn’t witnessed first-hand any major shift in the nationality of workers in the nearshoring industry. Nevertheless, if more quantifiable immigration restrictions were to occur, he also believes it could boost both the nearshore industry and Latin American countries overall. “In terms of any (potential) immigration policy in the U.S., if they restrict in any way, I actually think that could lead to more interest in services for nearshore companies. … If it’s harder to bring the world’s best talent to the U.S., the companies are still going to need that talent. They’re going to look elsewhere for it, and given the nearshore value proposition that we all know of — the time zone, the cultural affinity, the proximity — it’s the most logical place.” Gould said recent market factors have given a boost to nearshoring, including a drop in near-term interest rates that has spurred investment in the region. The Mexican government, which has focused heavily on supporting the manufacturing industry, and other regional governments could do more to support the potential for a nearshoring boom, he feels. “You see some activity, some investment, in education, particularly tech and engineering, some movement on tax incentives, development of tech hubs, but it’s not nearly enough. Mexico could do a lot more to incentivize this … there’s been a real increase in interest in Mexico’s tech talent, and you haven’t seen the government jump in and do that much.” Comment Name *  Email *  Website   Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.    Tim—spot on analysis. What’s happening around H1-B policy isn’t a side issue—it’s accelerating a deeper reconfiguration of how U.S. companies access global talent. And yes, Latin America is the next frontier—but we must be honest about the readiness gap. Most current SaaS platforms, even the newer EOR apps, don’t go far enough. They weren’t built to operate as full-stack, self-learning systems. The market now demands automation that connects sourcing, vetting, onboarding, compliance, and ongoing performance in one integrated loop. Anything less is just duct tape. The stakes are rising fast—literally. Salaries for engineers in LATAM are climbing, and vendors running outdated delivery models are struggling to hold onto clients. Why? Their rates are ballooning, but their value delivery hasn’t evolved. What we need now is an industry reset. Vendors need to run lean, with high-efficiency operations, less internal bloat, and transparent flat rates that give accounts room to grow without blowing up the client’s long-term budget. We laid this out in our research years ago, which unexpectedly became the first formal science papers focused on Nearshore IT Staff Augmentation. The takeaway is even more urgent now: the future belongs to platforms that can deliver velocity, accuracy, and transparency by design—not as a patch. —Lonnie McRorey When U.S. President Donald Trump captured the White House in 2016, his economic agenda was made crystal clear: Bring more jobs back to America.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/police-bpo-employee-stole-tickets-by-abusing-stubhub-access/,Police: BPO Employee Stole Tickets by Abusing StubHub Access - Nearshore Americas,2025-04-09T16:15:56+00:00,"Global BPO provider Sutherland Global Services (SGS) has been thrust into controversy after an employee at its Kingston, Jamaica,","Global BPO provider Sutherland Global Services (SGS) has been thrust into controversy after an employee at its Kingston, Jamaica, office was implicated in a ticket fraud scheme that inflicted substantial financial losses on its client, StubHub . One of the suspects, Tyrone Rose, along with an unidentified co-worker, exploited their privileged system access to manipulate a loophole in StubHub’s platform, according to a complaint filed with a criminal court in Queens, New York. The American ticket marketplace had a reseller contract with Sutherland, granting its employees access to specific backend functions. Rose and his accomplice capitalized on this access to resell nearly 1,000 tickets for high-profile events, including Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour , Adele and Ed Sheeran concerts, NBA games, and the U.S. Open Tennis Championships. StubHub generates a unique URL for each ticket purchase, allowing buyers to download their tickets. Rose and his co-worker infiltrated a restricted part of the system where ticket orders were stored. They then altered the email addresses linked to these orders, redirecting the ticket download links to their associates instead of the legitimate buyers. Between June 2022 and July 2023, they stole 993 tickets across 350 orders, with the majority coming from Swift’s Eras Tour, thanks to its record-breaking demand. When StubHub uncovered the fraud, it swiftly terminated its contract with Sutherland and alerted law enforcement. New York police have arrested Tyrone Rose and Shamara Simmons, while a third suspect remains on the run. A fourth accomplice died before facing charges. Rose and Simmons are now confronting serious charges, including grand larceny, computer tampering, and conspiracy, which could result in prison sentences ranging from 3 to 15 years. Could it be Avoided? The case has ignited major concerns about security oversight at Sutherland, leaving the global BPO firm scrambling to contain the fallout. Jared Koll, a CX advisor based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, believes Sutherland could have averted the incident had it implemented “AI-anomaly solutions.” These tools monitor agents’ behavior and flag high-risk actions, such as accessing unauthorized databases. “Further, geo-fencing and device security could have stopped these agents from accessing unauthorized systems in the first place, through permissions and device access controls.” After discovering the fraud, StubHub promptly issued a press release and announced the contract termination. However, Sutherland has remained silent, neither making a public statement nor responding to Nearshore Americas’ email inquiry. “We don’t know the internal steps SGS is taking, but if we were advising them, we’d expect a full post-mortem and an RFP process for upgraded security infrastructure,” Koll said when asked about potential next steps. “If you are a Jamaica-based BPO that is NOT SGS, you should launch a full messaging push, publicly highlighting the compliance improvements you’ve made since 2024.” Jamaica’s Reaction According to Radio Jamaica, Wayne Sinclair, president of the Global Services Association of Jamaica (GSAJ), said the incident has cast a long shadow over Jamaica’s BPO industry. This is partly because the accused are Jamaican nationals who likely exploited the trust Sutherland Global placed in them. Sinclair called for hefty penalties on employees who engage in such crimes. “Such (punishments) will act as a real deterrent to people who may be thinking about doing this because I think right now there’s a sense that it’s worth the risk.” However, the GSAJ President emphasized that all BPOs have enforced stringent security protocols to safeguard client data. He stressed that this breach occurred due to a betrayal of trust by employees. “Our BPOs have strong, independent relationships with clients, reinforced by frequent client visits to our locations and rigorous inspections of our physical and IT security protocols and processes.” “The confidence of our collective client base in our service is rooted in these trusted personal relationships.” News Editor for Nearshore Americas, Narayan Ammachchi is a career journalist with a decade of experience in politics and international business.

As the saturation of more established hubs in Mexico, Colombia and various Central American countries solidifies, Hermosillo’s providers plan to attract more businesses, according to government officials and industry leaders present during the “BPO Influencers and CX Leadership Summit” on March 14. The summit was organized by Alliance BPO Services , a Hermosillo-based BPO provider with global presence for multiple industries in North America, Latin America & Caribbean. Alliance BPO Services offers custom-tailored agreements, with performance commitments aligned to their client success, instead of standard service contracts. Local insights are crucial to understanding why Hermosillo is capturing interest and how it compares with established BPO hotspots in the region. Local Talent Pool and Workforce Dynamics Around a dozen international BPOs currently operate in Hermosillo, according to research from the firm Ryan Strategic Advisory . The city boasts a young, educated workforce, a significant advantage for BPO firms. Hermosillo has a population of around one million people. “The fresh talent coming out of our universities is not only tech-savvy but also adaptable. We see graduates translating their knowledge into real-world skills for service excellence,” said local entrepreneur and Alliance BPO Services CEO Juan Caire. Caire added that Hermosillo’s universities and technical schools are focusing on producing graduates well-versed in technology, administration, and languages, which is essential for catering to diverse client needs. This growing talent pool allows companies like Alliance BPO Services to meet specific customer demands effectively. “Our clients frequently note that our staff’s linguistic abilities and cultural familiarity with the US audience set us apart; it’s more than just outsourcing; it is about creating a seamless extension of their teams,” said Alliance BPO Services Co-founder Daniel Castilla. For Peter Ryan, President and Principal Analyst of Ryan Strategic Advisory, Alliance BPO Services is taking a pragmatic and practical approach to its development of AI tools. “By applying the technology in areas in which it can make a positive difference to the consumer, as opposed to pushing it into use cases where it may not be ready, Alliance BPO is likely to gain traction from its current and existing clients searching for a full service provider,” Ryan told Nearshore Americas. Adopting Technology and AI Hermosillo operators understand that they are pursuing market shares growth in highly competitive market macro conditions. Firms like Alliance BPO Services expect that an “all in” approach to technology will differentiate their unique value proposition. Alliance BPO Services is pioneering efforts to integrate artificial intelligence into their operations, not to substitute human agents, but to enhance their capabilities. “AI enables us to improve efficiency and quality of service. Clients are responding positively, reporting faster response times and improved satisfaction through AI-supported customer interactions. We are not trying to replace our employees but help them identify gaps and improve their performance,” Castilla said. Live translation technologies are becoming a staple. “With our ability to communicate in real time with customers across cultures, we can bridge language barriers that have historically impeded efficiency,” Caire said. This tech-savvy approach ensures that Hermosillo remains competitive, particularly in industries that require immediate and multilingual support. Strategic Location and Market Access Hermosillo’s geographical positioning near the U.S. border is another factor that enhances its appeal. Proximity allows companies to effectively manage cross-border operations with minimal cultural and time zone discrepancies. According to the CEO and Founder of SupportU Hui Curtis, “Hermosillo’s location enables firms to provide robust customer support services that resonate with US clients.” This geographical advantage is not just theoretical; local BPO firms report being able to align workflows with US business hours, reducing lag and enhancing service delivery. SupportU currently assists a client doing business out of Hermosillo. Ongoing investments in infrastructure, particularly in transportation and communication networks, will bolster this advantage. Challenges on the horizon The visibility of Hermosillo as a BPO destination outside of Mexico is limited. “We need to advocate more effectively for our capabilities and the talent we offer to attract international clients,” said Arturo Fernandez, President of Sonora Global. This raises the issue of effective marketing and branding for the city’s BPO services. “I see two main challenges — the first is gaining visibility, in a sea of nearshore options.  It will be important for the Hermosillo stakeholders in private and public domains to work together to make certain their community is part of the broader Mexican / nearshore discussion.  The second one is air connections — it will be essential for the business community to lobby for more flights into the city from the U.S. and other foreign ports.  Currently, for business travelers it can be cumbersome to visit,” Ryan added. Navigating regulatory challenges is another ongoing concern. Firms must ensure compliance with local, state, and federal regulations as they expand. Streamlined regulations could play a vital role in easing entry and operation for new BPO companies. “We are digitizing a large amount of the permitting process, aiming to have a complete digital process during the next two years,” Daniel Gastélum, director of the local economic development agency said during the summit. The Road Ahead The future of Hermosillo’s BPO sector hinges on how it addresses its challenges while continuing to capitalize on its strengths. The focus on technological integration, a strong local workforce and strategic market positioning offers potential for meaningful growth. As Caire stated: “Our commitment to improving and adapting is not just about survival; it is about thriving in a competitive landscape.” With a unified approach, Hermosillo could solidify its reputation as a viable, dynamic player in the global BPO arena.

Last week, the U.S. revoked his visa. The state department told NPR visa records are confidential and cannot be discussed publicly. Arias said workers at the U.S. embassy in Costa Rica informed him the action had been taken over his close ties to the Chinese government. Arias has been critical of U.S. President Donald Trump and earlier this year compared him to a “Roman emperor.” The Nobel Laureate believes those comments may have led to the decision to revoke his visa. A Shift in Policy Signalling to Arias that he is no longer welcome in the U.S. is the most high-profile example of a noticeable shift in policy from the Trump administration. Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a memo to diplomats asking them to search through the social media accounts of visa applicants. This follows an executive order signed by Trump that jump-started an effort to deport individuals from the country who have “hostile attitudes” toward American values. Trump has also inked an order to reduce antisemitism that has been used to justify the deportation of students protesting against Israel’s military actions in Gaza. On Thursday, Inside Higher Ed reported the state department has modified or revoked more than 600 student visas since the order was signed. Populism in LatAm The left wing in Latin America has historically opposed the influence exerted by the United States in the region. Arias’ goal for peace in 1986 was not helped by the U.S. funding of the right-wing Contra rebels that were causing instability in Nicaragua. After years of political dominance, the left capitulated when the Conservative Wave hit Latin America about 10 years ago, bringing an influx of right-wing leadership to numerous countries. But the branding, this time, was not quite the same as the conservative administrations of years past. Raquel Chanto, a Costa Rican political scientist and Oxford University Ph.D. candidate, cited a global decline in trust as being responsible for the rise of populist leaders in an interview with Yoriko Yasukawa, vice president of the Foundation for Global Governance and Sustainability. “Trust is the philosopher’s stone of political systems, something you can translate into results through legitimacy, buy-in and willingness to cooperate and engage in political agreements,” Chanto said. “Overall, people trust systems that they believe are fair, consistent, open and responsive; where they feel included and heard, and their needs are addressed. That is to say that citizens trust the good government.” Rhetoric vs. Reality Teamstation AI CEO and Co-Founder Lonnie McRorey has lived in Mexico for nine years while operating his nearshore staffing system company. “I think more professionals are trying to stay here — they’re not so eager to go to the U.S.,” he said. “But, look, the dollar still has a very powerful way. There are people here willing to risk everything in their lives to make $300.” McRorey said that the disparity among Mexican nationals creates an interesting dynamic, with the ability for many to have a quality of life at or surpassing what the U.S. offers while still seeing abject poverty and citizens trying to escape the country. “There’s high taxes, no access to health care,” he said of the U.S. “Believe it or not, quality of life in LatAm is better than in the U.S. in many ways.” Latin American reliance on economic support from the United States has waned in recent years as China begins to exert influence in the region. Arias, while Costa Rica’s president, established diplomatic relations with China in 2007. The BRICS economic bloc, originally a partnership between Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, announced in January it was adding nine “partner” nations, which included Bolivia. Additionally, BRICS says it has received interest from Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Uruguay and Venezuela to join the partnership. ‘Sympathy for the Devil’ The U.S. military is taking notice. A report released by the Army-operated Foreign Military Studies Office states that there is an increase in the number of Latin American countries looking to develop significant overseas relations . “This development signals that dictatorships in Latin America see the BRICS grouping as an economic and political lifeline amid difficult economic and diplomatic moments. Relatedly, the inclusion of a greater number of Latin American countries in BRICS will bring China and Russia further into the Western hemisphere, where both have been increasing their influence of late,” the report states. Similarly, a report issued by Irene Mia, a senior fellow for Latin America at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the U.S. should be wary of celebrating its near-term policy victories , such as tackling drug trafficking, before it fully realizes some of the long-term effects its rhetoric toward Latin America may bring. “Without concrete measures to support Latin America’s economic growth and diversification, and to bolster its Democratic institutions, China will remain a dominant economic force in the region,” Mia wrote. “Additionally, trade tariffs and deportations of undocumented migrants to their countries of origin — particularly through the economic blow of lost remittances — will wreak havoc on Latin American economies, making China’s trade and investment even more attractive.” Comment Name *  Email *  Website   Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/costa-ricas-living-costs-rising-despite-low-inflation/,Costa Rica’s Living Costs Rising Despite Low Inflation - Nearshore Americas,2025-04-16T19:41:03+00:00,"Living costs in Costa Rica are rising even as the inflation rate plunges and the local currency, the colón, continues to strengthen.","Living costs in Costa Rica are rising even as inflation plunges and the local currency, the colón, continues to strengthen — an unusual combination that has puzzled economists. The inflation rate fell to a new low of 1.21% in March, down slightly from 1.24% in February. At the same time, a new report from the central bank has reignited debate over whether Costa Rica is, in fact, an expensive country. Authored by economic researcher Melissa Vega, the report compares Costa Rica with Chile in terms of overall living costs. Vega concludes that while Costa Rica may be comparable to Chile, it is considerably more expensive than upper-middle-income countries like Colombia and Mexico. The report indicates that health and education are categories where Costa Rica has remained more expensive than similar countries in Latin America. Though the overall price levels appear to place Costa Rica on par with Chile, a more granular breakdown by product category reveals troubling disparities. The cost differences are especially pronounced in staple food items. Milk, cheese, and eggs in Costa Rica cost between 24% and 26% more than the OECD average and up to 28% more than the Latin American average. Prices for soft drinks and bottled water are 19% to 22% higher than in OECD countries and 29% higher than in Latin America. Even basic items like bread and cereals are 5% to 7% more expensive than in OECD countries and up to 25% more than in Latin America. The price gap widens further in categories such as fruits, vegetables, and potatoes, which are up to 9% costlier than in the OECD and as much as 41% more expensive than in the rest of Latin America. Businessmen are Worried Adolfo Cruz, President of CAMTIC , expressed disappointment at the rising prices. “We’ve lost competitiveness and have become a very expensive country.” The Costa Rican Chamber of Information and Communication Technologies (CAMTIC) is a key organization that represents and promotes the interests of the ICT sector in the country. The surging colón is apparently dealing a double-whammy impact on global services providers operating in the country. Since late 2022, the colón has risen around 30% , climbing from a low of 670 per U.S. dollar to around 500 today. Cruz is also skeptical of the inflation figures published monthly by the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC). He contends that the explanations offered by the agency fail to reflect the lived reality. “Costa Rica risks becoming a destination that only the affluent can afford,” warned Casey Halloran, CEO of Costa Rican Vacations , a travel agency based in the country’s capital, San José. “This isn’t just about currency; structural issues like high food prices, transport costs, and bureaucratic burdens drive prices up.” Employment Costs Halloran is also concerned about the ripple effects of high living costs on payroll expenses. Costa Rica adjusts its minimum wage almost annually, and while the country offers generous incentives to firms operating in its free trade zones, the cost of employment is steep. Employers must contribute approximately 26% of an employee’s salary to social security (including insurance and pensions) — more than double the OECD average of 12% . This translates into significantly higher labor costs for companies operating in Costa Rica. In addition, employers are required to pay a mandatory Christmas bonus, known locally as Aguinaldo — equivalent to one-twelfth of the employee’s total earnings over the previous 12 months — as well as paid vacation leave for those who have worked at least 50 consecutive weeks. Carlos Wong, president of the Free Trade Zones Association (AZOFRAS), highlighted these pressures in comments to local media outlet El Observador . He noted that the strengthening of the colón against the U.S. dollar has sharply increased operating costs. This, he warned, is restricting business expansion and delaying job-creating projects. Wong also referred to the OECD findings, emphasizing that a combination of high energy costs and burdensome operational expenses is weighing on business expansion.

Despite having just 12 employees, Lara AI has made a mark in the Latin American tech landscape with its innovative HR automation platform. Founded in 2021, Lara AI raised $1.1 million in seed funding from Newtopia VC, 500 LatAm, FJ Labs, and Brazil Venture Capital. The platform uses AI to maintain personalized conversations with employees, identifying dissatisfaction and predicting potential resignations. Lara claims its tool can reduce HR workloads by up to 50%, enabling teams to focus more on culture and people without dehumanizing management processes. Led by CEO Guido Kuznicki and CTO Alan Szpigiel, Lara AI has drawn attention for its unique employee engagement approach. The acquisition aligns with Visma’s strategy to expand its footprint in Latin America and integrate advanced AI solutions into its enterprise software suite. Visma, which operates across Europe with a workforce of 16,400, reported US$3.7 billion in revenue for 2024. The acquisition signals growing interest from European firms in Latin America’s fast-evolving tech talent and innovation ecosystem.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/revelo-acquires-alto-as-demand-for-latam-ai-workers-rise/,Alto Merges into Revelo as Demand for AI Devs Accelerates - Nearshore Americas,2025-05-07T22:08:15+00:00,"U.S.-based AI hiring platform Revelo has acquired Alto, a regional competitor that helps American companies hire remote software developers from Latin America.","U.S.-based hiring platform Revelo has acquired Alto amid surging demand for professionals skilled in training large language models. Launched in 2015, Alto transitioned from a remote-first staffing company into a comprehensive tech talent platform. “The merger helps us to scale our mission,” said Juan Salas , co-founder and CTO at Alto. “We built Alto on the belief that Latin America could be a driving force in the AI revolution. I’m proud of what we created, and excited to see that vision continue through Revelo,” Salas said, confirming that both he and his co-founder, Pablo Baldomá Jones , would gain a role in Revelo. “Together, we’re building an end-to-end solution that removes the friction from hiring in Latin America,” Baldomá Jones said. When asked how many Latin American professionals they had placed with U.S. companies, Baldomá estimated “the figure could be somewhere between 800 and 1,000.” Alto’s client list includes 24 Hour Fitness, Anytime Fitness, and BBVA. During the interview, both co-founders acknowledged the sharp increase in demand for AI talent . “The demand for AI-literate developers — especially those who can contribute to complex post-training work on large language models — is accelerating.” The acquisition significantly expands Revelo’s presence in the region and marks its fifth deal in just 30 months, underscoring its rapid growth strategy. Revelo stated that, following the acquisition, the total number of professionals on its platform has reached 400,000. According to Revelo, companies are competing to secure talent capable of enhancing large language models for advanced tasks such as coding. Hiring related to large language model training accounted for 22% of Revelo’s revenue in 2024, according to Spanish news outlets, and analysts believe this share is likely to increase. This growth is driven by companies developing their own AI models and seeking specialized engineers and datasets to train them. They require human input to interact with machines and validate the generated code. “It is simply impossible to hire developers at scale without the help of platforms like Alto,” Salas said, with Baldomá Jones adding that hiring Latin American talent involves extensive backend processes such as identifying and vetting candidates. Salas dismissed the notion that automation in software development would diminish the demand for IT talent. Instead, he emphasized that companies are actually scaling up their operations and increasing their need for skilled professionals.

At the China-CELAC Forum in Beijing, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , Colombian President Gustavo Petro, and Chilean President Gabriel Boric are set to engage in discussions to enhance regional cooperation. President Lula’s visit aims to expand Brazil’s exports of soybeans, meats, and minerals to China, capitalizing on opportunities arising from U.S.-China trade tensions . This visit marks his third meeting with President Xi Jinping since 2023, reflecting deepening bilateral ties. Meanwhile, Colombia’s President Petro announced the country’s accession to China’s Belt and Road Initiative, focusing on infrastructure development and technological advancement. This move underscores Colombia’s pursuit of diversified partnerships beyond traditional U.S. alliances. China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi emphasized Latin America’s right to self-determination, subtly critiquing U.S. policies reminiscent of the Monroe Doctrine. He highlighted China’s commitment to mutual respect and non-interference in the region’s affairs. Economic ties between Brazil and China have intensified, with bilateral trade reaching $157.62 billion in the first ten months of 2024. China remains Brazil’s largest trading partner , importing significant volumes of soybeans, iron ore, and oil. This strategic realignment indicates a broader trend of Latin American nations seeking diversified economic partnerships, balancing relations between major global powers.

The $15.2 billion deal will make NTT Data a wholly owned subsidiary, giving NTT full control over its IT services arm. This move builds on a 2022 restructuring that placed NTT’s overseas operations under NTT Data, establishing it as the centerpiece of the group’s international IT solutions business. However, overlapping capital structures have hindered fast decision-making , especially around major data center investments driven by rising demand for generative AI. NTT President and CEO Akira Shimada cited governance challenges, including conflicts of interest from dual stock listings and a convoluted decision-making process, as key reasons for the acquisition. He emphasized that the new structure will allow better accountability and smoother allocation of management resources. NTT Data’s core services include IT solutions and data center operations for domestic and global clients. Its overseas presence is particularly strong in Latin America , where it supports public and private sector digital transformation in countries like Brazil, Argentina, and Chile, offering solutions in finance, healthcare, and smart cities.

The expansion comes after the company announced plans to hire more than 200 programmers over the next two years. The company said in a statement that the Santa Cruz location is designed to attract local bilingual talent and integrate multidisciplinary teams that will work on international projects under the nearshoring model. “Santa Cruz has a dynamic business ecosystem and enormous technological potential. With this new office, we seek to strengthen our presence in the region and continue recruiting highly qualified talent,” said Daniel Gumucio, chief executive officer of AssureSoft. The Bolivian team will work for the company’s clients in the United States, Canada and Europe. In the meantime, AssureSoft has launched training programs for newly graduated engineers, providing them with technical training, English language skills and cultural skills to integrate into international teams. “We have historically established partnerships with the best universities in Bolivia, and we also have internship programs that we will continue to promote in engineering schools,” Gumucio said. The approach seeks to level the playing field of Bolivian professionals and prepare them for the challenges presented by ever-changing global technology. AssureSoft was founded in 2006 by Daniel Gumucio in Cochabamba, Bolivia, with a vision of exporting talent and software services. Over the past five years, it has maintained annual growth of 35%. Since its inception, the company has focused on custom software development and engineering team building. It currently has engineering teams in several Bolivian cities (Cochabamba, La Paz, Santa Cruz, Potosí, Oruro, and Tarija), as well as offices in Paraguay and the United States.

Other key centers include Belmopan and San Ignacio. Most companies in the sector cater to U.S. and Canadian clients, offering services such as customer support, data entry, and financial outsourcing.

Geopolitical friction is already disrupting global supply chains and leaving customer service teams scrambling to manage the fallout. This is one of the key discussion areas at next week’s CXOutsourcers ‘Mindshare” Forum , in Munich, Germany. In this context of uncertainty, we sat down with Peter Ryan , founder of Ryan Strategic Advisory, to delve into the current opportunities and challenges shaping the global customer experience (CX) landscape. Ryan is a founding member of CXOutsourcers, which annually hosts the Mindshare Event — an industry gathering focused on assessing the global CX and BPO sectors. Designed specifically for Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) professionals, the forum is geared toward empowering C-suite executives with research and strategic insights to drive business performance. More than 120 CX leaders from across the globe are expected to attend. Below are excerpts from the interview with Peter Ryan. NSAM: What advice would you give to contact center providers who are heavily reliant on U.S. customers, especially now that the geopolitical order has shifted under President Donald Trump? Ryan: First, I’d say — don’t panic. Anyone considering the U.S. market shouldn’t abandon it entirely. Yes, there’s a lot of confusion right now. The next few months are going to be political — shaping the direction of what the U.S. plans to do, and how its trade and tariff policies play out. But at this stage, it’s anyone’s guess. There’s still immense value in the U.S. from an outsourcing perspective. So, I’d tell anyone eyeing the U.S. as a potential market: stay clear-eyed, observe closely, but don’t write it off. NSAM: Contact center providers serving U.S. customers seem to be in serious trouble these days, especially with the dollar index plunging to 99. Anything below 100 could deal a devastating blow to providers that are heavily dependent on U.S. clients. How do you suggest they tackle this crisis? Ryan: Well, there’s a lot of volatility out there. Strategic planning is key. Providers must work with people who understand currency fluctuations and risk management — people who can hedge against currency risk using the right tools. Now, while the dollar has appreciated and other currencies have weakened, that may actually benefit offshore providers. For buyers in the U.S., outsourcing just became cheaper. So, depending on how the currency arbitrage plays out, this could increase the appeal of offshore destinations — making U.S. companies more inclined to spend. NSAM: You once told us that most people still prefer speaking to a human rather than a machine in contact centers. So, AI bots wouldn’t be as successful as we initially expected. But these days, many BPOs are deploying chatbots — and laying off human agents. Do you still hold that view, or should service providers adapt and embrace AI? Ryan: I don’t believe there’s a massive wave of agents losing their jobs due to AI. Our research shows that while there has been some displacement, it’s mostly roles that were bound to be automated anyway — like changing an address, or resetting a password. What we’re really seeing now is AI being used to enable agents, not replace them. Yes, some contact centers are moving toward automation or AI-driven models. But I don’t think we’ll see a full-scale shift — at least not in the near or medium term. Maybe in the long term, depending on how you define that. There’s been a lot of hype over the last two and a half years about what AI can do. But when it comes to generative AI in customer service, the hype hasn’t fully matched the delivery — at least, not yet. NSAM: Stock prices of major voice-based BPO providers have taken a hit in recent months. Investors seem to believe that AI bots will take over the customer service industry. What’s your take on this, as an industry analyst? Ryan: You have to look at what triggered the drop in stock prices. It started when a Scandinavian fintech company announced they were shifting all customer service work to AI bots. Naturally, that spooked the outsourcing market. But interestingly, that same fintech recently reversed its decision — bringing the work back to human agents. Why? Because the AI tech simply wasn’t mature enough to deliver the kind of customer experience they needed. So yes, stock price movements are a concern, and investor expectations are clearly a big part of that. But I think we’re now seeing a rebalancing — a recalibration — of how the market perceives AI’s role in CX. NSAM: We recently met the owner of a contact center firm in India. He suggested that service providers should look for countries where agents can speak multiple languages. That way, they can serve a diverse customer base from a single site. He also said new technologies make it easier to handle different accents. Do you think that’s a useful strategy? Ryan: It’s definitely a valid suggestion. In fact, there are already several multilingual hubs around the world doing exactly that. We also have advanced tools now — from automatic translation to accent neutralization — that make multilingual service much more seamless. But the key thing to understand is: there’s no one-size-fits-all strategy. The right approach depends on the company, the industry it’s in, and the markets it serves. So while multilingual hubs are valuable, companies need to align their CX strategy with their specific business goals and customer demographics. NSAM: Which country do you think is making a significant mark in the CX services sector globally? Ryan: The Philippines is doing a fantastic job — as is India. These two are consistently among the most highly rated and preferred destinations by buyers, according to our research. South Africa and Egypt are also standouts. In Latin America, Mexico is a strong favorite, along with Colombia. And in the Caribbean, Jamaica has always impressed us. I was genuinely pleased with what I saw recently during an event hosted by the Jamaican outsourcing sector. In Central and Eastern Europe, there are great success stories coming out of Albania, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria. So, I wouldn’t say there’s one country that’s head and shoulders above the rest. Instead, what we’re seeing is each country carving out its own niche — finding its sweet spot in the industry. The key is that quality locations are stepping up, refining their game, and striving to deliver the best experiences and outcomes. NSAM: What can these executives expect to learn if they participate in the CXOutsourcers’ event in Munich? Why is it important not to miss it? Ryan: This event is crucial for anyone who wants to understand the future of CX — and how outsourcers must pivot to stay competitive through 2025 and into 2026. We’ll dive into key topics like geopolitical disruption, digital transformation, and emerging technologies. We’ll also explore how outsourcing firms can position themselves as influential players — not just vendors — in their respective ecosystems. Plus, we’ll examine new opportunities in emerging verticals and markets. It’s going to be packed with valuable insights. Any executive who wants to stay ahead of the curve simply shouldn’t miss it.

https://latamlist.com/the-new-wave-of-startup-scams-what-founders-need-to-watch-out-for/,The New Wave of Startup Scams: What Founders Need to Watch Out For,2025-04-21T22:38:37+00:00,Check out a quick breakdown of the newer — and increasingly creative — scams founders need to watch for.,"The harsh fundraising climate in Latin America is creating a perfect storm. Founders are under pressure. Venture cycles are slower. There’s more noise, less signal. And where there’s uncertainty, bad actors thrive. Here’s a quick breakdown of the newer — and increasingly creative — scams founders need to watch for. The promise is tempting: “You’ve been selected to pitch in front of top-tier VCs at our exclusive demo day.” But before you get there, there’s always a catch — a “small application fee,” a “presentation coaching fee,” or worse, a required “sponsorship” payment to secure your spot. These operations often have slick branding and recognizable VC logos (often used without permission) on their landing pages. Some even fabricate testimonials from founders who supposedly raised money at previous events. What to watch for: Not all convertible notes are created equal. We’ve seen a rise in what we call “Predatory Convertible Notes.” These are investment offers that look legit — often backed by real contracts and lawyers — but include toxic terms that can cripple your startup later on. Common red flags: These terms often come from so-called family offices or international angel groups that are hard to diligence. In this version, a supposed VC associate reaches out saying they’re doing “preliminary diligence” on behalf of a partner. They ask for your pitch deck, cap table, even financials, projections, and customer lists — claiming it’s a precondition to a real meeting. Once you send the info? Silence. We suspect some of these fake profiles are harvesting data for other purposes — whether to resell lists or benchmark your idea for competitive reasons. How to stay safe: This one’s especially insidious. Founders are told they’ve been awarded a non-dilutive grant or prize. Sounds great, until you read the fine print: you need to wire a “processing fee” or pay local taxes upfront to release the funds. To make things worse, these scammers often send official-looking “letters of award” complete with seals, legal jargon, and even fake lawyer names to co-sign. Remember: Real grants don’t charge winners. They deduct fees from disbursements, if at all. And they always allow for tax compliance post-funding. A new twist we’ve seen: corporates or “strategic partners” offer to invest or license your product, but push aggressively to review your code base, algorithms, or confidential tech before anything’s signed. In some cases, the startup gets ghosted after handing over sensitive data. In others, they discover a similar product launched months later. In this climate, staying skeptical isn’t paranoia — it’s strategy. The golden rule still applies: If someone wants you to wire money before they wire money, it’s probably a scam. But even beyond that, founders need to: At PAG Law, we built Grow to help founders avoid exactly these types of traps. Grow gives startups access to vetted investor databases, secure deal tools, and US venture legal support — all designed with Latin founders in mind. Platforms don’t close rounds. But they can help founders spot the real players — and steer clear of the frauds. Scammers are getting smarter. But so are founders. If something feels off, it probably is. Slow down. Ask questions. Trust your gut. And when in doubt, don’t go it alone. Reach out to people who’ve been in the trenches.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/argentina-pulls-back-from-the-edge-as-mileis-shock-therapy-delivers/,Milei’s Shock Therapy Puts Argentina on a Path of Recovery - Nearshore Americas,2025-04-30T18:27:07+00:00,Argentina’s battered economy is finally showing signs of revival. President Javier Milei’s radical “shock therapy” is beginning to bear fruit.,"Argentina’s battered economy is finally showing signs of revival. President Javier Milei’s radical “ shock therapy ” is beginning to bear fruit. The fiscal rebound is already visible in the stock market — often viewed as the pulse of the economy. The MERVAL index, Argentina’s benchmark, surged by a staggering 172% in local currency terms in 2024. Economic activity is also gaining traction. As of February, output rose 5.7% year-on-year — marking the fourth consecutive month of growth and the strongest pace since June 2022. The IMF expects the country to register 5.5% growth for 2025. According to President Milei, the economy is expanding at an ‘unadjusted’ annual rate of 10%. This turnaround didn’t happen by chance. It came only after Milei took aim at two of Argentina’s most entrenched problems: a volatile currency and runaway inflation. The Shock Therapy During his election campaign, Milei wielded a symbolic chainsaw, vowing to slash public spending. Once in office, he fulfilled his promise. Austerity hit like a hammer blow. Within months, real public spending was slashed by 30%, as the President cut subsidies for gas, electricity, and other public utilities. More than 36,000 public sector employees were laid off. Twelve ministries were eliminated. Four others — Education, Labor, Social Development, and Culture — were merged into a single super-ministry called Human Capital. Initially, the shock therapy lived up to its name — shocking even the president. For weeks, Buenos Aires’ international airport appeared eerily empty. Trains and subways fell silent. Garbage piled up on the streets as thousands of public workers went on strike in protest. Yet beneath the mounting social tension, the economic logic began to take hold. Inflation, which had soared to nearly 300% annually , finally began to fall. Next came a wave of deregulation. The Milei administration eliminated state controls, including those on house rent and consumer prices. As supply increased, rents dropped over a matter of months. “I lived a year in Argentina in the mid-2010s, and the economy at that time was in a terrible state — shortages, currency controls, out-of-control inflation, clogged ports — you name it. I was not optimistic about it ever turning around,” said Fergus Hodgson, Director at Econ Americas , a US-based financial consultancy, and author of The Latin America Red Pill . Hodgson, however, disagrees with labeling Milei’s policies as “shock therapy.” “He cannot — and has not — enacted the kind of shock therapy he would ideally like to. Still, he has generated many positive outcomes in just a year and a half.” Devaluing Currency Still, many economists argue Milei’s decision to devalue the peso was a textbook case of shock therapy. The president devalued the official exchange rate by more than 50% — a bold move to align it more closely with the black-market “blue dollar” rate. Rather than defending the peso through artificial means, the government allowed market forces to set its value. This began restoring investor confidence and gradually squeezed out parallel currency markets. The result was dramatic. By the end of 2024, inflation had plunged to 118% — a drop of 44.5 percentage points in just one year. The decline continued. By March 2025, annual inflation had fallen to 55.9%. Projections suggest it could dip below 30% before the year ends. To attract foreign investment, his government introduced the RIGI regime — a landmark policy that offers 30 years of fiscal and regulatory stability, tax cuts, and trade incentives for large-scale projects (above $200 million). The framework protects investors against adverse policy shifts and guarantees compensation if these protections are violated. By February 2025, the results were beginning to show. At least 10 energy projects worth a combined $11.593 billion had been submitted under the new regime. In mining, six projects totaling nearly $15 billion were in the pipeline. In April, Milei secured a $20 billion loan from the IMF to support his market-oriented reforms and the dismantling of years of currency and capital controls.

https://latamlist.com/raising-money-in-the-u-s-heres-what-founders-need-to-know-about-securities-laws/,Raising Money in the U.S.? Here’s What Founders  Need to Know About Securities Laws,2025-05-05T15:00:00+00:00,"If you’re a startup raising money from U.S. investors, you should understand the basics of U.S. laws that will apply to your raise.","If you’re a startup raising money from U.S. investors, whether through a SAFE, convertible note, or even token sales, you should understand the basics of U.S. laws that will apply to your raise. Here’s the short version: almost everything you sell or “issue” to investors is considered a “security” under U.S. law. And unless you register the offering with the SEC (which is basically an IPO-level headache), you must qualify for an exemption. Otherwise, you are in violation of the law, subject to a range of penalties we’ll discuss below. Founders love moving fast. But raising money without following securities rules can get you sued and scared off future investors. If you issue securities without registration or an applicable exemption, investors can demand their money back (plus interest). The SEC can fine you or ban you from raising again. And even if regulators don’t show up, sloppy compliance can kill your next round or acquisition. Lawyers for VCs and acquirers will ask tough questions—and if your answers are not airtight, your deal might not close. The U.S. has two layers of securities regulation: federal (the SEC) and state (“blue sky” laws). Most federal exemptions override state registration, but you may still need to do notice filings and pay fees in every state where your investors reside. Regulation D is the lifeblood of U.S. startup fundraising and is what makes most venture rounds legal. All Reg D offerings require a Form D filing with the SEC within 15 days of the first sale in the round. There are two main Reg D flavors: This is what most VC-backed startups use. Want to promote your round publicly? This is your exemption. But: every investor must be accredited, and you need to verify it (not just take their word for it). However, per recent SEC guidance released in March 2025: If someone invests $200K+ (or $1M+ if they’re an entity), and represents that they are not using debt to invest, this satisfies the obligation to verify investor accreditation —no third-party checks needed. Rule 504 lets you raise up to $10 million, but it doesn’t override state laws. That means more filings, more complexity, and often no real benefit over 506(b). For this reason, Rule 504 is rarely used, and we almost never recommend this route for startups. Reg CF: Online Capital from a Broad Investor Base Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) is how you legally raise from the general public—customers, fans, your mom. Pro tip: Some founders pair a Reg CF with a traditional VC round to offer a slice to fans or customers without messing up their cap table. This is especially common among consumer-facing brands that want to include their community in their raise. Reg A+ sits between private rounds and a full-blown IPO. This is the old-school exemption, used before Reg D existed. It’s vague and risky if you don’t know what you’re doing. Unlike Reg D, no federal preemption applies, so companies may need to register with state securities regulators, in addition to the notice filings done in connection with Reg D rounds. Companies should use this only in very narrow cases, like insider rounds or founder equity grants. Otherwise, stick with Reg D. If your investors are based outside the U.S., Reg S is your friend. Fundraising is hard enough. Don’t add legal landmines to the mix. Whether you’re closing a friends-and-family round, pitching U.S. VCs, or launching a Reg CF campaign, getting the legal setup right now will save you a world of pain later. You only get one chance to make a good impression with investors. Make sure your raise is as professional as your pitch deck.

After two years of volunteering, Fraser joined Vistaprint in 2003 as an HR leader, helping the company expand into Jamaica. That experience opened her eyes to the hurdles foreign businesses often face when setting up shop in the region, from recruiting local talent to managing wage expectations and understanding government incentives. “Vistaprint did a fantastic job, but it was so much work, trial and error,” Fraser said. “It kind of developed a desire in me to help other companies to not have to go through that.” By 2010, she had started her own call center, which grew to about 50 employees before financial limitations forced her to reposition. She launched an HR outsourcing firm , assisting other companies with their Caribbean operations, often stepping in as the official employer of record. Her company has since had a major impact on Jamaica’s BPO sector, which has grown from around 5,000 workers twenty years ago to about 60,000 today. As a part of that growth, her team recruited over 1,100 employees for ibex, a major BPO company. From the ground up Entrepreneurship is essential across the Caribbean, but it comes along with well-established risks. Small- and medium-sized enterprises make up 99.5% of businesses and provide about 60% of formal jobs, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Nevertheless, these businesses often struggle to get financing, secure collateral, or tap into robust capital markets. “Banks want assets. If you don’t have property, it’s hard to grow,” Fraser said. “There aren’t many grants or angel investors here. I’ve thought about registering my business elsewhere just to access capital.” Jamaica has improved its business climate in recent years and now ranks 71st in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index. After four decades of little to no improvement, the island is expected to see 1 to 2% annual growth over the medium term, according to World Bank Group. Mortgage rates have come down from 17% to about 8%, and the Jamaican dollar is seeing some stability amid a weakening U.S. dollar, Fraser said. Still, many startups have no choice but to bootstrap. Fraser considers herself lucky that she was able to use family-owned land as leverage to secure funding for her endeavors. Today, her company serves clients around the world and specializes in remote-first hiring. This approach eliminates the need for expensive office space by finding skilled workers for businesses that operate virtually — a trend that gained momentum during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Our clients cut 70% off labor costs by hiring in Jamaica,” she said. “And they’re getting high-quality workers with years of BPO experience. It’s a no-brainer.” Fraser believes smaller firms like hers are well-suited to succeed, especially as larger BPO providers deal with increasing costs. She also points to rising competition from gig economy platforms like Fiverr and Upwork, which attract Caribbean freelancers but don’t contribute to local tax systems. “The gig economy is already here,” Fraser said. “But if you’re not on a payroll, you can’t access benefits like Jamaica’s housing trust. That’s a missed opportunity for both workers and the country.” The fight to stay competitive Nearby, countries like Trinidad and Tobago are pouring money into the sector — more than $245 million — to create thousands of new jobs. With strong English language skills and proximity to the U.S., the Caribbean takes advantage of the typical nearshore selling points. But Fraser warns that to stay competitive, the region needs better policies, more funding opportunities, and stronger digital infrastructure. “The labor is here, the skills are here,” she said. “What we need now is better support for the people building the future from the ground up.” According to the Global Services Association of Jamaica, about 70 companies make up the country’s BPO sector. And while some worry artificial intelligence could replace jobs, GSAJ President Wayne Sinclair believes technology could improve productivity and lead to new roles. The global services sector remains a major job engine, with a 61.5% jump in employment over the past eight years, according to Minister of Industry, Investment and Commerce Senator Aubyn Hill.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/the-six-countries-where-taxes-wont-crush-you/,The Six Countries Where Taxes Won’t Crush You - Nearshore Americas,2025-05-15T16:37:09+00:00,Latin America offers lawful and strategic avenues to significantly reduce your tax liability—sometimes to nearly zero.,"While certain Latin American countries do levy substantial taxes, there are lawful and strategic avenues to significantly reduce tax liability, sometimes to nearly zero. This is particularly true in jurisdictions that operate under a territorial tax system, where income earned outside the country is entirely exempt from local taxation . Expatriates can fully enjoy the local lifestyle and amenities without being taxed on their foreign earnings. In some cases, foreigners can even retain non-resident status while continuing to benefit from the country’s infrastructure, climate and community offerings. For Americans relocating to these nations, the advantages are twofold: they can legally minimize exposure to U.S. income taxes through established IRS mechanisms, while also benefiting from lower living costs and the natural beauty that many of these countries offer. In fact, certain Latin American jurisdictions have income tax regimes that rival even those of low-tax hubs like Dubai. By deriving income from foreign employment or operating an offshore business, it’s not uncommon to find a minimal local income tax burden by the end of the year. Corporate tax policies in the region are equally attractive. Guatemala, for instance, levies just a 7% corporate tax, making it one of the most favorable jurisdictions for business in Latin America. Paraguay is another standout, capping corporate taxes at 10%. U.S. citizens are taxed on their worldwide income, regardless of residency. However, mechanisms like the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion and the Foreign Tax Credit can mitigate double taxation. Here is a closer look at some of these countries and the tax advantages they offer: Uruguay Often praised for its high personal safety standards , Uruguay also boasts natural beauty and a pleasant climate. Its tax policies are highly favorable, especially for foreign professionals. For those in software or other skilled sectors, Uruguay will be an ideal country to live in. The government offers a 10-year tax holiday on foreign income, allowing many expats to legally avoid paying any income tax for an entire decade. Local income is taxed at just 12%, and even tax residents find the burden comparatively light when measured against developed nations. Some foreign residents choose to permanently settle in Uruguay, giving up the tax holiday in exchange for a reduced 7% tax rate on their foreign income — an option exclusively available to non-natives. Chile Chile stands out as one of the more affluent countries in Latin America. Holding a Chilean passport grants visa-free access to numerous countries, including the United States. Chile provides a three-year tax exemption on foreign income, with a possible extension to six years. After five years of residency, individuals are eligible to apply for citizenship. The Dominican Republic The Dominican Republic offers a three-year tax holiday, and it does not tax income earned from foreign employment. For those working for an overseas company while living in the country, there are no income tax liabilities. That said, the Dominican Republic follows a semi-territorial tax system. This means that while employment income from abroad is exempt, some domestic earnings, such as rental income and capital gains, are subject to taxation. Importantly, the Dominican Republic does not enforce Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) rules. This is a key advantage for international entrepreneurs. Under current Dominican tax law, individuals and businesses are not required to pay tax on the retained earnings of their foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Dominican Republic offers a citizenship-by-investment pathway. By investing in local real estate, you can become eligible for a Dominican passport. You may also qualify for tax residency simply by living in the country for more than six months in a year. Panama Panama operates under a strict territorial tax system, allowing foreign residents to legally avoid taxes on any income earned outside the country. This makes it a compelling destination for remote workers and international entrepreneurs. Residency is accessible — staying in Panama for more than six months in rented accommodation makes you eligible to apply. Beyond its favorable tax laws, Panama is known for its modern infrastructure, stability, and peaceful lifestyle, making it a long-time favorite among expats . Guatemala While Guatemala may lack the high-end infrastructure of other countries, its tax policies are highly attractive to foreign nationals. The country does not tax foreign income, offering a clear incentive for remote workers and offshore business owners. Even local income is taxed at just 7%, making Guatemala one of the most tax-efficient countries in Central America. For those looking to establish an offshore business, Guatemala presents a cost-effective and tax-friendly environment. Paraguay Paraguay stands out as one of the best options for launching an offshore business in Latin America. The country not only exempts foreign income from taxation but also maintains one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the region — just 10%. Both personal and corporate taxes are capped at 10%, providing an exceptionally simple and attractive framework for international investors and business owners. Paraguay also adheres to a territorial tax system, ensuring that all income earned outside the country is completely tax-free . Combined with its ease of business incorporation and high personal safety, Paraguay is a prime destination for those seeking long-term financial efficiency.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/a-domestic-bpo-sees-plenty-of-reasons-to-be-positive/,A Domestic BPO Sees Plenty of Reasons to Be Positive - Nearshore Americas,2025-05-15T19:09:16+00:00,"When U.S. President Donald Trump captured the White House in 2016, his economic agenda was made crystal clear: Bring more jobs back to America. Plenty of onshore BPO executives are still waiting to see this become a reality. Trump's ""America First"" platform has had its share of wins over the years, but most of those","When U.S. President Donald Trump captured the White House in 2016, his economic agenda was made crystal clear: Bring more jobs back to America. Plenty of onshore BPO executives are still waiting to see this become a reality. Trump’s “America First” platform has had its share of wins over the years, but most of those victories have centered around the manufacturing industry, and contact centers are still looking for a life raft. Estimates suggest about 300,000 U.S. jobs are “lost” to offshoring annually , according to data from Radix. A 2017 executive order, entitled the America First Tax Relief Plan , signed by Trump during his first term, sought to subject “profits that have accumulated offshore to a one-time low tax rate, thereby ending the tax incentive to keep those profits offshore.” The plan could have been the much-needed support domestic BPOs were looking for, but, Thomas Laird, CEO of Erie, Pennsylvania-based Expivia , a 600-seat contact center, said the idea never fully came to fruition. To be honest, I’m just a little disappointed,” he said. “You know, I would love to see some of (those jobs) come back onshore with the understanding that it would not just boost onshore, but also boost how quickly AI gets implemented. … It would be a win-win from that standpoint.” Cultural advantage still sells Despite the lack of policy wins at the federal level, Laird still feels domestic BPOs will remain viable for years to come — first and foremost due to the cultural advantage they provide for customers that, by and large, want to speak to fellow countrymen for customer support. “We’re proud of being a USA contact center,” he said. “I think the quality aspects — and I don’t really shy away from this — are much better. … We’ve seen study after study, and we’ve done our own studies, where it’s 70 to 80% of USA customers prefer to talk to somebody from the States.” While AI will continue to be a disruptor in the market, Laird said he still expects advertising campaigns to be launched in the future promoting human-based service over robotic support, similar to how many U.S. banks are increasingly branding as human-first in a digital world. “We just assume that every organization is going to go with AI. I think for certain things — 911 call centers, health care — there’s still going to be an appetite for the human being,” he said. The price is right As jobs continue to move offshore and Latin America continues to increase in popularity for U.S. clients looking to save money, Laird said BPO employee pay is beginning to consolidate in some forms across the globe. He specifically mentioned a dramatic rise in hiring costs in the United States’ nearshore market. “We’re never going to compete with offshore prices,” he said. “But we can relatively compete with nearshore prices as those have really skyrocketed, relatively speaking to where they’ve been, based on the technology that we can provide now.” Laird said agents at his Pennsylvania-based company are paid about $15 to $17 an hour, while supervisors are being paid $20-plus. He said contact centers tend to find success in the U.S. in areas that have low minimum wage, such as Pennsylvania’s $7.25 an hour limit, and areas that are not heavily taxed. This, typically, leads him to view medium-sized cities in rural areas — such as the Rust Belt that Expivia operates in — as being prime markets due to the size of the labor pool and lack of financial disincentives. Laird said the jobs are desirable because they are remote work and offer wages similar to what retail operations would demand in similar markets. Looking ahead, Laird said he believes AI adoption will likely lead to contact center agents being paid some of the “highest wages in the company,” to handle some of the most complex issues for customers that AI cannot handle independently. But he warned that, by and large, the industry does not have the necessary infrastructure built yet for full-scale AI adoption and feels many executives have jumped the gun and made unsuccessful attempts at using the technology to implement cost-cutting measures too soon. He expects many of those concerns to be waning by 2027, provided companies are taking a serious approach to building knowledge bases right now. Laird also noted the added security concerns that AI adoption will pose in the BPO world, including concerns surrounding data use in large language models. “There’s still a lot of things that need to be worked out with security,” he said.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/aws-mexico-explained-a-new-tech-cornerstone-in-mexico/,AWS Mexico Explained: A New Tech Cornerstone in Mexico - Nearshore Americas,2025-02-06T16:55:16+00:00,"""I believe the new Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud 'region' will bring a lot to Mexico and all its industries,"" says David Victoria, a Senior Cloud Architect for Caylent in Latin America and one of the main ambassadors of Amazon's newest technology project. ""However, I still think there's many things to ask Santa for."" Querétaro","“I believe the new Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud ‘region’ will bring a lot to Mexico and all its industries,” says David Victoria , a Senior Cloud Architect for Caylent in Latin America and one of the main ambassadors of Amazon’s newest technology project. “However, I still think there’s many things to ask Santa for.” Querétaro is the second Latin American city to host an AWS Region, following São Paulo. This Region, with three Availability Zones accessible via the API code mx-central-1 , will offer low-latency cloud services, enhanced data sovereignty, and increased opportunities for digital transformation. It expands upon Amazon’s existing Local Zone (smaller-scale data center deployments) in Querétaro and Points of Presence (PoPs, which are caché storing edge locations) in Monterrey, Puebla, Tlalnepantla, Tlaquepaque, Torreón and Querétaro. The news comes at a time when costs for software development in Mexico are increasingly becoming less of an advantage. Fortunately, the AWS region addresses the remaining two factors of the “Iron Triangle” in nearshoring IT services. With cost competitiveness fading, the industry is now prioritizing faster delivery and higher-quality end products. According to Mexican Tech Expert Enrique Cortés-Rello , AWS Mexico has contributed significantly to boost the region’s tech ecosystem. “It consolidates the country as the region’s main technology hub. More cloud computing infrastructure means a stronger appeal for business and a wider array of available computing tools for companies, entrepreneurs, governments, and academia.” The US tech giant has recently announced plans to invest $5 billion in Mexico over the next 15 years. This investment is expected to create 7,000 jobs and contribute $10 billion to the country’s GDP. This investment also promises to boost the nation’s digital future. The cloud initiative’s hardware and software are being implemented alongside a comprehensive community building program and robust sustainability protocols and projects. These initiatives demonstrate the company’s awareness of protests in Latin America surrounding data center deployment and environmental concerns. According to David, the program includes: Most sustainability strategies appear to have a long-term focus, leaving uncertainty about whether AWS can respond swiftly and effectively to the pressing challenges in cloud and AI development. That said, the AWS Mexico Region has introduced initiatives to promote STEM education and provide targeted support for women and children pursuing careers in IT. Among the most significant efforts is a $300,000 fund dedicated to advancing technology-focused community projects in Querétaro. “In the past, businesses had to purchase expensive hardware, install it on-premises, and maintain it themselves,” says David. “With cloud computing, companies can rent infrastructure on demand, scaling up or down as needed, without large upfront costs.” AWS Availability Zones provide a robust platform for complex code loading, execution, testing, and development. This results in faster application performance, a better user experience, and new opportunities for industries dependent on real-time computing. These benefits extend beyond Mexico; having AWS data centers geographically closer should reduce friction in client experience and enhance software design capabilities. AWS offers Amazon Connect, a cloud-based call center solution that streamlines communication and improves service quality. David explained that, with the impact of a local AWS Region on the available digital infrastructure landscape, call centers can anticipate lower call drop rates and improved voice quality, reduced latency for real-time customer interactions, and increased scalability, enabling businesses to adjust resources according to demand. For developers and tech companies exporting services internationally, utilizing a local cloud region offers numerous advantages. “We say ‘cloud is your new local’,” David remarks, emphasizing that the infrastructure provided by AWS includes a sophisticated, extensive, and unique coding toolkit designed to support the majority of software development needs. From a business perspective, this translates to faster development cycles, achieved through testing and deploying software closer to end-users; lower costs compared to hosting services in distant regions; and facilitated global expansion via a multi-region cloud architecture. Both providers and consumers in the nearshore model will benefit from the ability to extend their service offerings to industries demanding high data sovereignty or low-latency standards previously unattainable. Organizations in sectors like banking, government, and healthcare can now leverage cloud services to achieve their objectives, overcoming regulatory hurdles that previously mandated in-country data hosting. However, there comes David’s most serious critique of the AWS Region: “Unfortunately, it doesn’t come with all the functions”. Take Hardware Security Modules : a high-level, coding-heavy security procedure used to record, archive and utilize sensitive data. It is now standard for a lot of licensing on cybersecurity. “Yet it is not available to utilize for the AWS Mexico Region. It is a function of data infrastructure that has been deployed in other AWS regions.” Cortés-Rello explained it’s common for different cloud service regions to include different services. “It depends on hardware and software implemented on the region’s data centers. For example, US Regions provide services aligned with HIPAA (US health regulation standards). That is not that important for us.” David expressed his hope that this exclusion is only temporary. He emphasized the lack of logic in omitting high-end security functions, particularly given the rise of increasingly complex cyberattacks and widespread concerns about data safety, especially when deploying technology designed to create faster, better products that aim to bolster digital sovereignty. AWS’s expansion into Mexico is more than just an investment in infrastructure—it’s a gateway to digital transformation for businesses of all sizes. While the project may not yet be flawless, and while it may present sustainability challenges, it undeniably demonstrates that long-term, focused private investment can, at times, drive greater resources toward digital transformation than government initiatives. Collaboration between the two can further accelerate the region’s pursuit of competitiveness in digital markets. With the offer of lower latency, improved security, and sustainable computing, Amazon’s move can accelerate cloud adoption across industries. As businesses in Mexico and Latin America embrace cloud technologies, they will be better positioned to compete globally, innovate faster, and reduce operational costs. For companies considering cloud migration, now is the time to take advantage of AWS’s growing presence in Latin America—leveraging world-class cloud services, closer to home. Other experts agree with Victoria and Cortés-Rello on their enthusiasm for the project, noting that it solidifies Querétaro’s position as a host city for “regions” established by all major cloud service providers (Oracle, Google, Microsoft, and AWS). However, they also emphasize the potential for further investment to explore other areas of the web services supply chain. In Cortés-Rello’s words: “investment should now go to creation and not only to cloud services provision. To complement this technological leap, we need investment in startups and advanced R&D in Mexico. We can’t just be consumers. We [as an increasingly leading country in the tech sector] need to turn into creators.” Colombian business, politics, and cultural journalist. Managing Editor for Nearshore Americas and El Enemigo.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/pandemic-shift-reversed-latam-heads-back-to-office/,Pandemic Shift Reversed? LatAm Heads Back to Office - Nearshore Americas,2025-01-21T18:39:50+00:00,"Across Latin America, the remote work revolution appears to be grinding to a halt.","Across Latin America, the remote work revolution appears to be grinding to a halt. As 2025 progresses, offices are reclaiming their dominance, and the work-from-home era looks increasingly like a fleeting pandemic experiment. The region is now leading the world in five-day in-person work, according to a recent JLL real estate consultancy study. Six out of ten companies in the region have already ditched remote arrangements, pulling their workforce back to desks. Peru stands out for its tough stance—remote work is almost extinct. Barely 10% of service sector workers still work from home. Meanwhile, other countries are following suit: Colombia sees 72% of its workforce back in offices, Brazil 60%, Chile 56%, and Mexico 54%. In Peru, of the 764 companies that adopted remote work during the pandemic, a staggering 90% plan to fully return to in-office setups by early 2025, according to ResumeBuilder.com . Real estate lobbying, unmotivated employees, and strict government regulations are collectively casting a shadow over the future of remote work. There are cultural factors also, stated Mark Beyer, founder of Mybey Ventures . “Supervisors in Latin America often prefer direct oversight. Remote work disrupts this dynamic, leaving managers uneasy about accountability and day-to-day control.” In Mexico, many firms have ended remote work due to concerns about decreased productivity and difficulties in maintaining employee oversight. “The culture in Mexico is not one of a lot of trust. Companies feel that during the Pandemic many employees started to abuse the home office situation, not being controlled by the management,” said Peter Kroll , Country Manager for Novacomp in Mexico. “Productivity of many workers went down when working 100% remotely and companies believe this is because there were too many distractions working from home.” Some countries introduced remote work regulations to benefit employees, but ironically, these measures indirectly pressured companies to abandon remote working altogether. In Mexico, for instance, government required companies to pay for home office essentials—chairs, internet, electricity—and take responsibility for employee health and safety at home. “This is difficult to implement,” says Kroll. “Many companies simply don’t want to bear these risks.” The primary argument, says Dionisio Chiuratto Agourakis , CEO of JAI , a São Paulo-based company that offers AI support to boost productivity, is that in-person work is more productive than remote work. “This is especially relevant for junior employees, who miss out on the benefits of being in a physical workplace, such as learning from colleagues, observing workplace dynamics, and improving through direct interactions.” A less-discussed but growing issue, Agourakis said, was  the trend of employees holding multiple full-time remote jobs simultaneously—sometimes as many as three or four—without informing their employers. This behaviour, widely discussed by employees on Reddit and Twitter, has made companies more skeptical about remote work, he added. “In Brazil, some organizations implemented strict measures such as requiring webcams and microphones to be on during work hours, or monitoring keyboard and mouse activity, to ensure productivity.” The Challenge of Retaining Staff With the decline in remote work, retaining employees will become a significant challenge for companies already grappling with talent shortages. In late 2024, workforce analytics firm Revelio uncovered a troubling trend: return-to-office (RTO) policies were shrinking workforces in many organizations. Analyzing hiring and attrition data from public U.S. companies, Revelio found a stark contrast. Since June 2022, when RTO mandates gained momentum, firms offering flexible work have grown their workforce by 1.6%, compared to just 1% growth for companies enforcing in-office attendance. “Yes, companies are aware that they will lose precious talent. But it was inevitable” Agourakis added. Ultimately, companies may need to explore ways to adapt teleworking model to improve employee retention. In a similar JLL survey conducted in 2024 , 62% of respondents said they may plan to create a network of workspaces closer to employees’ homes, aiming to make the transition more appealing and retain talent.

https://latamlist.com/rebalancing-the-cap-table-when-a-founder-leaves-the-band/,Rebalancing the Cap Table When a Founder Leaves the Band,2025-05-12T15:00:00+00:00,Don't miss Juan Pablo Capello's and Julian Constain article on how to rebalance the cap table when a founder leaves,"Starting a company with co-founders is a lot like forming a band. You choose your co-founders because you all share a vision, you’re excited to build something together, and you hope the team sticks around for the world tour. But inevitably, reality sets in. Just like rock bands, founding teams often change. Someone steps back, priorities shift, and suddenly you’re facing a common but tricky issue: “dead equity”, shares held by a founder who’s no longer in actively working in the business, no longer helping drive the company forward. This happens more often than founders expect, and it’s rarely simple to fix. Many founders are blindsided by the legal and financial implications, and even sophisticated investors can grow uneasy if it’s not addressed early and efficiently. Rebalancing the cap table when a founder leaves requires careful planning, open communication, and a solid understanding of the tools available. Here’s how to keep your cap table healthy, your investors happy, and your company on track when the lineup changes. Dead equity means a significant chunk of your company is owned by someone who’s no longer contributing/working in the business. Venture capitalists rightly see this dead equity as a problem, founders who are still building the company resent the dead equity, and when dead equity shows up in your cap table, that dead equity can tank your fundraising efforts. Generally, VCs take issue when 10% or more of the company is dead capital—especially when that’s more than what an active founder owns. Startups are built on trust. When a founder steps away, start with an honest conversation about the impact on the cap table. Don’t avoid this conversation. If you’re lucky, your departing founder will understand why rebalancing the equity is necessary. If not, you’ll need to explain that without a fix, future funding/the future of the company is at risk. If the founder who’s leaving isn’t open to rebalancing the equity—code for giving up some of that dead equity voluntarily , then the company may need to think how to recapitalize the cap table. There’s no one-size-fits-all solution to ‘fix’ the cap table of dead equity, but here are the most practical approaches: A. Secondary Sale to Investors:  Have your lead VC or new investor buy shares directly from the departing founder. This approach is clean and straightforward. The VC gets to their target ownership (usually, around 10%), the departing founder gets some liquidity, and you avoid diluting everyone else. Just be sure to convert the departing founder’s common shares to preferred shares as part of the round, so the investor’s rights are aligned. These days, VCs expect a small secondary (often up to 10% of the round) for founder liquidity. Frame this as an alignment initiative , not a cleanup . While secondaries are most common in priced rounds, they also occur outside of that context—for example, as part of strategic cleanup before a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) or convertible note round, or during a management transition. Handled properly, a secondary can defuse future cap table concerns and help a new investor step in with confidence. The key issue for a secondary is at what price the departing founder’s common shares should be bought. Generally, companies prepare 409A valuations once a year. A starting point is to “discount” the founder’s common shares by the discount reflected in the 409A valuation. The reality is usually some back-and-forth before the secondary buyer and the departing founder agree on a price per share. B. Company Buyback or Share Transfer:  Sometimes the company buys back the shares, or the remaining founders step in to purchase them. It sounds simple—but it can get messy, fast. Between valuation issues, tax exposure, and corporate law constraints, buybacks and share transfers often carry more complexity than founders anticipate. C. Option Pool Expansion:  Instead of moving shares around, expand the option pool. Grant more options to the remaining team and new hires. Negotiate with investors to calculate their ownership after the pool expansion-don’t fall for the ‘pre-pool’ trap. This keeps incentives aligned without complicated transfers. It’s often the cleanest fix when the founder won’t sell, or when there’s no cash to support a buyback. Investors usually accept it, provided it’s paired with a clear hiring or retention plan that justifies the increased pool. D. Deferred Shares or Recapitalization:  In some cases, converting the departing founder’s shares into deferred shares or even recapitalizing the company can reset the cap table. This is more drastic and usually only makes sense if the cap table is truly broken. These moves usually require amending the charter and getting full board and stockholder approval—so alignment and leverage really matter. One approach is to convert the founder’s shares to a new class with no voting or economic rights, but a potential earnout if certain milestones are met. Every cap table fix comes with tax and legal consequences, some of them easy to overlook. Before finalizing any changes, make sure you’ve covered the basics: If the departing founder isn’t ready to sell, create a roadmap for a future secondary. Revisit the conversation once you’ve hit a major milestone, like a Series B or a late Series A extension. With more traction and a higher valuation, people tend to get more flexible. In the meantime, consider negotiating a call option or a right of first refusal (ROFR) that allows the company or its investors to repurchase the shares under predefined terms. You can build these rights into the Stockholders’ Agreement or a Side Letter—giving the company a clean option later without forcing a decision too soon. Losing a founder is hard—but it doesn’t have to throw the whole company off track. When handled thoughtfully, a transition can strengthen the business and set it up for long-term success. Here’s what helps founders get through it cleanly and come out stronger: At PAG Law, we’ve seen every version of the “band breakup.” We help founders rebalance their cap tables, keep investors engaged, and avoid the legal and tax traps that can derail a great company. If you’re facing a cap table headache, let’s talk. The band may change, but the show must go on. Don’t let dead equity stop you from playing your next gig/next round.

https://latamlist.com/8-uruguayan-startups-to-watch-in-2025/,8 Uruguayan Startups to Watch in 2025,2025-03-10T19:49:34+00:00,"These 8 startups are the most funded in Uruguay, leading the country’s tech boom. Learn about how they’re shaping Latin America’s tech scene.","Uruguay is one of Latin America’s smallest countries—with just 3.4M people, it is far smaller than cities like São Paulo ( 22.6M ), Mexico City ( 22.3M ), and Buenos Aires ( 15.49M ). But that hasn’t stopped Uruguay from punching above its weight on the international stage, and its national soccer team is proof: Uruguay has won 15 Copa Americas , second only to Argentina, along with two World Cups and two Olympic gold medals . Beyond sports, Uruguay has the highest GDP per capita in Latin America at $22.5K , standing out as an economic leader. Over the years, Uruguay has positioned itself as a hub for local startups and foreign investment through public policies like: But when did Uruguay become a technology powerhouse, and how did it become one of Latin America’s success cases? If you heard about Uruguay’s first unicorn in 2016, you’d never guess that it was an overnight success three decades in the making. Long before startups became popular in Latin America, three Uruguayan founders launched Scanntech in 1992 to help retail companies improve operations through technology–yes, before  MercadoLibre . Today, Scanntech provides software solutions to 450 of the world’s top 500 retailers, offering tools like ScannMarket for market and competitor analysis, ScannView for pricing optimization and product mix insights, and PromoClub for managing promotions at the point of sale. Nearly two decades later, PedidosYa launched in 2009 as a food delivery app and B2B last-mile logistics platform, helping restaurants and e-commerce businesses cut delivery costs and simplify operations. PedidosYa is now present in 15 Latin American countries and was acquired by Delivery Hero in 2014. In 2016, dLocal launched as a cross-border payment processor, connecting global merchants with emerging markets, becoming a unicorn in 2020 and IPO’ing on the NASDAQ in 2021—only the second Uruguayan company to reach Wall Street after StarMedia in 1999. Beyond its success in payments, dLocal has quietly become a launchpad for Latin American entrepreneurs. Joaquin Colella and Ilan Bajarlia , former software developer and head of sales at dLocal, now lead Nocnoc. Ex-dLocal executives Michel Golffed and Rodrigo Sánchez Prandi are driving fintech innovation at Brinta. Meanwhile, dLocal co-founder Sergio Fogel has turned his focus to Datanomik. All three of these companies–Scanntech, PedidosYa, and dLocal–have one thing in common: they’re headquartered in Montevideo, the beating heart of Uruguay’s tech scene and home to around 500 startups as of 2024. The Uruguayan capital is one of the most prominent emerging tech hubs in Latin America, with more VC-backed startups than cities like Monterrey, Medellin, Curitiba and Belo Horizonte. Now that you know why you should keep an eye out, let’s get into the 8 Uruguayan companies that, according to public data, have raised over $5M in venture capital funding and remain independent—meaning they haven’t been acquired, reached unicorn status, or gone public yet.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/a-domestic-bpo-sees-plenty-of-reasons-to-be-positive/,A Domestic BPO Sees Plenty of Reasons to Be Positive - Nearshore Americas,2025-05-15T19:09:16+00:00,"When U.S. President Donald Trump captured the White House in 2016, his economic agenda was made crystal clear: Bring more jobs back to America. Plenty of onshore BPO executives are still waiting to see this become a reality. Trump's ""America First"" platform has had its share of wins over the years, but most of those","When U.S. President Donald Trump captured the White House in 2016, his economic agenda was made crystal clear: Bring more jobs back to America. Plenty of onshore BPO executives are still waiting to see this become a reality. Trump’s “America First” platform has had its share of wins over the years, but most of those victories have centered around the manufacturing industry, and contact centers are still looking for a life raft. Estimates suggest about 300,000 U.S. jobs are “lost” to offshoring annually , according to data from Radix. A 2017 executive order, entitled the America First Tax Relief Plan , signed by Trump during his first term, sought to subject “profits that have accumulated offshore to a one-time low tax rate, thereby ending the tax incentive to keep those profits offshore.” The plan could have been the much-needed support domestic BPOs were looking for, but, Thomas Laird, CEO of Erie, Pennsylvania-based Expivia , a 600-seat contact center, said the idea never fully came to fruition. To be honest, I’m just a little disappointed,” he said. “You know, I would love to see some of (those jobs) come back onshore with the understanding that it would not just boost onshore, but also boost how quickly AI gets implemented. … It would be a win-win from that standpoint.” Cultural advantage still sells Despite the lack of policy wins at the federal level, Laird still feels domestic BPOs will remain viable for years to come — first and foremost due to the cultural advantage they provide for customers that, by and large, want to speak to fellow countrymen for customer support. “We’re proud of being a USA contact center,” he said. “I think the quality aspects — and I don’t really shy away from this — are much better. … We’ve seen study after study, and we’ve done our own studies, where it’s 70 to 80% of USA customers prefer to talk to somebody from the States.” While AI will continue to be a disruptor in the market, Laird said he still expects advertising campaigns to be launched in the future promoting human-based service over robotic support, similar to how many U.S. banks are increasingly branding as human-first in a digital world. “We just assume that every organization is going to go with AI. I think for certain things — 911 call centers, health care — there’s still going to be an appetite for the human being,” he said. The price is right As jobs continue to move offshore and Latin America continues to increase in popularity for U.S. clients looking to save money, Laird said BPO employee pay is beginning to consolidate in some forms across the globe. He specifically mentioned a dramatic rise in hiring costs in the United States’ nearshore market. “We’re never going to compete with offshore prices,” he said. “But we can relatively compete with nearshore prices as those have really skyrocketed, relatively speaking to where they’ve been, based on the technology that we can provide now.” Laird said agents at his Pennsylvania-based company are paid about $15 to $17 an hour, while supervisors are being paid $20-plus. He said contact centers tend to find success in the U.S. in areas that have low minimum wage, such as Pennsylvania’s $7.25 an hour limit, and areas that are not heavily taxed. This, typically, leads him to view medium-sized cities in rural areas — such as the Rust Belt that Expivia operates in — as being prime markets due to the size of the labor pool and lack of financial disincentives. Laird said the jobs are desirable because they are remote work and offer wages similar to what retail operations would demand in similar markets. Looking ahead, Laird said he believes AI adoption will likely lead to contact center agents being paid some of the “highest wages in the company,” to handle some of the most complex issues for customers that AI cannot handle independently. But he warned that, by and large, the industry does not have the necessary infrastructure built yet for full-scale AI adoption and feels many executives have jumped the gun and made unsuccessful attempts at using the technology to implement cost-cutting measures too soon. He expects many of those concerns to be waning by 2027, provided companies are taking a serious approach to building knowledge bases right now. Laird also noted the added security concerns that AI adoption will pose in the BPO world, including concerns surrounding data use in large language models. “There’s still a lot of things that need to be worked out with security,” he said.

https://latamlist.com/the-new-wave-of-startup-scams-what-founders-need-to-watch-out-for/,The New Wave of Startup Scams: What Founders Need to Watch Out For,2025-04-21T22:38:37+00:00,Check out a quick breakdown of the newer — and increasingly creative — scams founders need to watch for.,"The harsh fundraising climate in Latin America is creating a perfect storm. Founders are under pressure. Venture cycles are slower. There’s more noise, less signal. And where there’s uncertainty, bad actors thrive. Here’s a quick breakdown of the newer — and increasingly creative — scams founders need to watch for. The promise is tempting: “You’ve been selected to pitch in front of top-tier VCs at our exclusive demo day.” But before you get there, there’s always a catch — a “small application fee,” a “presentation coaching fee,” or worse, a required “sponsorship” payment to secure your spot. These operations often have slick branding and recognizable VC logos (often used without permission) on their landing pages. Some even fabricate testimonials from founders who supposedly raised money at previous events. What to watch for: Not all convertible notes are created equal. We’ve seen a rise in what we call “Predatory Convertible Notes.” These are investment offers that look legit — often backed by real contracts and lawyers — but include toxic terms that can cripple your startup later on. Common red flags: These terms often come from so-called family offices or international angel groups that are hard to diligence. In this version, a supposed VC associate reaches out saying they’re doing “preliminary diligence” on behalf of a partner. They ask for your pitch deck, cap table, even financials, projections, and customer lists — claiming it’s a precondition to a real meeting. Once you send the info? Silence. We suspect some of these fake profiles are harvesting data for other purposes — whether to resell lists or benchmark your idea for competitive reasons. How to stay safe: This one’s especially insidious. Founders are told they’ve been awarded a non-dilutive grant or prize. Sounds great, until you read the fine print: you need to wire a “processing fee” or pay local taxes upfront to release the funds. To make things worse, these scammers often send official-looking “letters of award” complete with seals, legal jargon, and even fake lawyer names to co-sign. Remember: Real grants don’t charge winners. They deduct fees from disbursements, if at all. And they always allow for tax compliance post-funding. A new twist we’ve seen: corporates or “strategic partners” offer to invest or license your product, but push aggressively to review your code base, algorithms, or confidential tech before anything’s signed. In some cases, the startup gets ghosted after handing over sensitive data. In others, they discover a similar product launched months later. In this climate, staying skeptical isn’t paranoia — it’s strategy. The golden rule still applies: If someone wants you to wire money before they wire money, it’s probably a scam. But even beyond that, founders need to: At PAG Law, we built Grow to help founders avoid exactly these types of traps. Grow gives startups access to vetted investor databases, secure deal tools, and US venture legal support — all designed with Latin founders in mind. Platforms don’t close rounds. But they can help founders spot the real players — and steer clear of the frauds. Scammers are getting smarter. But so are founders. If something feels off, it probably is. Slow down. Ask questions. Trust your gut. And when in doubt, don’t go it alone. Reach out to people who’ve been in the trenches. You’d be surprised how often one WhatsApp message can save your startup from a very expensive mistake.

https://latamlist.com/raising-money-in-the-u-s-heres-what-founders-need-to-know-about-securities-laws/,Raising Money in the U.S.? Here’s What Founders  Need to Know About Securities Laws,2025-05-05T15:00:00+00:00,"If you’re a startup raising money from U.S. investors, you should understand the basics of U.S. laws that will apply to your raise.","If you’re a startup raising money from U.S. investors, whether through a SAFE, convertible note, or even token sales, you should understand the basics of U.S. laws that will apply to your raise. Here’s the short version: almost everything you sell or “issue” to investors is considered a “security” under U.S. law. And unless you register the offering with the SEC (which is basically an IPO-level headache), you must qualify for an exemption. Otherwise, you are in violation of the law, subject to a range of penalties we’ll discuss below. Founders love moving fast. But raising money without following securities rules can get you sued and scared off future investors. If you issue securities without registration or an applicable exemption, investors can demand their money back (plus interest). The SEC can fine you or ban you from raising again. And even if regulators don’t show up, sloppy compliance can kill your next round or acquisition. Lawyers for VCs and acquirers will ask tough questions—and if your answers are not airtight, your deal might not close. The U.S. has two layers of securities regulation: federal (the SEC) and state (“blue sky” laws). Most federal exemptions override state registration, but you may still need to do notice filings and pay fees in every state where your investors reside. Regulation D is the lifeblood of U.S. startup fundraising and is what makes most venture rounds legal. All Reg D offerings require a Form D filing with the SEC within 15 days of the first sale in the round. There are two main Reg D flavors: This is what most VC-backed startups use. Want to promote your round publicly? This is your exemption. But: every investor must be accredited, and you need to verify it (not just take their word for it). However, per recent SEC guidance released in March 2025: If someone invests $200K+ (or $1M+ if they’re an entity), and represents that they are not using debt to invest, this satisfies the obligation to verify investor accreditation —no third-party checks needed. Rule 504 lets you raise up to $10 million, but it doesn’t override state laws. That means more filings, more complexity, and often no real benefit over 506(b). For this reason, Rule 504 is rarely used, and we almost never recommend this route for startups. Reg CF: Online Capital from a Broad Investor Base Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) is how you legally raise from the general public—customers, fans, your mom. Pro tip: Some founders pair a Reg CF with a traditional VC round to offer a slice to fans or customers without messing up their cap table. This is especially common among consumer-facing brands that want to include their community in their raise. Reg A+ sits between private rounds and a full-blown IPO. This is the old-school exemption, used before Reg D existed. It’s vague and risky if you don’t know what you’re doing. Unlike Reg D, no federal preemption applies, so companies may need to register with state securities regulators, in addition to the notice filings done in connection with Reg D rounds. Companies should use this only in very narrow cases, like insider rounds or founder equity grants. Otherwise, stick with Reg D. If your investors are based outside the U.S., Reg S is your friend. Fundraising is hard enough. Don’t add legal landmines to the mix. Whether you’re closing a friends-and-family round, pitching U.S. VCs, or launching a Reg CF campaign, getting the legal setup right now will save you a world of pain later. You only get one chance to make a good impression with investors. Make sure your raise is as professional as your pitch deck.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/declining-us-dollar-could-trigger-far-reaching-disruption/,Declining US Dollar Could Trigger Far-Reaching Disruption - Nearshore Americas,2025-03-25T13:53:34+00:00,"The declining US dollar looks set to pose new challenges to service exporters across Latin America. From tourism to BPOs, all are feeling the pinch.","As the US dollar weakens, Nearshore service providers are feeling the squeeze. With regional currencies rising against the greenback, many of them face the prospect of lower income or significant losses on contracts they signed with their American clients. “Yes, we have also been getting more pushback on pricing lately,” acknowledged Jeremy Stryer, co-founder of Holadev, a Queretaro, Mexico-based software development firm, most of whose clients are startups in the United States. “The constant exchange rate swings make it tough to predict pricing and revenue,” Stryer added. Mexico stands on shaky financial ground, more than any other country in the region. With exports accounting for 40% of its GDP—80% bound for the U.S. — a weakening dollar threatens to derail its dream of becoming the “China next door” for global manufacturing. After rising to new highs immediately after the election of President Donald Trump, the U.S. Dollar Index began to slide earlier this month. Already, the greenback has dropped nearly 5% from its 2025 highs. Analysts expect it to decline further in the coming months. Surprisingly, Latin American currencies had begun to strengthen even before the Dollar Index started sputtering. Argentina’s peso has surged by 40% in recent months, transforming the South American country from the cheapest destination in dollar terms to the most expensive in the region. Today, for many Argentines, living abroad now costs less than staying at home. The Mexican peso has appreciated nearly 5% against the greenback this year. Remarkably, the peso is rising even as the US imposes 25% tariffs on imports. The Brazilian real, meanwhile, has inched up by just 1.5% against the US dollar, largely influenced by high interest rates. One of the world’s top-performing currencies this year is the Colombian peso , which has surged 7.36%. The Peruvian sol has also made gains, appreciating 2.12% against the dollar, securing its place as the sixth-best-performing currency in the region. “It has been pretty crazy with respect to local currency fluctuations versus the U.S. dollar,” says Casey Halloran , CEO & Co-Founder of Costa Rican Vacations . “We are all grappling with this new reality and attempting to plan for continued shockwaves,” Halloran added. The declining US dollar “has indeed sparked concern among businesses relying on nearshoring models,” said Christian Corcino , founder and chairman at Intellisys D Corp , a nearshore IT services provider based in the Dominican Republic. But Corcino’s firm has yet to feel its ill effects. That’s largely because, as Corcino explains, the Dominican Republic’s peso has historically been closely tied to the dollar. “As the dollar’s value decreases, the Dominican peso tends to mirror that movement, so the impact on operational costs and competitiveness remains relatively neutral. Consequently, our own business, which employs personnel exclusively in the Dominican Republic, has seen minimal effect from the dollar’s recent decline.” Weak Dollar and Wage Growth Corcino noted that rising minimum wages, coupled with the decline in the USD, might prompt companies to adjust pricing or optimize resources to maintain profitability. He added that an increase in overall operational expenses for IT and BPO providers is a natural consequence of these economic shifts. In January, Costa Rica raised wages by 2.37%. Mexico implemented a 12% increase in its general minimum wage this year, while Brazil hiked it by 3.23%. Colombia’s minimum wage has nearly doubled in less than a decade. In February, Argentina enacted a 20% wage hike to help workers cope with soaring inflation. The Dominican Republic followed suit, making history with its own 20% wage increase. However, the increase in minimum wages is less likely to have a significant impact on IT workers. “For our organization, however, this shift has been less significant. Our employees — primarily software developers — already earn salaries well above the minimum wage, meaning the direct impact on payroll expenses is limited,” Corcino added. “Going forward, service providers across the region can navigate higher labor costs by focusing on specialized skill sets, improving efficiency, and delivering higher-value services, ensuring that any wage increases are balanced by productivity gains and a stronger competitive edge.” Impact on Tourism The impact of the weakened dollar could become evident in the quarterly fiscal reports of nearshore vendors later in April. However, its effects are already apparent in the tourism sector. Costa Rica’s tourism industry has suffered five consecutive months of declining foreign visitors, as the local currency, the colon, surged to historic highs. Before the pandemic, a three-day package cost around US$180 per person . Now, the same package exceeds $400—more than double the previous price. “The Colon vs. USD exchange rate has been detrimental to tourism since late 2022, when the USD to Colon rate fell from a peak of 670 to 500 (-25%),” Halloran added. By March 15, the colon had reached an all-time high of 485 per USD, as the international airports across the country showed a deep dip in foreign arrivals. “It has remained at that 500 level today, and multiple industries — agriculture, nearshoring, tourism, real estate, medical tourism, shipping — are highly concerned that a further decline in the USD’s value could lead to a loss of competitiveness,” Halloran said. Argentina Becomes Ever More Expensive President Javier Milei devalued Argentina’s currency by 54% shortly after taking office. A year later, it rebounded as the so-called “superpeso.” Meanwhile, the minimum wage jumped from 156,000 pesos at the start of 2024 to 272,000 pesos today — a 76% increase in nominal terms. In dollar value, it rose from $157 to $228. According to a report from online job platform Bumeran , the average salary sought in Argentina now stands at $1,234, surpassing the regional average. Just a year ago, it ranked among the lowest in Latin America. The stronger peso has reshaped tourism patterns. Fewer foreign tourists are visiting Argentina, while more Argentines are opting for trips abroad. In 2024, foreign tourist arrivals dropped by 8.4% to 6.2 million visitors, while the number of Argentine travelers heading overseas surged by 11.8%, reaching 8.3 million, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INDEC).

https://nearshoreamericas.com/caribbean-education-a-colonial-era-system-is-not-cutting-it/,Caribbean Education: A Colonial-Era System is Not Cutting It - Nearshore Americas,2025-03-27T17:48:46+00:00,"The Caribbean’s education system is in crisis, with recent studies showing most students struggle with mathematics, a fundamental skill in the modern world.","The Caribbean’s education system is in crisis, with recent studies showing a large majority of students struggling with mathematics, a fundamental skill in the modern world. “We are confronting a crisis … in education,” warned Lilia Burunciuc, the World Bank’s country director for the Caribbean, during a recent webinar. Unless urgent action is taken, Burunciuc said, the region’s economic future could be at risk. In the 2024 Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate exams, only 4.9% of students passed five or more subjects, including Mathematics and English . Even more concerning, just 36% passed Mathematics. But intelligence is not the problem. Caribbean students are just as capable as their global counterparts. The real issues, according to Victoria Levin, a senior economist in the World Bank’s education global practice, are outdated teaching methods and deep-rooted inequalities in educational access. Colonial Legacy Still Shapes Education The education system, shaped by colonial-era practices, still favors the privileged. Under colonial rule, elite schools were reserved for wealthy students. Today, private schools continue the tradition through selective entrance exams, a “sorting mechanism” as Levin describes it. In Trinidad and Tobago, for example, the Secondary Entrance Assessment (SEA) is a high-stakes exam for 11- to 13-year-olds seeking entry into public secondary schools. It is essentially a modern version of the British-era College Exhibition Examination, originally designed to limit access to education. SEA heavily tests students in Mathematics and Creative Writing, and only top scorers secure places in the best schools. And this isn’t unique to Trinidad — Barbados, Jamaica, and other Caribbean nations follow similar models. Even after rigorous selection, less than 80% of students pass English, and fewer than half succeed in Mathematics, Levin added. Higher Education Thrives, Yet Early Education Suffers Surprisingly, the Caribbean spends more on college education than on primary schooling. “Higher education, especially through the University of the West Indies system, has made considerable improvements over the past decade,” said Scott MacDonald, a fellow at the Caribbean Policy Consortium , in a conversation with Nearshore Americas. From his experience, graduates from these institutions are competent and well-prepared. However, many struggle due to weak foundational education. For the region to advance, MacDonald insists, reform is essential. “Competition is global,” he warns. Without fixing the education system, the Caribbean risks falling further behind. MacDonald, an expert in Caribbean economic issues, has taught political science in several institutions and authored books on the region’s development challenges. Teachers Are Leaving in Large Numbers For decades, the Caribbean has been losing teachers to better-paying countries . Jamaica alone lost 10% of its teacher workforce in just three years. In 2022, 1,538 teachers left in just nine months. Some aren’t just leaving the country — they’re leaving the profession altogether. “Some (teachers) are not migrating but leaving the profession (altogether) because they are overworked, underpaid, and undervalued,” said Dr. Garth Anderson, head of the Caribbean Teachers’ Union, at a 2023 conference in Barbados . Even newly qualified teachers in the UK, Canada, and the U.S. earn two to three times more than those in Jamaica, St. Lucia, Suriname and Trinidad, according to a University of the West Indies study. Beyond low wages, many Caribbean nations lack clear teacher recruitment and training standards. A World Bank and OECS study found that in many countries, teachers don’t receive full training until nearly a decade into their careers. The entry requirements are shockingly low. In Grenada, for example, a person can become a teacher with just five subject passes. Until 2019, new teachers received only a two-week induction program—their only formal preparation before taking charge of a classroom. Guyana’s Smart Classrooms: A Model for Change While most of the Caribbean struggles with outdated education systems, one country is taking a bold step forward. Guyana, fueled by its booming oil wealth, is embracing the future. In 2021, with support from the World Bank, Guyana introduced smart classrooms — equipping schools with smartboards, projectors, and laptops. The impact has been remarkable. At Kuru Kururu Primary School, 38 kilometers south of Georgetown, attendance has improved dramatically. “The difference is clear — students are more engaged than ever,” the head teacher told the World Bank. Teachers, too, are benefiting. With digital tools, they can refine their teaching methods and continuously improve. Before, lessons relied on static charts and worksheets. Thanks to the interactive way of learning, studying maths has become a joyful experience for students. Encouraged by this success, Guyana announced a $676 million investment in late 2024 to expand smart classrooms nationwide.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/h1b-visa-restirctions-could-boost-nearshoring/,H1-B Visa Restrictions Likely to Boost Nearshore - Nearshore Americas,2025-04-03T16:00:23+00:00,"Tech giants, including Microsoft, Google and Amazon, warned H1-B Visa employees this week against leaving the country for fear of not being allowed back in, the latest twist in an ongoing conversation surrounding immigration in America. As anxiety rises among U.S. visa holders amid rising deportations and scrutiny, some Nearshore industry experts are saying the","Tech giants, including Microsoft, Google and Amazon, warned H1-B Visa employees this week against leaving the country for fear of not being allowed back in, the latest twist in an ongoing conversation surrounding immigration in America. As anxiety rises among U.S. visa holders amid rising deportations and scrutiny, some Nearshore industry experts are saying the dynamic could be beneficial to companies aligned with talent acquisition in Latin America. The H1-B Visa program brings more than 100,000 highly educated foreigners to the U.S. each year for jobs that pay at least $60,000 per year. Typically, about 500,000 to 600,000 H1-B Visa holders are on American soil at any one time, about 70% of which are Indian nationals. This week, Indian H1-B workers voiced concerns to The Washington Post about the changes in immigration policy, with one noting the recent revocation of birthright citizenship, meaning the U.S.-born children of visa holders are at risk of becoming stateless upon birth. The Trump administration has not been consistent with its messaging on H1-B Visas, which was most recently highlighted during a public disagreement between a cohort of Trump supporters and Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy in December. Musk and Ramaswamy advocated against restricting H1-B Visas as had been done during Trump’s first term . Trump ultimately decided to keep his hands off the H1-B program while signing a slew of executive orders in January that, in part, ordered “enhanced vetting” for visa applicants and those already in the country. With deportations skyrocketing and continued anti-immigration rhetoric emitting from the White House, experts are warning about the potential business implications that could arise from the increased scrutiny placed on immigration. Call to Elevate Service Amid the ever-changing rhetoric and heightened anxiety among visa holders, the situation may provide an opportunity for companies aligned with the nearshoring industry. “It’s an interesting moment for our market,” said Pablo Baldomá Jones, co-founder and chief executive officer of Alto , a global software engineering firm. “I would describe it as a cocktail of increasing talent predisposition toward remote work combined with this reduction in these visas.” Jones’ business focuses on connecting talent from Latin America to the U.S. He said if visa intake is reduced, salaries in America will likely rise, which will cause more opportunity and competition in the nearshore market. “It’s worth noting that nearshore companies present an alternative to H1-B talent, though this pushes providers to elevate their service standards to remain competitive. We’ve particularly noticed that some companies become more hesitant to work with nearshore providers when compliance requirements are stricter, such as in banking. And this drives all LatAm providers to raise the bar regarding security standards.” Heading for Brighter Pastures Pablo Miller, chief executive officer of Remoti , a platform specializing in remote talent solutions in Latin America, echoed Jones’ comments on immigration restrictions bringing opportunity to the nearshore industry, and also said it could cause a new influx of talent relocating to Latin American countries. A dual citizen of Britain and Colombia, Miller said there is a growing trend of Indian tech workers, who traditionally head for Silicon Valley, relocating to Colombia due to new restrictions and concerns. “When I lived in Colombia years ago, I didn’t see many Indians around, but now when you go there, just walking around the shopping center, it’s noticeable that these tech workers are relocating. There’s a growing number of Indian expats.” Miller is looking to the upcoming 2026 presidential election in Colombia as a key decider in how the country manages to take advantage of its business opportunities in the future. Incumbent Gustavo Petro is term-limited, and Miller said whichever candidate shows the most interest in bringing foreign dollars into the country is likely to win the election. “Who doesn’t want foreign dollars coming into Colombia? Who doesn’t want more jobs in Colombia? But, most importantly, who doesn’t want Silicon Valley knowledge coming into Colombia?” he said. “These companies may not necessarily be building in Colombia, but they’re going to be made in Colombia.” Riding the Wave of Momentum Jens Gould, Founder and CEO of Amalga Group , said he has seen some anecdotal evidence of overseas talent moving to Latin America, but hasn’t witnessed first-hand any major shift in the nationality of workers in the nearshoring industry. Nevertheless, if more quantifiable immigration restrictions were to occur, he also believes it could boost both the nearshore industry and Latin American countries overall. “In terms of any (potential) immigration policy in the U.S., if they restrict in any way, I actually think that could lead to more interest in services for nearshore companies. … If it’s harder to bring the world’s best talent to the U.S., the companies are still going to need that talent. They’re going to look elsewhere for it, and given the nearshore value proposition that we all know of — the time zone, the cultural affinity, the proximity — it’s the most logical place.” Gould said recent market factors have given a boost to nearshoring, including a drop in near-term interest rates that has spurred investment in the region. The Mexican government, which has focused heavily on supporting the manufacturing industry, and other regional governments could do more to support the potential for a nearshoring boom, he feels. “You see some activity, some investment, in education, particularly tech and engineering, some movement on tax incentives, development of tech hubs, but it’s not nearly enough. Mexico could do a lot more to incentivize this … there’s been a real increase in interest in Mexico’s tech talent, and you haven’t seen the government jump in and do that much.” Comment Name *  Email *  Website   Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.    Tim—spot on analysis. What’s happening around H1-B policy isn’t a side issue—it’s accelerating a deeper reconfiguration of how U.S. companies access global talent. And yes, Latin America is the next frontier—but we must be honest about the readiness gap. Most current SaaS platforms, even the newer EOR apps, don’t go far enough. They weren’t built to operate as full-stack, self-learning systems. The market now demands automation that connects sourcing, vetting, onboarding, compliance, and ongoing performance in one integrated loop. Anything less is just duct tape. The stakes are rising fast—literally. Salaries for engineers in LATAM are climbing, and vendors running outdated delivery models are struggling to hold onto clients. Why? Their rates are ballooning, but their value delivery hasn’t evolved. What we need now is an industry reset. Vendors need to run lean, with high-efficiency operations, less internal bloat, and transparent flat rates that give accounts room to grow without blowing up the client’s long-term budget. We laid this out in our research years ago, which unexpectedly became the first formal science papers focused on Nearshore IT Staff Augmentation. The takeaway is even more urgent now: the future belongs to platforms that can deliver velocity, accuracy, and transparency by design—not as a patch. —Lonnie McRorey When U.S. President Donald Trump captured the White House in 2016, his economic agenda was made crystal clear: Bring more jobs back to America.

https://latamlist.com/rebalancing-the-cap-table-when-a-founder-leaves-the-band/,Rebalancing the Cap Table When a Founder Leaves the Band,2025-05-12T15:00:00+00:00,Don't miss Juan Pablo Capello's and Julian Constain article on how to rebalance the cap table when a founder leaves,"Starting a company with co-founders is a lot like forming a band. You choose your co-founders because you all share a vision, you’re excited to build something together, and you hope the team sticks around for the world tour. But inevitably, reality sets in. Just like rock bands, founding teams often change. Someone steps back, priorities shift, and suddenly you’re facing a common but tricky issue: “dead equity”, shares held by a founder who’s no longer in actively working in the business, no longer helping drive the company forward. This happens more often than founders expect, and it’s rarely simple to fix. Many founders are blindsided by the legal and financial implications, and even sophisticated investors can grow uneasy if it’s not addressed early and efficiently. Rebalancing the cap table when a founder leaves requires careful planning, open communication, and a solid understanding of the tools available. Here’s how to keep your cap table healthy, your investors happy, and your company on track when the lineup changes. Dead equity means a significant chunk of your company is owned by someone who’s no longer contributing/working in the business. Venture capitalists rightly see this dead equity as a problem, founders who are still building the company resent the dead equity, and when dead equity shows up in your cap table, that dead equity can tank your fundraising efforts. Generally, VCs take issue when 10% or more of the company is dead capital—especially when that’s more than what an active founder owns. Startups are built on trust. When a founder steps away, start with an honest conversation about the impact on the cap table. Don’t avoid this conversation. If you’re lucky, your departing founder will understand why rebalancing the equity is necessary. If not, you’ll need to explain that without a fix, future funding/the future of the company is at risk. If the founder who’s leaving isn’t open to rebalancing the equity—code for giving up some of that dead equity voluntarily , then the company may need to think how to recapitalize the cap table. There’s no one-size-fits-all solution to ‘fix’ the cap table of dead equity, but here are the most practical approaches: A. Secondary Sale to Investors:  Have your lead VC or new investor buy shares directly from the departing founder. This approach is clean and straightforward. The VC gets to their target ownership (usually, around 10%), the departing founder gets some liquidity, and you avoid diluting everyone else. Just be sure to convert the departing founder’s common shares to preferred shares as part of the round, so the investor’s rights are aligned. These days, VCs expect a small secondary (often up to 10% of the round) for founder liquidity. Frame this as an alignment initiative , not a cleanup . While secondaries are most common in priced rounds, they also occur outside of that context—for example, as part of strategic cleanup before a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) or convertible note round, or during a management transition. Handled properly, a secondary can defuse future cap table concerns and help a new investor step in with confidence. The key issue for a secondary is at what price the departing founder’s common shares should be bought. Generally, companies prepare 409A valuations once a year. A starting point is to “discount” the founder’s common shares by the discount reflected in the 409A valuation. The reality is usually some back-and-forth before the secondary buyer and the departing founder agree on a price per share. B. Company Buyback or Share Transfer:  Sometimes the company buys back the shares, or the remaining founders step in to purchase them. It sounds simple—but it can get messy, fast. Between valuation issues, tax exposure, and corporate law constraints, buybacks and share transfers often carry more complexity than founders anticipate. C. Option Pool Expansion:  Instead of moving shares around, expand the option pool. Grant more options to the remaining team and new hires. Negotiate with investors to calculate their ownership after the pool expansion-don’t fall for the ‘pre-pool’ trap. This keeps incentives aligned without complicated transfers. It’s often the cleanest fix when the founder won’t sell, or when there’s no cash to support a buyback. Investors usually accept it, provided it’s paired with a clear hiring or retention plan that justifies the increased pool. D. Deferred Shares or Recapitalization:  In some cases, converting the departing founder’s shares into deferred shares or even recapitalizing the company can reset the cap table. This is more drastic and usually only makes sense if the cap table is truly broken. These moves usually require amending the charter and getting full board and stockholder approval—so alignment and leverage really matter. One approach is to convert the founder’s shares to a new class with no voting or economic rights, but a potential earnout if certain milestones are met. Every cap table fix comes with tax and legal consequences, some of them easy to overlook. Before finalizing any changes, make sure you’ve covered the basics: If the departing founder isn’t ready to sell, create a roadmap for a future secondary. Revisit the conversation once you’ve hit a major milestone, like a Series B or a late Series A extension. With more traction and a higher valuation, people tend to get more flexible. In the meantime, consider negotiating a call option or a right of first refusal (ROFR) that allows the company or its investors to repurchase the shares under predefined terms. You can build these rights into the Stockholders’ Agreement or a Side Letter—giving the company a clean option later without forcing a decision too soon. Losing a founder is hard—but it doesn’t have to throw the whole company off track. When handled thoughtfully, a transition can strengthen the business and set it up for long-term success.

One of the suspects, Tyrone Rose, along with an unidentified co-worker, exploited their privileged system access to manipulate a loophole in StubHub’s platform, according to a complaint filed with a criminal court in Queens, New York. The American ticket marketplace had a reseller contract with Sutherland, granting its employees access to specific backend functions. Rose and his accomplice capitalized on this access to resell nearly 1,000 tickets for high-profile events, including Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour , Adele and Ed Sheeran concerts, NBA games, and the U.S. Open Tennis Championships. StubHub generates a unique URL for each ticket purchase, allowing buyers to download their tickets. Rose and his co-worker infiltrated a restricted part of the system where ticket orders were stored. They then altered the email addresses linked to these orders, redirecting the ticket download links to their associates instead of the legitimate buyers. Between June 2022 and July 2023, they stole 993 tickets across 350 orders, with the majority coming from Swift’s Eras Tour, thanks to its record-breaking demand. When StubHub uncovered the fraud, it swiftly terminated its contract with Sutherland and alerted law enforcement. New York police have arrested Tyrone Rose and Shamara Simmons, while a third suspect remains on the run. A fourth accomplice died before facing charges. Rose and Simmons are now confronting serious charges, including grand larceny, computer tampering, and conspiracy, which could result in prison sentences ranging from 3 to 15 years. Could it be Avoided? The case has ignited major concerns about security oversight at Sutherland, leaving the global BPO firm scrambling to contain the fallout. Jared Koll, a CX advisor based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, believes Sutherland could have averted the incident had it implemented “AI-anomaly solutions.” These tools monitor agents’ behavior and flag high-risk actions, such as accessing unauthorized databases. “Further, geo-fencing and device security could have stopped these agents from accessing unauthorized systems in the first place, through permissions and device access controls.” After discovering the fraud, StubHub promptly issued a press release and announced the contract termination. However, Sutherland has remained silent, neither making a public statement nor responding to Nearshore Americas’ email inquiry. “We don’t know the internal steps SGS is taking, but if we were advising them, we’d expect a full post-mortem and an RFP process for upgraded security infrastructure,” Koll said when asked about potential next steps. “If you are a Jamaica-based BPO that is NOT SGS, you should launch a full messaging push, publicly highlighting the compliance improvements you’ve made since 2024.” Jamaica’s Reaction According to Radio Jamaica, Wayne Sinclair, president of the Global Services Association of Jamaica (GSAJ), said the incident has cast a long shadow over Jamaica’s BPO industry. This is partly because the accused are Jamaican nationals who likely exploited the trust Sutherland Global placed in them. Sinclair called for hefty penalties on employees who engage in such crimes. “Such (punishments) will act as a real deterrent to people who may be thinking about doing this because I think right now there’s a sense that it’s worth the risk.” However, the GSAJ President emphasized that all BPOs have enforced stringent security protocols to safeguard client data. He stressed that this breach occurred due to a betrayal of trust by employees. “Our BPOs have strong, independent relationships with clients, reinforced by frequent client visits to our locations and rigorous inspections of our physical and IT security protocols and processes.” “The confidence of our collective client base in our service is rooted in these trusted personal relationships.” News Editor for Nearshore Americas, Narayan Ammachchi is a career journalist with a decade of experience in politics and international business.

As the saturation of more established hubs in Mexico, Colombia and various Central American countries solidifies, Hermosillo’s providers plan to attract more businesses,","Hermosillo, the capital of the Mexican state of Sonora, increasingly attracts the interest of market participants looking to optimize operations and maintain competitive advantages in the Latin America and Caribbean BPO market. As the saturation of more established hubs in Mexico, Colombia and various Central American countries solidifies, Hermosillo’s providers plan to attract more businesses, according to government officials and industry leaders present during the “BPO Influencers and CX Leadership Summit” on March 14. The summit was organized by Alliance BPO Services , a Hermosillo-based BPO provider with global presence for multiple industries in North America, Latin America & Caribbean. Alliance BPO Services offers custom-tailored agreements, with performance commitments aligned to their client success, instead of standard service contracts. Local insights are crucial to understanding why Hermosillo is capturing interest and how it compares with established BPO hotspots in the region. Local Talent Pool and Workforce Dynamics Around a dozen international BPOs currently operate in Hermosillo, according to research from the firm Ryan Strategic Advisory . The city boasts a young, educated workforce, a significant advantage for BPO firms. Hermosillo has a population of around one million people. “The fresh talent coming out of our universities is not only tech-savvy but also adaptable. We see graduates translating their knowledge into real-world skills for service excellence,” said local entrepreneur and Alliance BPO Services CEO Juan Caire. Caire added that Hermosillo’s universities and technical schools are focusing on producing graduates well-versed in technology, administration, and languages, which is essential for catering to diverse client needs. This growing talent pool allows companies like Alliance BPO Services to meet specific customer demands effectively. “Our clients frequently note that our staff’s linguistic abilities and cultural familiarity with the US audience set us apart; it’s more than just outsourcing; it is about creating a seamless extension of their teams,” said Alliance BPO Services Co-founder Daniel Castilla. For Peter Ryan, President and Principal Analyst of Ryan Strategic Advisory, Alliance BPO Services is taking a pragmatic and practical approach to its development of AI tools. “By applying the technology in areas in which it can make a positive difference to the consumer, as opposed to pushing it into use cases where it may not be ready, Alliance BPO is likely to gain traction from its current and existing clients searching for a full service provider,” Ryan told Nearshore Americas. Adopting Technology and AI Hermosillo operators understand that they are pursuing market shares growth in highly competitive market macro conditions. Firms like Alliance BPO Services expect that an “all in” approach to technology will differentiate their unique value proposition. Alliance BPO Services is pioneering efforts to integrate artificial intelligence into their operations, not to substitute human agents, but to enhance their capabilities. “AI enables us to improve efficiency and quality of service. Clients are responding positively, reporting faster response times and improved satisfaction through AI-supported customer interactions. We are not trying to replace our employees but help them identify gaps and improve their performance,” Castilla said. Live translation technologies are becoming a staple. “With our ability to communicate in real time with customers across cultures, we can bridge language barriers that have historically impeded efficiency,” Caire said. This tech-savvy approach ensures that Hermosillo remains competitive, particularly in industries that require immediate and multilingual support. Strategic Location and Market Access Hermosillo’s geographical positioning near the U.S. border is another factor that enhances its appeal. Proximity allows companies to effectively manage cross-border operations with minimal cultural and time zone discrepancies. According to the CEO and Founder of SupportU Hui Curtis, “Hermosillo’s location enables firms to provide robust customer support services that resonate with US clients.” This geographical advantage is not just theoretical; local BPO firms report being able to align workflows with US business hours, reducing lag and enhancing service delivery. SupportU currently assists a client doing business out of Hermosillo. Ongoing investments in infrastructure, particularly in transportation and communication networks, will bolster this advantage. Challenges on the horizon The visibility of Hermosillo as a BPO destination outside of Mexico is limited. “We need to advocate more effectively for our capabilities and the talent we offer to attract international clients,” said Arturo Fernandez, President of Sonora Global. This raises the issue of effective marketing and branding for the city’s BPO services. “I see two main challenges — the first is gaining visibility, in a sea of nearshore options.  It will be important for the Hermosillo stakeholders in private and public domains to work together to make certain their community is part of the broader Mexican / nearshore discussion.  The second one is air connections — it will be essential for the business community to lobby for more flights into the city from the U.S. and other foreign ports.  Currently, for business travelers it can be cumbersome to visit,” Ryan added. Navigating regulatory challenges is another ongoing concern. Firms must ensure compliance with local, state, and federal regulations as they expand. Streamlined regulations could play a vital role in easing entry and operation for new BPO companies. “We are digitizing a large amount of the permitting process, aiming to have a complete digital process during the next two years,” Daniel Gastélum, director of the local economic development agency said during the summit. The Road Ahead The future of Hermosillo’s BPO sector hinges on how it addresses its challenges while continuing to capitalize on its strengths. The focus on technological integration, a strong local workforce and strategic market positioning offers potential for meaningful growth. As Caire stated: “Our commitment to improving and adapting is not just about survival; it is about thriving in a competitive landscape.” With a unified approach, Hermosillo could solidify its reputation as a viable, dynamic player in the global BPO arena.

Last week, the U.S. revoked his visa. The state department told NPR visa records are confidential and cannot be discussed publicly. Arias said workers at the U.S. embassy in Costa Rica informed him the action had been taken over his close ties to the Chinese government. Arias has been critical of U.S. President Donald Trump and earlier this year compared him to a “Roman emperor.” The Nobel Laureate believes those comments may have led to the decision to revoke his visa. A Shift in Policy Signalling to Arias that he is no longer welcome in the U.S. is the most high-profile example of a noticeable shift in policy from the Trump administration. Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a memo to diplomats asking them to search through the social media accounts of visa applicants. This follows an executive order signed by Trump that jump-started an effort to deport individuals from the country who have “hostile attitudes” toward American values. Trump has also inked an order to reduce antisemitism that has been used to justify the deportation of students protesting against Israel’s military actions in Gaza. On Thursday, Inside Higher Ed reported the state department has modified or revoked more than 600 student visas since the order was signed. Populism in LatAm The left wing in Latin America has historically opposed the influence exerted by the United States in the region. Arias’ goal for peace in 1986 was not helped by the U.S. funding of the right-wing Contra rebels that were causing instability in Nicaragua. After years of political dominance, the left capitulated when the Conservative Wave hit Latin America about 10 years ago, bringing an influx of right-wing leadership to numerous countries. But the branding, this time, was not quite the same as the conservative administrations of years past. Raquel Chanto, a Costa Rican political scientist and Oxford University Ph.D. candidate, cited a global decline in trust as being responsible for the rise of populist leaders in an interview with Yoriko Yasukawa, vice president of the Foundation for Global Governance and Sustainability. “Trust is the philosopher’s stone of political systems, something you can translate into results through legitimacy, buy-in and willingness to cooperate and engage in political agreements,” Chanto said. “Overall, people trust systems that they believe are fair, consistent, open and responsive; where they feel included and heard, and their needs are addressed. That is to say that citizens trust the good government.” Rhetoric vs. Reality Teamstation AI CEO and Co-Founder Lonnie McRorey has lived in Mexico for nine years while operating his nearshore staffing system company. “I think more professionals are trying to stay here — they’re not so eager to go to the U.S.,” he said. “But, look, the dollar still has a very powerful way. There are people here willing to risk everything in their lives to make $300.” McRorey said that the disparity among Mexican nationals creates an interesting dynamic, with the ability for many to have a quality of life at or surpassing what the U.S. offers while still seeing abject poverty and citizens trying to escape the country. “There’s high taxes, no access to health care,” he said of the U.S. “Believe it or not, quality of life in LatAm is better than in the U.S. in many ways.” Latin American reliance on economic support from the United States has waned in recent years as China begins to exert influence in the region. Arias, while Costa Rica’s president, established diplomatic relations with China in 2007. The BRICS economic bloc, originally a partnership between Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, announced in January it was adding nine “partner” nations, which included Bolivia. Additionally, BRICS says it has received interest from Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Uruguay and Venezuela to join the partnership. ‘Sympathy for the Devil’ The U.S. military is taking notice. A report released by the Army-operated Foreign Military Studies Office states that there is an increase in the number of Latin American countries looking to develop significant overseas relations . “This development signals that dictatorships in Latin America see the BRICS grouping as an economic and political lifeline amid difficult economic and diplomatic moments. Relatedly, the inclusion of a greater number of Latin American countries in BRICS will bring China and Russia further into the Western hemisphere, where both have been increasing their influence of late,” the report states. Similarly, a report issued by Irene Mia, a senior fellow for Latin America at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the U.S. should be wary of celebrating its near-term policy victories , such as tackling drug trafficking, before it fully realizes some of the long-term effects its rhetoric toward Latin America may bring. “Without concrete measures to support Latin America’s economic growth and diversification, and to bolster its Democratic institutions, China will remain a dominant economic force in the region,” Mia wrote. “Additionally, trade tariffs and deportations of undocumented migrants to their countries of origin — particularly through the economic blow of lost remittances — will wreak havoc on Latin American economies, making China’s trade and investment even more attractive.” Comment Name *  Email *  Website   Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/costa-ricas-living-costs-rising-despite-low-inflation/,Costa Rica’s Living Costs Rising Despite Low Inflation - Nearshore Americas,2025-04-16T19:41:03+00:00,"Living costs in Costa Rica are rising even as the inflation rate plunges and the local currency, the colón, continues to strengthen.","Living costs in Costa Rica are rising even as inflation plunges and the local currency, the colón, continues to strengthen — an unusual combination that has puzzled economists. The inflation rate fell to a new low of 1.21% in March, down slightly from 1.24% in February. At the same time, a new report from the central bank has reignited debate over whether Costa Rica is, in fact, an expensive country. Authored by economic researcher Melissa Vega, the report compares Costa Rica with Chile in terms of overall living costs. Vega concludes that while Costa Rica may be comparable to Chile, it is considerably more expensive than upper-middle-income countries like Colombia and Mexico. The report indicates that health and education are categories where Costa Rica has remained more expensive than similar countries in Latin America. Though the overall price levels appear to place Costa Rica on par with Chile, a more granular breakdown by product category reveals troubling disparities. The cost differences are especially pronounced in staple food items. Milk, cheese, and eggs in Costa Rica cost between 24% and 26% more than the OECD average and up to 28% more than the Latin American average. Prices for soft drinks and bottled water are 19% to 22% higher than in OECD countries and 29% higher than in Latin America. Even basic items like bread and cereals are 5% to 7% more expensive than in OECD countries and up to 25% more than in Latin America. The price gap widens further in categories such as fruits, vegetables, and potatoes, which are up to 9% costlier than in the OECD and as much as 41% more expensive than in the rest of Latin America. Businessmen are Worried Adolfo Cruz, President of CAMTIC , expressed disappointment at the rising prices. “We’ve lost competitiveness and have become a very expensive country.” The Costa Rican Chamber of Information and Communication Technologies (CAMTIC) is a key organization that represents and promotes the interests of the ICT sector in the country. The surging colón is apparently dealing a double-whammy impact on global services providers operating in the country. Since late 2022, the colón has risen around 30% , climbing from a low of 670 per U.S. dollar to around 500 today. Cruz is also skeptical of the inflation figures published monthly by the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC). He contends that the explanations offered by the agency fail to reflect the lived reality. “Costa Rica risks becoming a destination that only the affluent can afford,” warned Casey Halloran, CEO of Costa Rican Vacations , a travel agency based in the country’s capital, San José. “This isn’t just about currency; structural issues like high food prices, transport costs, and bureaucratic burdens drive prices up.” Employment Costs Halloran is also concerned about the ripple effects of high living costs on payroll expenses. Costa Rica adjusts its minimum wage almost annually, and while the country offers generous incentives to firms operating in its free trade zones, the cost of employment is steep. Employers must contribute approximately 26% of an employee’s salary to social security (including insurance and pensions) — more than double the OECD average of 12% . This translates into significantly higher labor costs for companies operating in Costa Rica. In addition, employers are required to pay a mandatory Christmas bonus, known locally as Aguinaldo — equivalent to one-twelfth of the employee’s total earnings over the previous 12 months — as well as paid vacation leave for those who have worked at least 50 consecutive weeks. Carlos Wong, president of the Free Trade Zones Association (AZOFRAS), highlighted these pressures in comments to local media outlet El Observador . He noted that the strengthening of the colón against the U.S. dollar has sharply increased operating costs. This, he warned, is restricting business expansion and delaying job-creating projects. Wong also referred to the OECD findings, emphasizing that a combination of high energy costs and burdensome operational expenses is weighing on business expansion.

At the China-CELAC Forum in Beijing, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , Colombian President Gustavo Petro, and Chilean President Gabriel Boric are set to engage in discussions to enhance regional cooperation. President Lula’s visit aims to expand Brazil’s exports of soybeans, meats, and minerals to China, capitalizing on opportunities arising from U.S.-China trade tensions . This visit marks his third meeting with President Xi Jinping since 2023, reflecting deepening bilateral ties. Meanwhile, Colombia’s President Petro announced the country’s accession to China’s Belt and Road Initiative, focusing on infrastructure development and technological advancement. This move underscores Colombia’s pursuit of diversified partnerships beyond traditional U.S. alliances. China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi emphasized Latin America’s right to self-determination, subtly critiquing U.S. policies reminiscent of the Monroe Doctrine. He highlighted China’s commitment to mutual respect and non-interference in the region’s affairs. Economic ties between Brazil and China have intensified, with bilateral trade reaching $157.62 billion in the first ten months of 2024. China remains Brazil’s largest trading partner , importing significant volumes of soybeans, iron ore, and oil. This strategic realignment indicates a broader trend of Latin American nations seeking diversified economic partnerships, balancing relations between major global powers.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/revelo-acquires-alto-as-demand-for-latam-ai-workers-rise/,Alto Merges into Revelo as Demand for AI Devs Accelerates - Nearshore Americas,2025-05-07T22:08:15+00:00,"U.S.-based AI hiring platform Revelo has acquired Alto, a regional competitor that helps American companies hire remote software developers from Latin America.","U.S.-based hiring platform Revelo has acquired Alto amid surging demand for professionals skilled in training large language models. Launched in 2015, Alto transitioned from a remote-first staffing company into a comprehensive tech talent platform. “The merger helps us to scale our mission,” said Juan Salas , co-founder and CTO at Alto. “We built Alto on the belief that Latin America could be a driving force in the AI revolution. I’m proud of what we created, and excited to see that vision continue through Revelo,” Salas said, confirming that both he and his co-founder, Pablo Baldomá Jones , would gain a role in Revelo. “Together, we’re building an end-to-end solution that removes the friction from hiring in Latin America,” Baldomá Jones said. When asked how many Latin American professionals they had placed with U.S. companies, Baldomá estimated “the figure could be somewhere between 800 and 1,000.” Alto’s client list includes 24 Hour Fitness, Anytime Fitness, and BBVA. During the interview, both co-founders acknowledged the sharp increase in demand for AI talent . “The demand for AI-literate developers — especially those who can contribute to complex post-training work on large language models — is accelerating.” The acquisition significantly expands Revelo’s presence in the region and marks its fifth deal in just 30 months, underscoring its rapid growth strategy. Revelo stated that, following the acquisition, the total number of professionals on its platform has reached 400,000. According to Revelo, companies are competing to secure talent capable of enhancing large language models for advanced tasks such as coding. Hiring related to large language model training accounted for 22% of Revelo’s revenue in 2024, according to Spanish news outlets, and analysts believe this share is likely to increase. This growth is driven by companies developing their own AI models and seeking specialized engineers and datasets to train them. They require human input to interact with machines and validate the generated code. “It is simply impossible to hire developers at scale without the help of platforms like Alto,” Salas said, with Baldomá Jones adding that hiring Latin American talent involves extensive backend processes such as identifying and vetting candidates. Salas dismissed the notion that automation in software development would diminish the demand for IT talent. Instead, he emphasized that companies are actually scaling up their operations and increasing their need for skilled professionals.

The $15.2 billion deal will make NTT Data a wholly owned subsidiary, giving NTT full control over its IT services arm. This move builds on a 2022 restructuring that placed NTT’s overseas operations under NTT Data, establishing it as the centerpiece of the group’s international IT solutions business. However, overlapping capital structures have hindered fast decision-making , especially around major data center investments driven by rising demand for generative AI. NTT President and CEO Akira Shimada cited governance challenges, including conflicts of interest from dual stock listings and a convoluted decision-making process, as key reasons for the acquisition. He emphasized that the new structure will allow better accountability and smoother allocation of management resources. NTT Data’s core services include IT solutions and data center operations for domestic and global clients. Its overseas presence is particularly strong in Latin America , where it supports public and private sector digital transformation in countries like Brazil, Argentina, and Chile, offering solutions in finance, healthcare, and smart cities.

Geopolitical friction is already disrupting global supply chains and leaving customer service teams scrambling to manage the fallout. This is one of the key discussion areas at next week's CXOutsourcers 'Mindshare"" Forum, in Munich, Germany. In","Multinational companies appear to be hitting pause on their future plans amid growing fears of a potential trade war. Geopolitical friction is already disrupting global supply chains and leaving customer service teams scrambling to manage the fallout. This is one of the key discussion areas at next week’s CXOutsourcers ‘Mindshare” Forum , in Munich, Germany. In this context of uncertainty, we sat down with Peter Ryan , founder of Ryan Strategic Advisory, to delve into the current opportunities and challenges shaping the global customer experience (CX) landscape. Ryan is a founding member of CXOutsourcers, which annually hosts the Mindshare Event — an industry gathering focused on assessing the global CX and BPO sectors. Designed specifically for Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) professionals, the forum is geared toward empowering C-suite executives with research and strategic insights to drive business performance. More than 120 CX leaders from across the globe are expected to attend. Below are excerpts from the interview with Peter Ryan. NSAM: What advice would you give to contact center providers who are heavily reliant on U.S. customers, especially now that the geopolitical order has shifted under President Donald Trump? Ryan: First, I’d say — don’t panic. Anyone considering the U.S. market shouldn’t abandon it entirely. Yes, there’s a lot of confusion right now. The next few months are going to be political — shaping the direction of what the U.S. plans to do, and how its trade and tariff policies play out. But at this stage, it’s anyone’s guess. There’s still immense value in the U.S. from an outsourcing perspective. So, I’d tell anyone eyeing the U.S. as a potential market: stay clear-eyed, observe closely, but don’t write it off. NSAM: Contact center providers serving U.S. customers seem to be in serious trouble these days, especially with the dollar index plunging to 99. Anything below 100 could deal a devastating blow to providers that are heavily dependent on U.S. clients. How do you suggest they tackle this crisis? Ryan: Well, there’s a lot of volatility out there. Strategic planning is key. Providers must work with people who understand currency fluctuations and risk management — people who can hedge against currency risk using the right tools. Now, while the dollar has appreciated and other currencies have weakened, that may actually benefit offshore providers. For buyers in the U.S., outsourcing just became cheaper. So, depending on how the currency arbitrage plays out, this could increase the appeal of offshore destinations — making U.S. companies more inclined to spend. NSAM: You once told us that most people still prefer speaking to a human rather than a machine in contact centers. So, AI bots wouldn’t be as successful as we initially expected. But these days, many BPOs are deploying chatbots — and laying off human agents. Do you still hold that view, or should service providers adapt and embrace AI? Ryan: I don’t believe there’s a massive wave of agents losing their jobs due to AI. Our research shows that while there has been some displacement, it’s mostly roles that were bound to be automated anyway — like changing an address, or resetting a password. What we’re really seeing now is AI being used to enable agents, not replace them. Yes, some contact centers are moving toward automation or AI-driven models. But I don’t think we’ll see a full-scale shift — at least not in the near or medium term. Maybe in the long term, depending on how you define that. There’s been a lot of hype over the last two and a half years about what AI can do. But when it comes to generative AI in customer service, the hype hasn’t fully matched the delivery — at least, not yet. NSAM: Stock prices of major voice-based BPO providers have taken a hit in recent months. Investors seem to believe that AI bots will take over the customer service industry. What’s your take on this, as an industry analyst? Ryan: You have to look at what triggered the drop in stock prices. It started when a Scandinavian fintech company announced they were shifting all customer service work to AI bots. Naturally, that spooked the outsourcing market. But interestingly, that same fintech recently reversed its decision — bringing the work back to human agents. Why? Because the AI tech simply wasn’t mature enough to deliver the kind of customer experience they needed. So yes, stock price movements are a concern, and investor expectations are clearly a big part of that. But I think we’re now seeing a rebalancing — a recalibration — of how the market perceives AI’s role in CX. NSAM: We recently met the owner of a contact center firm in India. He suggested that service providers should look for countries where agents can speak multiple languages. That way, they can serve a diverse customer base from a single site. He also said new technologies make it easier to handle different accents. Do you think that’s a useful strategy? Ryan: It’s definitely a valid suggestion. In fact, there are already several multilingual hubs around the world doing exactly that. We also have advanced tools now — from automatic translation to accent neutralization — that make multilingual service much more seamless. But the key thing to understand is: there’s no one-size-fits-all strategy. The right approach depends on the company, the industry it’s in, and the markets it serves. So while multilingual hubs are valuable, companies need to align their CX strategy with their specific business goals and customer demographics. NSAM: Which country do you think is making a significant mark in the CX services sector globally? Ryan: The Philippines is doing a fantastic job — as is India. These two are consistently among the most highly rated and preferred destinations by buyers, according to our research. South Africa and Egypt are also standouts. In Latin America, Mexico is a strong favorite, along with Colombia. And in the Caribbean, Jamaica has always impressed us. I was genuinely pleased with what I saw recently during an event hosted by the Jamaican outsourcing sector. In Central and Eastern Europe, there are great success stories coming out of Albania, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria. So, I wouldn’t say there’s one country that’s head and shoulders above the rest. Instead, what we’re seeing is each country carving out its own niche — finding its sweet spot in the industry. The key is that quality locations are stepping up, refining their game, and striving to deliver the best experiences and outcomes. NSAM: What can these executives expect to learn if they participate in the CXOutsourcers’ event in Munich? Why is it important not to miss it? Ryan: This event is crucial for anyone who wants to understand the future of CX — and how outsourcers must pivot to stay competitive through 2025 and into 2026. We’ll dive into key topics like geopolitical disruption, digital transformation, and emerging technologies. We’ll also explore how outsourcing firms can position themselves as influential players — not just vendors — in their respective ecosystems. Plus, we’ll examine new opportunities in emerging verticals and markets. It’s going to be packed with valuable insights. Any executive who wants to stay ahead of the curve simply shouldn’t miss it.

As of February, output rose 5.7% year-on-year — marking the fourth consecutive month of growth and the strongest pace since June 2022. The IMF expects the country to register 5.5% growth for 2025. According to President Milei, the economy is expanding at an ‘unadjusted’ annual rate of 10%. This turnaround didn’t happen by chance. It came only after Milei took aim at two of Argentina’s most entrenched problems: a volatile currency and runaway inflation. The Shock Therapy During his election campaign, Milei wielded a symbolic chainsaw, vowing to slash public spending. Once in office, he fulfilled his promise. Austerity hit like a hammer blow. Within months, real public spending was slashed by 30%, as the President cut subsidies for gas, electricity, and other public utilities. More than 36,000 public sector employees were laid off. Twelve ministries were eliminated. Four others — Education, Labor, Social Development, and Culture — were merged into a single super-ministry called Human Capital. Initially, the shock therapy lived up to its name — shocking even the president. For weeks, Buenos Aires’ international airport appeared eerily empty. Trains and subways fell silent. Garbage piled up on the streets as thousands of public workers went on strike in protest. Yet beneath the mounting social tension, the economic logic began to take hold. Inflation, which had soared to nearly 300% annually , finally began to fall. Next came a wave of deregulation. The Milei administration eliminated state controls, including those on house rent and consumer prices. As supply increased, rents dropped over a matter of months. “I lived a year in Argentina in the mid-2010s, and the economy at that time was in a terrible state — shortages, currency controls, out-of-control inflation, clogged ports — you name it. I was not optimistic about it ever turning around,” said Fergus Hodgson, Director at Econ Americas , a US-based financial consultancy, and author of The Latin America Red Pill . Hodgson, however, disagrees with labeling Milei’s policies as “shock therapy.” “He cannot — and has not — enacted the kind of shock therapy he would ideally like to. Still, he has generated many positive outcomes in just a year and a half.” Devaluing Currency Still, many economists argue Milei’s decision to devalue the peso was a textbook case of shock therapy. The president devalued the official exchange rate by more than 50% — a bold move to align it more closely with the black-market “blue dollar” rate. Rather than defending the peso through artificial means, the government allowed market forces to set its value. This began restoring investor confidence and gradually squeezed out parallel currency markets. The result was dramatic. By the end of 2024, inflation had plunged to 118% — a drop of 44.5 percentage points in just one year. The decline continued. By March 2025, annual inflation had fallen to 55.9%. Projections suggest it could dip below 30% before the year ends. To attract foreign investment, his government introduced the RIGI regime — a landmark policy that offers 30 years of fiscal and regulatory stability, tax cuts, and trade incentives for large-scale projects (above $200 million). The framework protects investors against adverse policy shifts and guarantees compensation if these protections are violated. By February 2025, the results were beginning to show. At least 10 energy projects worth a combined $11.593 billion had been submitted under the new regime. In mining, six projects totaling nearly $15 billion were in the pipeline. In April, Milei secured a $20 billion loan from the IMF to support his market-oriented reforms and the dismantling of years of currency and capital controls.

That experience opened","When Debra Fraser first came to Jamaica from Canada in 2000 on a church mission trip, she never imagined she’d play a growing role in the Caribbean’s fast-growing business process outsourcing industry. After two years of volunteering, Fraser joined Vistaprint in 2003 as an HR leader, helping the company expand into Jamaica. That experience opened her eyes to the hurdles foreign businesses often face when setting up shop in the region, from recruiting local talent to managing wage expectations and understanding government incentives. “Vistaprint did a fantastic job, but it was so much work, trial and error,” Fraser said. “It kind of developed a desire in me to help other companies to not have to go through that.” By 2010, she had started her own call center, which grew to about 50 employees before financial limitations forced her to reposition. She launched an HR outsourcing firm , assisting other companies with their Caribbean operations, often stepping in as the official employer of record. Her company has since had a major impact on Jamaica’s BPO sector, which has grown from around 5,000 workers twenty years ago to about 60,000 today. As a part of that growth, her team recruited over 1,100 employees for ibex, a major BPO company. From the ground up Entrepreneurship is essential across the Caribbean, but it comes along with well-established risks. Small- and medium-sized enterprises make up 99.5% of businesses and provide about 60% of formal jobs, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Nevertheless, these businesses often struggle to get financing, secure collateral, or tap into robust capital markets. “Banks want assets. If you don’t have property, it’s hard to grow,” Fraser said. “There aren’t many grants or angel investors here. I’ve thought about registering my business elsewhere just to access capital.” Jamaica has improved its business climate in recent years and now ranks 71st in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index. After four decades of little to no improvement, the island is expected to see 1 to 2% annual growth over the medium term, according to World Bank Group. Mortgage rates have come down from 17% to about 8%, and the Jamaican dollar is seeing some stability amid a weakening U.S. dollar, Fraser said. Still, many startups have no choice but to bootstrap. Fraser considers herself lucky that she was able to use family-owned land as leverage to secure funding for her endeavors. Today, her company serves clients around the world and specializes in remote-first hiring. This approach eliminates the need for expensive office space by finding skilled workers for businesses that operate virtually — a trend that gained momentum during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Our clients cut 70% off labor costs by hiring in Jamaica,” she said. “And they’re getting high-quality workers with years of BPO experience. It’s a no-brainer.” Fraser believes smaller firms like hers are well-suited to succeed, especially as larger BPO providers deal with increasing costs. She also points to rising competition from gig economy platforms like Fiverr and Upwork, which attract Caribbean freelancers but don’t contribute to local tax systems. “The gig economy is already here,” Fraser said. “But if you’re not on a payroll, you can’t access benefits like Jamaica’s housing trust. That’s a missed opportunity for both workers and the country.” The fight to stay competitive Nearby, countries like Trinidad and Tobago are pouring money into the sector — more than $245 million — to create thousands of new jobs. With strong English language skills and proximity to the U.S., the Caribbean takes advantage of the typical nearshore selling points. But Fraser warns that to stay competitive, the region needs better policies, more funding opportunities, and stronger digital infrastructure. “The labor is here, the skills are here,” she said. “What we need now is better support for the people building the future from the ground up.” According to the Global Services Association of Jamaica, about 70 companies make up the country’s BPO sector. And while some worry artificial intelligence could replace jobs, GSAJ President Wayne Sinclair believes technology could improve productivity and lead to new roles. The global services sector remains a major job engine, with a 61.5% jump in employment over the past eight years, according to Minister of Industry, Investment and Commerce Senator Aubyn Hill.

https://latamlist.com/8-uruguayan-startups-to-watch-in-2025/,8 Uruguayan Startups to Watch in 2025,2025-03-10T19:49:34+00:00,"These 8 startups are the most funded in Uruguay, leading the country’s tech boom. Learn about how they’re shaping Latin America’s tech scene.","Uruguay is one of Latin America’s smallest countries—with just 3.4M people, it is far smaller than cities like São Paulo ( 22.6M ), Mexico City ( 22.3M ), and Buenos Aires ( 15.49M ). But that hasn’t stopped Uruguay from punching above its weight on the international stage, and its national soccer team is proof: Uruguay has won 15 Copa Americas , second only to Argentina, along with two World Cups and two Olympic gold medals . Beyond sports, Uruguay has the highest GDP per capita in Latin America at $22.5K , standing out as an economic leader. Over the years, Uruguay has positioned itself as a hub for local startups and foreign investment through public policies like: But when did Uruguay become a technology powerhouse, and how did it become one of Latin America’s success cases? If you heard about Uruguay’s first unicorn in 2016, you’d never guess that it was an overnight success three decades in the making. Long before startups became popular in Latin America, three Uruguayan founders launched Scanntech in 1992 to help retail companies improve operations through technology–yes, before  MercadoLibre . Today, Scanntech provides software solutions to 450 of the world’s top 500 retailers, offering tools like ScannMarket for market and competitor analysis, ScannView for pricing optimization and product mix insights, and PromoClub for managing promotions at the point of sale. Nearly two decades later, PedidosYa launched in 2009 as a food delivery app and B2B last-mile logistics platform, helping restaurants and e-commerce businesses cut delivery costs and simplify operations. PedidosYa is now present in 15 Latin American countries and was acquired by Delivery Hero in 2014. In 2016, dLocal launched as a cross-border payment processor, connecting global merchants with emerging markets, becoming a unicorn in 2020 and IPO’ing on the NASDAQ in 2021—only the second Uruguayan company to reach Wall Street after StarMedia in 1999. Beyond its success in payments, dLocal has quietly become a launchpad for Latin American entrepreneurs. Joaquin Colella and Ilan Bajarlia , former software developer and head of sales at dLocal, now lead Nocnoc. Ex-dLocal executives Michel Golffed and Rodrigo Sánchez Prandi are driving fintech innovation at Brinta. Meanwhile, dLocal co-founder Sergio Fogel has turned his focus to Datanomik. All three of these companies–Scanntech, PedidosYa, and dLocal–have one thing in common: they’re headquartered in Montevideo, the beating heart of Uruguay’s tech scene and home to around 500 startups as of 2024. The Uruguayan capital is one of the most prominent emerging tech hubs in Latin America, with more VC-backed startups than cities like Monterrey, Medellin, Curitiba and Belo Horizonte. Now that you know why you should keep an eye out, let’s get into the 8 Uruguayan companies that, according to public data, have raised over $5M in venture capital funding and remain independent—meaning they haven’t been acquired, reached unicorn status, or gone public yet.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/the-six-countries-where-taxes-wont-crush-you/,The Six Countries Where Taxes Won’t Crush You - Nearshore Americas,2025-05-15T16:37:09+00:00,Latin America offers lawful and strategic avenues to significantly reduce your tax liability—sometimes to nearly zero.,"While certain Latin American countries do levy substantial taxes, there are lawful and strategic avenues to significantly reduce tax liability, sometimes to nearly zero. This is particularly true in jurisdictions that operate under a territorial tax system, where income earned outside the country is entirely exempt from local taxation . Expatriates can fully enjoy the local lifestyle and amenities without being taxed on their foreign earnings. In some cases, foreigners can even retain non-resident status while continuing to benefit from the country’s infrastructure, climate and community offerings. For Americans relocating to these nations, the advantages are twofold: they can legally minimize exposure to U.S. income taxes through established IRS mechanisms, while also benefiting from lower living costs and the natural beauty that many of these countries offer. In fact, certain Latin American jurisdictions have income tax regimes that rival even those of low-tax hubs like Dubai. By deriving income from foreign employment or operating an offshore business, it’s not uncommon to find a minimal local income tax burden by the end of the year. Corporate tax policies in the region are equally attractive. Guatemala, for instance, levies just a 7% corporate tax, making it one of the most favorable jurisdictions for business in Latin America. Paraguay is another standout, capping corporate taxes at 10%. U.S. citizens are taxed on their worldwide income, regardless of residency. However, mechanisms like the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion and the Foreign Tax Credit can mitigate double taxation. Here is a closer look at some of these countries and the tax advantages they offer: Uruguay Often praised for its high personal safety standards , Uruguay also boasts natural beauty and a pleasant climate. Its tax policies are highly favorable, especially for foreign professionals. For those in software or other skilled sectors, Uruguay will be an ideal country to live in. The government offers a 10-year tax holiday on foreign income, allowing many expats to legally avoid paying any income tax for an entire decade. Local income is taxed at just 12%, and even tax residents find the burden comparatively light when measured against developed nations. Some foreign residents choose to permanently settle in Uruguay, giving up the tax holiday in exchange for a reduced 7% tax rate on their foreign income — an option exclusively available to non-natives. Chile Chile stands out as one of the more affluent countries in Latin America. Holding a Chilean passport grants visa-free access to numerous countries, including the United States. Chile provides a three-year tax exemption on foreign income, with a possible extension to six years. After five years of residency, individuals are eligible to apply for citizenship. The Dominican Republic The Dominican Republic offers a three-year tax holiday, and it does not tax income earned from foreign employment. For those working for an overseas company while living in the country, there are no income tax liabilities. That said, the Dominican Republic follows a semi-territorial tax system. This means that while employment income from abroad is exempt, some domestic earnings, such as rental income and capital gains, are subject to taxation. Importantly, the Dominican Republic does not enforce Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) rules. This is a key advantage for international entrepreneurs. Under current Dominican tax law, individuals and businesses are not required to pay tax on the retained earnings of their foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Dominican Republic offers a citizenship-by-investment pathway. By investing in local real estate, you can become eligible for a Dominican passport. You may also qualify for tax residency simply by living in the country for more than six months in a year. Panama Panama operates under a strict territorial tax system, allowing foreign residents to legally avoid taxes on any income earned outside the country. This makes it a compelling destination for remote workers and international entrepreneurs. Residency is accessible — staying in Panama for more than six months in rented accommodation makes you eligible to apply. Beyond its favorable tax laws, Panama is known for its modern infrastructure, stability, and peaceful lifestyle, making it a long-time favorite among expats . Guatemala While Guatemala may lack the high-end infrastructure of other countries, its tax policies are highly attractive to foreign nationals. The country does not tax foreign income, offering a clear incentive for remote workers and offshore business owners. Even local income is taxed at just 7%, making Guatemala one of the most tax-efficient countries in Central America. For those looking to establish an offshore business, Guatemala presents a cost-effective and tax-friendly environment. Paraguay Paraguay stands out as one of the best options for launching an offshore business in Latin America. The country not only exempts foreign income from taxation but also maintains one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the region — just 10%. Both personal and corporate taxes are capped at 10%, providing an exceptionally simple and attractive framework for international investors and business owners. Paraguay also adheres to a territorial tax system, ensuring that all income earned outside the country is completely tax-free . Combined with its ease of business incorporation and high personal safety, Paraguay is a prime destination for those seeking long-term financial efficiency.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/aws-mexico-explained-a-new-tech-cornerstone-in-mexico/,AWS Mexico Explained: A New Tech Cornerstone in Mexico - Nearshore Americas,2025-02-06T16:55:16+00:00,"""I believe the new Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud 'region' will bring a lot to Mexico and all its industries,"" says David Victoria, a Senior Cloud Architect for Caylent in Latin America and one of the main ambassadors of Amazon's newest technology project. ""However, I still think there's many things to ask Santa for."" Querétaro","“I believe the new Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud ‘region’ will bring a lot to Mexico and all its industries,” says David Victoria , a Senior Cloud Architect for Caylent in Latin America and one of the main ambassadors of Amazon’s newest technology project. “However, I still think there’s many things to ask Santa for.” Querétaro is the second Latin American city to host an AWS Region, following São Paulo. This Region, with three Availability Zones accessible via the API code mx-central-1 , will offer low-latency cloud services, enhanced data sovereignty, and increased opportunities for digital transformation. It expands upon Amazon’s existing Local Zone (smaller-scale data center deployments) in Querétaro and Points of Presence (PoPs, which are caché storing edge locations) in Monterrey, Puebla, Tlalnepantla, Tlaquepaque, Torreón and Querétaro. The news comes at a time when costs for software development in Mexico are increasingly becoming less of an advantage. Fortunately, the AWS region addresses the remaining two factors of the “Iron Triangle” in nearshoring IT services. With cost competitiveness fading, the industry is now prioritizing faster delivery and higher-quality end products. According to Mexican Tech Expert Enrique Cortés-Rello , AWS Mexico has contributed significantly to boost the region’s tech ecosystem. “It consolidates the country as the region’s main technology hub. More cloud computing infrastructure means a stronger appeal for business and a wider array of available computing tools for companies, entrepreneurs, governments, and academia.” The US tech giant has recently announced plans to invest $5 billion in Mexico over the next 15 years. This investment is expected to create 7,000 jobs and contribute $10 billion to the country’s GDP. This investment also promises to boost the nation’s digital future. The cloud initiative’s hardware and software are being implemented alongside a comprehensive community building program and robust sustainability protocols and projects. These initiatives demonstrate the company’s awareness of protests in Latin America surrounding data center deployment and environmental concerns. According to David, the program includes: Most sustainability strategies appear to have a long-term focus, leaving uncertainty about whether AWS can respond swiftly and effectively to the pressing challenges in cloud and AI development. That said, the AWS Mexico Region has introduced initiatives to promote STEM education and provide targeted support for women and children pursuing careers in IT. Among the most significant efforts is a $300,000 fund dedicated to advancing technology-focused community projects in Querétaro. “In the past, businesses had to purchase expensive hardware, install it on-premises, and maintain it themselves,” says David. “With cloud computing, companies can rent infrastructure on demand, scaling up or down as needed, without large upfront costs.” AWS Availability Zones provide a robust platform for complex code loading, execution, testing, and development. This results in faster application performance, a better user experience, and new opportunities for industries dependent on real-time computing. These benefits extend beyond Mexico; having AWS data centers geographically closer should reduce friction in client experience and enhance software design capabilities. AWS offers Amazon Connect, a cloud-based call center solution that streamlines communication and improves service quality. David explained that, with the impact of a local AWS Region on the available digital infrastructure landscape, call centers can anticipate lower call drop rates and improved voice quality, reduced latency for real-time customer interactions, and increased scalability, enabling businesses to adjust resources according to demand. For developers and tech companies exporting services internationally, utilizing a local cloud region offers numerous advantages. “We say ‘cloud is your new local’,” David remarks, emphasizing that the infrastructure provided by AWS includes a sophisticated, extensive, and unique coding toolkit designed to support the majority of software development needs. From a business perspective, this translates to faster development cycles, achieved through testing and deploying software closer to end-users; lower costs compared to hosting services in distant regions; and facilitated global expansion via a multi-region cloud architecture. Both providers and consumers in the nearshore model will benefit from the ability to extend their service offerings to industries demanding high data sovereignty or low-latency standards previously unattainable. Organizations in sectors like banking, government, and healthcare can now leverage cloud services to achieve their objectives, overcoming regulatory hurdles that previously mandated in-country data hosting. However, there comes David’s most serious critique of the AWS Region: “Unfortunately, it doesn’t come with all the functions”. Take Hardware Security Modules : a high-level, coding-heavy security procedure used to record, archive and utilize sensitive data. It is now standard for a lot of licensing on cybersecurity. “Yet it is not available to utilize for the AWS Mexico Region. It is a function of data infrastructure that has been deployed in other AWS regions.” Cortés-Rello explained it’s common for different cloud service regions to include different services. “It depends on hardware and software implemented on the region’s data centers. For example, US Regions provide services aligned with HIPAA (US health regulation standards). That is not that important for us.” David expressed his hope that this exclusion is only temporary. He emphasized the lack of logic in omitting high-end security functions, particularly given the rise of increasingly complex cyberattacks and widespread concerns about data safety, especially when deploying technology designed to create faster, better products that aim to bolster digital sovereignty. AWS’s expansion into Mexico is more than just an investment in infrastructure—it’s a gateway to digital transformation for businesses of all sizes. While the project may not yet be flawless, and while it may present sustainability challenges, it undeniably demonstrates that long-term, focused private investment can, at times, drive greater resources toward digital transformation than government initiatives. Collaboration between the two can further accelerate the region’s pursuit of competitiveness in digital markets. With the offer of lower latency, improved security, and sustainable computing, Amazon’s move can accelerate cloud adoption across industries. As businesses in Mexico and Latin America embrace cloud technologies, they will be better positioned to compete globally, innovate faster, and reduce operational costs. For companies considering cloud migration, now is the time to take advantage of AWS’s growing presence in Latin America—leveraging world-class cloud services, closer to home. Other experts agree with Victoria and Cortés-Rello on their enthusiasm for the project, noting that it solidifies Querétaro’s position as a host city for “regions” established by all major cloud service providers (Oracle, Google, Microsoft, and AWS). However, they also emphasize the potential for further investment to explore other areas of the web services supply chain. In Cortés-Rello’s words: “investment should now go to creation and not only to cloud services provision. To complement this technological leap, we need investment in startups and advanced R&D in Mexico. We can’t just be consumers. We [as an increasingly leading country in the tech sector] need to turn into creators.” Colombian business, politics, and cultural journalist. Managing Editor for Nearshore Americas and El Enemigo.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/pandemic-shift-reversed-latam-heads-back-to-office/,Pandemic Shift Reversed? LatAm Heads Back to Office - Nearshore Americas,2025-01-21T18:39:50+00:00,"Across Latin America, the remote work revolution appears to be grinding to a halt.","Across Latin America, the remote work revolution appears to be grinding to a halt. As 2025 progresses, offices are reclaiming their dominance, and the work-from-home era looks increasingly like a fleeting pandemic experiment. The region is now leading the world in five-day in-person work, according to a recent JLL real estate consultancy study. Six out of ten companies in the region have already ditched remote arrangements, pulling their workforce back to desks. Peru stands out for its tough stance—remote work is almost extinct. Barely 10% of service sector workers still work from home. Meanwhile, other countries are following suit: Colombia sees 72% of its workforce back in offices, Brazil 60%, Chile 56%, and Mexico 54%. In Peru, of the 764 companies that adopted remote work during the pandemic, a staggering 90% plan to fully return to in-office setups by early 2025, according to ResumeBuilder.com . Real estate lobbying, unmotivated employees, and strict government regulations are collectively casting a shadow over the future of remote work. There are cultural factors also, stated Mark Beyer, founder of Mybey Ventures . “Supervisors in Latin America often prefer direct oversight. Remote work disrupts this dynamic, leaving managers uneasy about accountability and day-to-day control.” In Mexico, many firms have ended remote work due to concerns about decreased productivity and difficulties in maintaining employee oversight. “The culture in Mexico is not one of a lot of trust. Companies feel that during the Pandemic many employees started to abuse the home office situation, not being controlled by the management,” said Peter Kroll , Country Manager for Novacomp in Mexico. “Productivity of many workers went down when working 100% remotely and companies believe this is because there were too many distractions working from home.” Some countries introduced remote work regulations to benefit employees, but ironically, these measures indirectly pressured companies to abandon remote working altogether. In Mexico, for instance, government required companies to pay for home office essentials—chairs, internet, electricity—and take responsibility for employee health and safety at home. “This is difficult to implement,” says Kroll. “Many companies simply don’t want to bear these risks.” The primary argument, says Dionisio Chiuratto Agourakis , CEO of JAI , a São Paulo-based company that offers AI support to boost productivity, is that in-person work is more productive than remote work. “This is especially relevant for junior employees, who miss out on the benefits of being in a physical workplace, such as learning from colleagues, observing workplace dynamics, and improving through direct interactions.” A less-discussed but growing issue, Agourakis said, was  the trend of employees holding multiple full-time remote jobs simultaneously—sometimes as many as three or four—without informing their employers. This behaviour, widely discussed by employees on Reddit and Twitter, has made companies more skeptical about remote work, he added. “In Brazil, some organizations implemented strict measures such as requiring webcams and microphones to be on during work hours, or monitoring keyboard and mouse activity, to ensure productivity.” The Challenge of Retaining Staff With the decline in remote work, retaining employees will become a significant challenge for companies already grappling with talent shortages. In late 2024, workforce analytics firm Revelio uncovered a troubling trend: return-to-office (RTO) policies were shrinking workforces in many organizations. Analyzing hiring and attrition data from public U.S. companies, Revelio found a stark contrast. Since June 2022, when RTO mandates gained momentum, firms offering flexible work have grown their workforce by 1.6%, compared to just 1% growth for companies enforcing in-office attendance. “Yes, companies are aware that they will lose precious talent. But it was inevitable” Agourakis added. Ultimately, companies may need to explore ways to adapt teleworking model to improve employee retention. In a similar JLL survey conducted in 2024 , 62% of respondents said they may plan to create a network of workspaces closer to employees’ homes, aiming to make the transition more appealing and retain talent.

SoftBank and General Atlantic co-led the round, which closed in March 2025. Kavak also secured $400M in debt from Goldman Sachs and HSBC to expand lending through Kuna Capital , its financing arm. “My opinion on ‘up rounds’ and ‘down rounds’ is simple: entrepreneurs should focus on developing the long-term potential of their company and taking care of customers, employees, and shareholders along the way,” said Carlos García Ottati , CEO and co-founder of Kavak. Kavak runs an integrated platform for buying, selling, and financing used cars across Latin America. Kavak will use the capital to grow its lending operation, improve core operations in Mexico, and prepare for a potential IPO within three to five years. Kavak reports that inventory is rotating 3.5x faster than the previous year, with monthly volume up 60%, and Kuna has issued nearly $1B in loans over the past four years. “We’ve reached profitability in some markets within a few months. We haven’t achieved full-year profitability yet, but we’re on track to reach it across all markets in 2025, hopefully by the end of the year,” added García Ottati. Founded in 2016, Kavak reduced its headcount by half to 4,300 employees, shut down operations in Colombia and Peru in 2023 , and now generates 60% of its business in Mexico.

https://nearshoreamericas.com/chile-and-puerto-rico-latams-top-digitally-competitive-economies/,Chile and Puerto Rico: LatAm’s Top Digitally Competitive Economies - Nearshore Americas,2024-12-17T18:12:30+00:00,"Poor educational system and reluctance to embrace new technology weakening digital competency in LatAm, but Chile and Puerto Rico shine as beacons of hope.","The poor educational system and reluctance to embrace new technology solutions are weakening the digital competency of many Latin American countries. Yet, Chile and Puerto Rico shine as beacons of hope, according to the Digital Competitiveness Ranking , prepared by Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development (IMD). Strong ICT infrastructure and pro-business policies are driving digital transformation in Chile and Puerto Rico. However, when it comes to technology integration, every country in the region lags. The report emphasizes that adopting new technologies is no longer optional but essential for economic growth. Delays in tech adoption could widen the digital divide, hampering progress and limiting economic potential. The IMD highlights technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and quantum computing as key drivers of economic growth. AI, for instance, can enhance productivity , blockchain can improve governance transparency and reduce corruption, while quantum computing can bolster research and innovation. The IMD analyzed seven countries: Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Peru, and Venezuela. The report’s analysts have urged Mexico to alleviate business community concerns by reducing policy uncertainty and strengthening democratic institutions. Argentina, the analysts insist, should liberalize forex regulations and mitigate the impact of economic turmoil on businesses to support its digital companies. Brazil, the region’s largest economy, lags in many segments of the digital economy, primarily due to a lack of quality education, which perpetuates a talent shortage. Colombia, according to the report, is preparing well for the future but is slow to adopt cutting-edge technologies like AI and quantum computing. Sporadic power outages in recent months are deterring investors, the report warns, suggesting that Colombia should rebuild its power infrastructure. Chile: the Rising Star Chile slipped from 39th to 42nd in the latest ranking compared to 2021. Despite this decline, the country’s strong ICT infrastructure and expansive data center networks position it well to harness advanced technologies. Valparaíso , a key port city, leads the way with average internet speeds of 321.85 Mbps, outperforming many U.S. cities and ranking as the world’s fastest for network access, according to the Global Speedtest Index . Pablo Rossel Estay, head of BPO firm CGS’s operations in Chile , credits the country’s ICT advancements to its telecom sector liberalization in the 1980s. “Large-scale projects like the Humboldt Cable—a 14,000 km undersea link connecting Chile to Australia—have further reinforced Chile’s role as a regional data center hub,” he explained. While the report highlights significant efficiency gains among Chilean businesses and improved access to finance, Claudia Perez, IT and Technology Recruitment Specialist at Robert Walters in Chile, sees challenges, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). “Many smaller businesses still struggle due to limited resources for digital transformation,” she noted. A digital transformation law enacted in 2019 mandates technological adoption, but implementation has been sluggish. Cybersecurity, however, has seen notable progress, with stricter regulations enacted to safeguard personal information. “Chile’s laws progress slowly, creating a complex regulatory environment. Some initiatives, like electronic signatures and data governance policies, have helped regulate aspects of the digital economy. Still, there’s much more to be done,” she added. One of Chile’s most pressing issues remains the shortage of qualified tech talent. “While Chile has a sizable pool of tech professionals, the situation is complicated. Many lack certifications or the necessary skills for emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI),” Perez added. The problem is exacerbated as foreign companies attract top talent with competitive salaries and fully remote work opportunities.  Perez warns that a lack of advanced training and low technical skills could stifle Chile’s digital growth. Promising Puerto Rico Like Chile, Puerto Rico benefits from a strong ICT infrastructure. Despite the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017, the US territory rebounded quickly. “Puerto Rico has a limited data center, peering, and cloud infrastructure. However, it does host landing stations for over a dozen submarine cables,” says Jon Hjembo , Senior Research Manager at TeleGeography . Hjembo believes Puerto Rico could see more submarine cables running through its territory in the years to come. “San Juan serves as a key node for cables spanning Latin America, the Caribbean, and the continental U.S.,” he adds. However, Puerto Rico faces a worsening talent shortage, a challenge similar to other Latin American nations. According to Boston Consulting Group, only 2.8% of the island’s workforce is employed in the digital sector, compared to up to 10% in comparable markets. Higher education institutions are another weak point, producing only about 100 graduates annually in high-tech fields. Many of these graduates leave the island for better opportunities and higher salaries, particularly on the US mainland.
