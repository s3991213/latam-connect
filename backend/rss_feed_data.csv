El estado actual del mercado de capital riesgo para startups fundadas por mujeres,https://contxto.com/en/america-latina/el-estado-actual-del-mercado-de-capital-riesgo-para-startups-fundadas-por-mujeres/,"Fri, 11 Apr 2025 02:57:15 +0000","En 2024, las empresas con al menos una mujer fundadora recaudaron 38.800 millones de dólares en fondos de capital riesgo, lo que representa un aumento del 27% con respecto al año anterior. Sin embargo, esta cifra sigue estando muy por debajo del máximo histórico de 62.500 millones de dólares alcanzado en 2021. Las cifras son resultado del informe All In: Female Founders in the VC Ecosystem, publicado por PitchBook, que analiza el estado actual de las mujeres emprendedoras en el ecosistema de capital riesgo. A pesar del crecimiento en la recaudación de fondos, el informe hace una advertencia en que los cambios en las actitudes públicas, incluido un movimiento contra las políticas de diversidad, equidad e inclusión (DEI), podrían dificultar aún más que las mujeres fundadoras accedan a financiamiento. Si bien la orden ejecutiva de Donald Trump, que prohíbe a las agencias federales y contratistas gubernamentales emplear programas de DEI, aún no ha mostrado su impacto completo debido a impugnaciones judiciales, su eventual implementación podría afectar significativamente a las mujeres que buscan emprender. El informe de PitchBook revela un panorama complejo para las mujeres que buscan capital para sus startups. Aunque el número de acuerdos de financiación para empresas fundadas por mujeres disminuyó un 13% en 2024, el aumento en la financiación se concentró en empresas en etapas posteriores que recaudaron sumas más grandes. Pero existe una cifra todavía más alarmante: las startups fundadas por mujeres recibieron solo el 1% de la financiación de capital riesgo y representaron apenas el 6% de todos los acuerdos. En comparación, las empresas fundadas por hombres y mujeres en conjunto obtuvieron el 20% de la financiación y el 25% de los acuerdos, según Female Foundry. Tan solo 13 empresas fundadas por mujeres alcanzaron el estatus de unicornio, es decir, una valoración superior a los 1.000 millones de dólares. Entre ellas destacan Ayar Labs, Writer, Physical Intelligence, The Row, World Labs, EliseAI, Chainguard, Cart.com, Xpansiv, Alumis, Züm, Monad Labs y Celestial AI. Sectores donde las mujeres destacan A pesar de los desafíos, las empresarias están destacando en sectores clave como la biotecnología, la tecnología financiera (fintech) y el software, particularmente en áreas como la productividad empresarial, el software financiero y el descubrimiento de fármacos. Uno de los hallazgos del informe Female Innovation Index 2025, es que las mujeres en el sector deep tech están recaudando más capital que sus contrapartes masculinos. Esto se debe en parte a los vínculos de este sector con la academia, donde las mujeres tienden a estar representadas de manera más equitativa. En Europa, el 33 % del capital de riesgo recaudado por mujeres emprendedoras se destina a startups de deep tech, un 2% más que en startups sin distinción de género. Además, a medida que estas empresas crecen, su valoración no aumenta al mismo ritmo que las fundadas por hombres. Por ejemplo, las empresas fundadas por mujeres en etapa de crecimiento tardío o de riesgo se valoraron en 46,8 millones de dólares, en comparación con el promedio estadounidense de 67 millones de dólares. Según el informe, solo el 17,3 % de las personas que toman decisiones en empresas con más de 50 millones de dólares en activos bajo administración son mujeres. El panorama no es diferente en otras regiones El desafío no se limita a Estados Unidos. En Europa, la inversión de riesgo en startups fundadas por mujeres disminuyó un 12% en 2024. Países como el Reino Unido, Francia y Alemania lideran la lista de inversiones en empresas fundadas por mujeres, mientras que Finlandia y Dinamarca tienen la mayor proporción de capital de riesgo asignado a este tipo de startups. En Latinoamérica, la situación es aún más crítica. Solo el 6% de los fondos de inversión estan apuntando a empresas lideradas por mujeres, y el 73% de las pequeñas y medianas empresas (pymes) lideradas por mujeres no pueden cubrir sus necesidades de financiamiento, según el Banco Mundial. Un estudio del Banco de Desarrollo de América Latina y el Caribe (CAF) reveló que las mujeres en Colombia, por ejemplo, tienden a autoexcluirse del sistema financiero formal debido a un menor nivel de confianza en sí mismas. Ante estos desafíos, plataformas y comunidades han jugado un papel crucial en la promoción del emprendimiento femenino. A través de mentorías, eventos y acceso a inversores, estas iniciativas han permitido a muchas emprendedoras desarrollar sus proyectos en un entorno más favorable. 10 Mujeres líderes que destacan en 2025 Marlene Garayzar, Stori Marlene Garayzar es la cofundadora de Stori, la primera empresa unicornio fundada por una mujer en México y la novena empresa mexicana en convertirse en unicornio.

Costa Rican startup transforming agriculture through remote monitoring technology,https://contxto.com/en/costa-rica/costa-rican-startup-transforming-agriculture-through-remote-monitoring-technology/,"Mon, 07 Apr 2025 18:05:27 +0000","Agriculture is a key economic sector in Latin America and the Caribbean, accounting for almost 7% of the region’ s GDP. And the industry has great potential thanks to its rich agricultural diversity, with crops such as coffee, corn, pineapple, bananas, soybeans, cocoa and many others. Although the agricultural technology ecosystem in Latin America is in a stage of growth and transformation, it also faces significant challenges. The adoption of advanced technologies is still uneven and feels limited, especially in rural areas, where small and medium-sized farmers predominate. The efforts of different countries in the region to promote the environmental sustainability of the sector through policies for the adoption of sustainable practices and technologies have been fundamental for entrepreneurs to find solutions to the different problems in the agricultural technology industry. To solve many of the obstacles in terms of technology applied to agriculture, Green Xpo Lab, a Costa Rican startup dedicated to transforming agriculture through remote monitoring technology, using drones and satellite images, was born in 2022. The startup provides innovative solutions that enable food producers to make informed and sustainable decisions, optimizing their crops and increasing their profitability. Its main focus lies in empowering farmers with advanced tools to improve efficiency and sustainability in their production processes. “We address several critical issues in the region through innovative solutions. First, we provide accurate information on the measurement of productive areas and the quantification of forested areas, which is fundamental to prevent deforestation and promote sustainable practices,” Carlos Saito, CEO and founder of Green Xpo Lab, told Contxto. The Costa Rican agtech also performs plant counts to verify planting density, helping to avoid overpopulation and inefficient use of agro-inputs, thus democratizing the digital tools that farmers need to improve the profitability and sustainability of their crops. Agricultural technology infrastructure in Latin America For agricultural technology to be well implemented in the region, there must be adequate infrastructure that allows deployment in different areas of LatAm. According to a UN report, in order to establish a minimum rural infrastructure proposal for the development of rural areas in Latin America and the Caribbean, planning and investment prioritization tools are needed, with a broader view of family and territorial dynamics. The particular characteristics of rural areas introduce different development conditions. They require investments in connectivity whose costs per inhabitant are high, since in general all “networked” services (electricity, water and sewage), which are valued by the scale of care, tend to have higher costs in rural areas. “It is essential that investments be made in infrastructure, training and public policies that facilitate the adoption of these technologies. Central America has a great opportunity to take advantage of technology and improve the productivity and sustainability of its agricultural systems,” says Saito. “For this to happen, it is necessary to strengthen collaboration between the public and private sectors, ensuring that the benefits of technology reach all farmers in the region,” he adds. Types of technology implemented by Green Xpo Lab The startup uses remote monitoring technology to obtain detailed information from the field, focusing on RGB and multispectral images captured by drones. These images are crucial to develop tools that implement artificial intelligence models, allowing them to automate data analysis and provide accurate and reliable information to producers. In addition to incorporating big data and deep learning tools into their systems, which further enriches their analysis; they also work with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools to manage spatial data. This makes it possible to visualize the results of the analyses in a clear and understandable way, thus facilitating informed decision making. Integrating these technologies not only optimizes data collection, but also improves the accuracy and usefulness of the information they provide to farmers, helping them to manage their crops more efficiently. Learning from global markets North America and the European Union are among the regions leading the agricultural technology industry, improving efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability and competitiveness across the sector. The European Commission’s policy guidelines for 2024-2029 prioritize support for the entire food value chain through investment and innovation in farms, cooperatives, agribusinesses and SMEs. These types of policies should be implemented in the LatAm region in order to strengthen the industry and provide greater opportunities for both entrepreneurs and farmers. “In more advanced markets, one of the great successes has been the creation of collaborative ecosystems where farmers, technology startups, academic institutions, private companies and governments work together,” says Saito. “For example, in countries like the United States, there are agricultural innovation centers where all these actors come together to develop and test new technologies, sharing knowledge and resources. In LATAM, we have the opportunity to replicate this approach, creating local collaborative networks that include universities, research centers, governments and technology companies. These networks could focus on developing solutions tailored to local realities, as well as fostering platforms for sharing data and learning among all those involved.” In Europe, public policies have been key to the mass adoption of agricultural technology. Through subsidy programs, tax incentives and credits, farmers, especially the smallest ones, have had the opportunity to access technological tools without an overwhelming financial burden. This type of proposal could be implemented in LATAM, developing public policies that encourage the adoption of agricultural technologies, in addition to managing subsidies for the purchase of equipment, low-interest loans for farmers who are committed to innovation and programs that support small and medium-sized agricultural enterprises in their modernization, among others. “In many international markets, agricultural technologies are being offered under ‘AGTECH as a Service’ models, where farmers do not need to make large upfront investments, but pay only for the use of the technology. This includes drone services, data analysis and monitoring software, allowing farmers to access advanced technology in an affordable way. In LATAM, we could replicate this model, offering small and medium-sized farmers the possibility of paying for specific services, thus eliminating high barriers to entry and facilitating the adoption of these tools,” concludes Saito. Sustainability and climate change are themes that are increasingly resonating in the agricultural sector. Demand for agricultural practices that consider soil regeneration and carbon quantification is on the rise. Companies that integrate these practices into their services will be in an advantageous position, as international markets are increasingly looking for products that are environmentally friendly and responsible. Improved technology infrastructure is critical. As digital connectivity advances in rural areas, more farmers will have the opportunity to adopt precision farming solutions. This will not only benefit individual farmers, but will also boost the region’s competitiveness in global markets, creating a brighter and more sustainable future for all.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Fund launched to boost digital trust startups in Latin America,https://contxto.com/en/news/fund-launched-to-boost-digital-trust-startups-in-latin-america/,"Fri, 04 Apr 2025 17:57:11 +0000","In a move that seeks to boost the technology ecosystem linked to credit and digital trust, a strategic alliance between Círculo de Crédito, a company specializing in credit information in Mexico, and Seedstars, a global investment and acceleration firm, seeks to strengthen the Trust-Tech Fund. The initiative is part of Círculo de Crédito’s Corporate Venture Capital (CVC) arm, and focuses on supporting startups that develop solutions to validate identities, prevent fraud and optimize the credit cycle. According to a statement, this includes solutions with clear applications such as Trust-Tech, artificial intelligence (AI), fintech, fraud prevention, embedded finance, identity verification, alternative data, proptech, insurtech and HR-Tech among others. The Trust-Tech Fund promises more than just investments The fund, which has already opened its first call, will select the five most promising startups in the sector to offer them not only capital, but a custom-designed acceleration program. The chosen companies will receive mentoring from global experts, access to strategic networks and, above all, the possibility of integrating with the infrastructure and experience of Círculo de Crédito, which has more than two decades of experience in risk analysis and credit data. Benjamin Langer, Partner at Seedstars, told Contxto that this call will consider early-stage startups in pre-seed or seed stage with bases or operations in Mexico, with minimum viable product (MVP). Priority will be given to those with initial traction and scalability potential whose founders are committed full time, show relevant experience and have a vision of regional expansion. While other funds disperse their resources across multiple sectors, the Trust-Tech Fund is committed to a specific niche: technologies that strengthen the credibility of digital transactions, especially in the financial, real estate and credit sectors. Priority solutions include biometric validations, fraud prevention systems based on advanced data, and the use of alternative information (such as consumer habits or fingerprints) to assess risks in underserved populations. Seedstars’ involvement, with a presence in more than 90 emerging markets, adds a layer of international expertise. The firm manages seven funds with $200 million in assets and has accelerated more than 200 startups in 105 countries. “Our role is to connect entrepreneurs with global networks and potential clients,” noted Benjamin Langer. “Imagine a startup from Colombia developing facial verification: it will be able to scale its solution in Mexico or integrate it with Credit Circle tools to protect sensitive data,” he concluded. A window of opportunity In a region where digital fraud and lack of access to credit remain economic barriers, this alliance could mark a before and after. According to Juan Manuel Ruiz Palmieri, CEO of Círculo de Crédito, “Trust is the currency of the digital future.” And with the backing of a credit giant and a global investment network, the Trust-Tech Fund is not just looking for profits: it aims to redefine how Latin America navigates the challenges of identity, risk and security in the digital age. “It’s not just about funding, it’s about building bridges between disruptive technology and real market needs,” said Ruiz Palmieri. “We are looking for startups that use artificial intelligence to assess risks in real time, combat fraud with predictive analytics or innovate in cybersecurity. We want Latin America to be a benchmark in digital trust,” he concluded. The call is open until April 21, 2025.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Merama raises US$215 million between equity and debt,https://contxto.com/en/funding/merama-raises-us215-million-between-equity-and-debt/,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 21:41:07 +0000","In the last year, Merama has focused on operational efficiency. Having worked with more than two dozen online retail brands, it now focuses on six. It has moved from being a centralized company to a more independent structure with a focus on fewer, but much larger and stronger brands, Olivier Scialom, COO of Merama, told Contxto. Investors agree with the change. “There is a cap table backing that we have inside Merama,” assures Felipe Delgado, CFO and president of Merama. Today it is receiving $45 million dollars in equity from investors that had already trusted the startup such as Advent International, SoftBank, Monashees, Valor Capital and Balderton Capital. In addition, they are adding a new investor: Marcel Telles, founder of the Brazilian fund 3G Capital. Merama is also raising $170 million in debt financing, led by BTG Pactual, Citi and Itaú. In one year Merama has raised $250 million dollars in debt, as it closed an $80 million dollar financing from J.P. Morgan in April 2024. The startup — which operates in Mexico and Brazil — reached unicorn status in 2021 with a valuation of $1.2 billion, after this investment the new valuation was not disclosed, but Delgado assures that it is still higher than $1 billion. In five years Merama has raised more than US$520 million in venture capital and debt. With the newly raised capital, Merama seeks to optimize the management of its brands and enable strategic expansions, including acquisitions within the segments in which it already operates. Merama’s executives claim that it is now a holding company for brands in the aforementioned industries, rather than an e-commerce aggregator, as it started in 2020 with a model similar to that of Thrasio, the industry leader that filed for bankruptcy in March last year in the United States. In the last 18 months, the startup has focused on selling assets in certain categories where it no longer wants to participate, Delgado explained. Merama’s portfolio and growth Among acquisitions, Merama reported the acquisition of Growth Supplements in Brazil, the largest sports nutrition company in Latin America and the fourth largest worldwide with annual sales in excess of US$400 million. It started the alliance with Growth Supplements three years ago, but is now being fully acquired. Delgado boasted that the company has grown more than 10X in this period. Growth Supplements offers nutritional supplements, with a broad portfolio that includes proteins, vitamins, sportswear and content focused on health and wellness. The goal is to increase the number of items, production, logistics capabilities, and explore a possible international expansion in the near future. By expanding into Mexico, it would be entering a dietary supplement industry that reaches more than 15 million consumers who purchase items through different channels such as e-commerce, according to the National Association of the Dietary Supplement Industry (ANAISA). Merama’s portfolio now includes six brands: Growth Supplements, Mercadazo (omnichannel e-commerce), Oceane (beauty), and three others in the furniture, kitchen and home and baby products industry. In 2024, Merama grew 30% in sales; 10% less than the growth reported in 2023. Delgado explained that from 2025 Merama’s growth will no longer be reported globally and will be divided by brand, as each grows at a different rate. With the capital received, they will invest “primarily in working capital and brand positioning” for each of their units. In the industries they are in, Delgado says they will still be doing M&A. “But the M&A is going to be below each platform or each business unit,” he said, clarifying that they are not considering entering another category in which they do not currently play.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Google for Startups Accelerator will boost Latin American startups that are implementing AI to protect biodiversity,https://contxto.com/en/aceleracion/google-for-startups-accelerator-will-boost-latin-american-startups-that-are-implementing-ai-to-protect-biodiversity/,"Wed, 02 Apr 2025 20:46:40 +0000","In a context marked by the loss of 73% of mammal, bird, fish, reptile and amphibian populations since 1970, and with 55% of global GDP at risk from environmental degradation, technological innovation plays a key role in solving some of the most pressing challenges facing the planet today. Despite environmental drawbacks that still need to be overcome, democratization of cutting-edge technologies such as AI represents an opportunity to address diverse challenges, and has already established itself as a revolutionary tool to help combat global ecological challenges through scalable projects and solutions. However, many of the startups that address these types of issues are left with little promise due to lack of support to consolidate and scale their solutions, so the backing of technology companies makes a difference. To boost startups working to make a positive impact on nature, Google has launched a key initiative: the Google for Startups Accelerator: IA for Nature. This hybrid, no-cost program is aimed at Latin American and North American (U.S. and Canada) startups that use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to protect, monitor and restore ecosystems. The acceleration program, which starts in May 2025 and runs for 10 weeks, combines virtual and face-to-face sessions to address critical technical challenges. Selected startups work on intensive projects (sprints) and receive one-on-one mentoring from Google engineers and sustainability experts. They also participate in workshops on product design, customer acquisition and leadership, culminating in a Demo Day in August 2025, where they present their progress to investors and industry leaders. In a blog post shared with Contxto, Paco Solsona, Google for Startups Accelerator Leader for Latin America at Google, mentions, “The program aims to drive the growth of startups using AI through mentorship with experts and access to Google technology that will enable them to launch solutions that help protect, manage and restore the biodiversity of the Americas.” “We believe that the vision of today’s entrepreneurs can make a big difference, which is why we launched Google for Startups Accelerator: AI for Nature,” he said. According to Solsona, this is the first program of its kind in the region. Benefits that transcend the economic Unlike other programs, this accelerator does not require the transfer of shares, which makes it attractive for early-stage startups. Participants receive up to $350,000 dollars in Google Cloud credits, essential for developing AI models, and 30 days of free access to tensor processing units (TPU) for open source ML research. But the value is not limited to just financial. Access to a global network of mentors, including Google DeepMind scientists and sustainability leaders, enables startups to refine their technical and business strategies. For example, the program connects teams with UX design experts and cloud solution architects, facilitating the integration of advanced technologies into their products. To be eligible, startups must operate between Seed and Series A stages, demonstrate market traction, and have a technically robust product that uses AI/ML in environmental areas. Priority is given to innovative solutions, such as the use of camera traps to monitor species or predictive algorithms to optimize reforestation. A key requirement is the commitment of the technical team, especially the CTO, who must actively participate in all sessions. This ensures that mentoring translates into concrete progress. In addition, geographic and thematic diversity is valued, looking for projects that address everything from bioeconomy in the Amazon to regenerative agriculture in Mexico. An expanded support ecosystem This accelerator does not operate in isolation. It is part of a global Google initiative that includes a $3 million dollar fund for Brazilian NGOs focused on protecting 30% of terrestrial and marine ecosystems by 2030, as well as the SpeciesNet AI model, recently released as open source to identify species in camera trap images. These tools complement the work of the startups, providing a technology and data framework to amplify their impact. With applications closing on March 31, 2025, the program represents a window for entrepreneurs looking to scale technical solutions with environmental impact. Interested startups must prepare detailed documentation about their technology, traction and equipment, and submit it through the official portal. In a world where technology and sustainability are interdependent pillars, the Google for Startups Accelerator: AI for Nature emerges as an essential bridge. It not only offers technical and financial resources, but builds an ecosystem where environmental innovation is nurtured by global collaboration. For startups willing to lead this change, the program is an unprecedented opportunity to transform data into action and algorithms into conservation.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Mexico’s Mutuus gets $3.2 million to grow its digital health membership,https://contxto.com/en/news/mexicos-mutuus-gets-3-2-million-to-grow-its-digital-health-membership/,"Tue, 01 Apr 2025 17:53:09 +0000","Mutuus, a startup founded in Mexico in 2017, is attempting to transform private healthcare memberships by making them affordable through an artificial intelligence-powered platform that removes financial and administrative barriers to accessing medical services. Its business model was attractive to venture capitalists who injected a $3.2 million dollars in investment. The round was led by Amador and counted with the participation of Latin Leap, Tantauco Ventures, Preface Ventures, Cuesta Partners and G2 Momentum Capital. Jean-Louis Brunet, founder and CEO, told Contxto that this is the first round of institutional investors that Mutuus has received, as it had previously been funded with resources from friends and family. At the moment Mutuus only operates in Mexico, but Brunet said he plans to expand the business model to other Latin American countries, which is one of the objectives he is seeking to achieve with the investment received. Mutuus enters the healthtech segment, which in Latin America last year received only 4% of total venture capital for startups, according to a study by Endeavor and Glisco Partners on the investment landscape in the region. In early stages, such as Mutuus, health and wellness technology startups receive 14.2% of venture capital investment, surpassing other segments such as fintech (which receives 13.4%) and e-commerce (which receives 7.1%), although surpassed by internet and AI technology startups (which capture 31.5%). Present and future of Muttus Mutuus brings high-quality medical services to underserved individuals and businesses through B2C and B2B channels. Mutuus currently serves more than 13,000 members, has managed the payment of more than 4,000 hospital bills across a network of more than 300 hospitals, and has helped families preserve more than $25 million in personal wealth through affordable healthcare solutions. Membership users receive no-deductible hospital coverage, telemedicine and significant discounts on in-person medical services, ensuring that businesses, SMEs and individuals can access private healthcare without financial stress. Brunet says that, in addition to geographic expansion, with this capital injection, Mutuus will enhance its AI-driven platform, optimizing emergency services, appointment scheduling, claims management and more, expand its B2B model and strengthen its partnerships with private hospitals. By the close of 2025, Brunet said, the goal is to close with 30,000 active members and net revenue of $18 million dollars.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670

Frubana expands line of credit for retailers via alliance with Accion and MasterCard,https://contxto.com/en/venture-capital-es/frubana-expands-line-of-credit-for-retailers-via-alliance-with-accion-and-mastercard/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 15:16:46 +0000","Frubana, the startup that functions as a marketplace for local food producers, has partnered with Accion and Mastercard to provide embedded financing solutions to retailers. The partnership will provide credit to more than 200,000 micro and small businesses, helping them meet their working capital needs and increase their financial capacity. Frubana uses an alternative credit scoring system based on machine learning to accelerate the farm-to-table process for disadvantaged restaurateurs and their small-scale suppliers, including farmer cooperatives. Originally operating in Colombia, Mexico and Brazil, since 2024, the company has solely focused on the Brazilian market, where access to working capital is one of the biggest pain points for local restaurateurs and the companies that supply them. Small-scale agriculture accounts for 77% of Brazil’s agricultural production, and more than 2.5 million small restaurants and food establishments source fruits, vegetables, meat and other products. The startup — which was incubated at Y Combinator in 2019 — connects small restaurant owners with farmers, food processors and manufacturers, providing them with access to supplies, software and responsible credit. According to the company, this helps reduce operating costs, accelerate market transactions and increase revenue in an industry where many operators are unable to build a credit history. The need for this new line of credit arises precisely from that quest to enter a formal banking system, something that has been denied mainly to small merchants: “Small restaurants in Brazil’s food sector are largely invisible to the financial system,” explained Juan Pablo Garcia, director of Frubana. “Lenders often perceive them as high-risk customers due to their irregular cash flow and insufficient formal financial records. We seek to develop better payment and credit solutions for these small entrepreneurs to help them access credit that can drive the growth of their business,” said García. Technology to provide personalized credit Leveraging machine learning tools, Accion and Frubana developed a new algorithm based on alternative data attributes and its ability to predict the creditworthiness of entrepreneurs. So far, Frubana has already issued 80,000 loans to date, is approving 8 out of 10 credit applications, and one-third of approved loans are being disbursed to customers new to credit and new to business. Meanwhile, the portfolio delinquency issue has been outstanding; nonaccrual loans are below the company’s expectations. “Local restaurants and food-producing businesses, particularly those owned by women, have long been unable to access credit due to high costs and complicated credit application processes,” said Jonathan Blanco, Accion’s Senior Director of Digital Lending. Frubana operates as a B2B online marketplace with a mission to become the “one-stop shop” for Latin America’s $100 billion food industry. Through technology, it provides small and medium-sized restaurants with convenient access to all the product categories needed to run their businesses. Finally, the partnership between Accion and the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth is signed for 8 years, and aims to help 23 million people in 25 countries benefit from the digital economy through a variety of programs.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670

In total, Strike has raised $19.3 million. The startup, founded in 2022 in Uruguay, specializes in continuous pentesting, a method that simulates a computer attack on a system, network or application to avoid vulnerabilities. Strike currently has offices in Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil and the United States and its clients include Hitachi Vantara, Farmacias del Ahorro, Telefónica, Santander and Clip. Santiago Rosenblatt, CEO and founder of Strike, told Contxto that since its launch in 2022, the startup has tripled its growth and plans to maintain that growth rate this year. The newly raised capital will serve to fuel its growth and accelerate the development of its products, especially an AI-driven, automated security testing engine, from discovery to vulnerability remediation. Automating cybersecurity Strike aims to automate 50% of the pentesting process by the end of 2025, to get security teams to identify and fix vulnerabilities faster and more efficiently. “Companies are investing millions in security, but attackers are still finding vulnerabilities before they can react (…). Our AI-powered platform will take vulnerability detection and remediation to an unprecedented level,” commented Rosenblatt. Strike seeks to change the traditional pentesting process that is often slow, costly and reactive, as reports can take months to be delivered, leaving companies exposed. The startup has a team that combines world-class ethical hackers with AI-based automation to detect, challenge and fix security breaches before attackers can exploit them. With the invested capital Strike also wants to continue its accelerated growth in Mexico, a country where it has consolidated a robust local team and where it is looking to expand its operations to meet the growing demand for automated security testing. Rosenblatt shared that the goal in 2025 is to surpass eight figures in annual recurring revenue, automate pentesting at scale and consolidate Strike as the market leader in continuous AI-driven security testing.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Brazil’s Bankuish took first place at ‘4YFN Awards’,https://contxto.com/en/brazil/brazils-bankuish-took-first-place-at-4yfn-awards/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 14:47:43 +0000","The good times for Latin American fintechs are not only attracting the attention of investors looking for opportunities in the region. Entrepreneurs in this industry who decide to cross borders in search of opportunities are demonstrating that the potential of fintechs in the Americas can also have a global impact. The Brazilian startup Bankuish is proof of this. The fintech that provides access to credit for gig economy workers (working on their own or for platforms), was selected as the winner of the 4YFN Awards competition at Mobible World Congress MWC 2025 in Barcelona, Spain. During the final of the competition, Bankuish beat the other four finalist startups from the United Kingdom, Spain, Israel and the United States. Its founder and CEO, José Vicente Fernandez, captivated the audience and the jury with his five-minute pitch in which he demonstrated how his solution is improving the lives of thousands of people performing specific tasks under the gig economy, which refers to sporadic or on-demand jobs, something quite common in the model of companies like Rappi, Uber, among many others. Fintech is challenging traditional banking models with a more inclusive financial assessment. In an interview with 4YFN, Fernández, who graduated as an economist and worked as a credit risk expert in European banks, explained that his own experience allowed him to understand both the challenges and opportunities to make finance more inclusive. Bankuish seeks to break the vicious cycle that prevents the self-employed from accessing loans. Through a mobile app, workers can connect their accounts from various platforms such as Uber, Rappi, Didi and many more, to generate their own free credit report. Based on the score, financial institutions will send credit offers that automatically appear in the app. The platform also incorporates an AI-powered assistant that allows discovering ways to improve the score, such as taking mini courses or other tips. This motivates the user to unlock opportunities for offers. After standing out among the five finalists, the Brazilian startup won a prize of 20,000 euros awarded by the GSMA Foundry, and took the title as the winner of the 4YFN25 Awards. The jury was composed of experts from the investment sector, while the audience was made up of industry professionals, entrepreneurs, institutional representatives and the general public. 4YFN (Four Years From Now) is a competition of great importance within the startup ecosystem, boosting hundreds of promising companies from all over the world through connections, exposure and investment. Startups receive critical support early in their lifecycle and throughout their entire journey. “By 2028, our goal is to be the credit agency of choice for most major banks when assessing the creditworthiness of the future of work. We currently serve the largest banks in LATAM, and are being successfully adopted in the U.S. We wish to serve most of the world’s major banks and insurance providers by 2028,” said Jose Fernandez, founder and CEO of Bankuish in an interview for the 4YFN blog. A growing sector Reports in recent years have evidenced and reaffirmed the importance of fintech as an engine to drive Latin America’s economy. Due to the high rates of financial exclusion in the region, the companies that are transforming the sector have become the epicenter of the biggest technological disruption of the last decade, and there is a clear reason that goes far beyond a trend: the need for a structural transformation of traditional banking focused on solving real problems of the Latin American population. Bankuish’s success in competing against startups from all over the world that are driving great innovations through technology is proof of the transformative power of fintechs in our region.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670

This brings the round to a total of US$366 million and makes it one of the largest in the last three years in Latin America. The company was valued at $2.75 billion in the first part of the Series E, which was led by Allianz X, the venture arm of German insurer Allianz SE. In an interview with Bloomberg, founder and CEO Pierpaolo Barbieri said the funds raised through the share sale will be used to continue growing in Latin America, with a special focus on Mexico. In a meeting with media in Mexico at the end of 2024, Barbieri spoke of the opportunity that this country represents, as 45% of its users in Mexico had not had a credit card before and boasted that it is acquiring 100,000 monthly users (they have 1.7 million users in the country), the business in Mexico is growing 15% monthly. In addition, Barbieri assured that after one year operating with a banking license in Mexico, Ualá has multiplied by 5 the number of users and the active portfolio. He also said that they will soon be offering loans for SMEs. Two of its recent services are: payroll portability (which already has tens of thousands of clients) and remittances (which is growing 15% per month). An important ally Having TelevisaUnivision as an ally, Barbieri told Bloomberg, will help them build trust and closeness with Mexicans who are not yet familiar with their offering. Although the focus is on Mexico, Barbieri also stated that it will continue to bet on the payments, investment and credit ecosystem in Argentina, as it is still the country with the largest number of users of its three markets (it also operates in Colombia). Of its 9 million customers across the region, 6.5 million are in its native Argentina. Launched in 2017 with its core debit card product, Ualá now offers a range of options including payments, credit, merchant acquiring and investments, with services dependent on each country. Barbieri said in November 2024 that Ualá is already profitable in Argentina after seven years operating and would reach profitability in Mexico around 2026.

Central American youth to receive free AI training,https://contxto.com/en/central-america/central-american-youth-to-receive-free-ai-training/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 17:59:32 +0000","To boost employability and digital entrepreneurship in Central America, the Central American Parliament (PARLACEN) and the Digital University of Artificial Intelligence (UDIA) have created an alliance that aims to bring multiple benefits to the region. Thousands of young Central Americans will have the opportunity to receive free and certified training in artificial intelligence (AI) in a strategy to eliminate the gap in access to knowledge in this branch of technology that is advancing by leaps and bounds. The initiative will enable program members to study 100% online and also receive training in process automation and advanced AI tools, thus boosting employability and improving opportunities for all involved. In the region, Costa Rica is one of the countries that is leading the adoption of AI, expressing its intention to establish a National Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (LaNIA) specifically aimed at finding cross-sectoral solutions with AI support for national problems. Its objectives are to create an ecosystem, strengthen trust, and promote AI research and education. Recently the World Bank approved financing for about $200 million dollars, a bet to transform education in Costa Rica, with the aim of reducing the digital divide, training students in different areas of technology where artificial intelligence is undoubtedly also a protagonist. Promoting this type of technology is fundamental for the development of many of the countries in Central America, because it is a commitment to educate youth in an industry that has a greater economic projection in the short and medium term and where it is estimated that its global market value could exceed the barrier of $300,000 million dollars by 2026. “Central America is a land of opportunities, of resilience, of entrepreneurial spirit. But above all, it is a region with an exciting youth that deserves access to the tools needed to build tomorrow,” said Anas Andaloussi, CEO of UDIA, in a statement. According to a report by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Panama has also stated in interviews with the OECD that its government has already begun exploratory talks about a national approach to AI, although strategies are not yet formally planned. “When we bet on digital education, when we bring technology to those who need it most, we are making real policy. Politics that tells a young person in Guatemala, in El Salvador, in Honduras, in Panama, in Nicaragua, in the Dominican Republic that their future is not determined by their limitations, but by the opportunities we offer them,” said Andaloussi. McKinsey estimates that Generative AI could contribute between $20 billion and $30 billion annually to the Central American and Caribbean economy by 2030, impacting industries such as financial services, agriculture, among others, and bringing multiple opportunities to the region. However, it also presents specific challenges and risks that regional leaders will need to address, the report says. The signing of the agreement, which was attended by deputies from the different benches and representatives of the six member countries [Dominican Republic is also a PARLACEN member nation], will have an initial term of three years with the possibility of extension, monitoring and evaluation to measure its impact on the training and labor development of the young beneficiaries. “The agreement we signed between the Central American Parliament and UDIA is a commitment to this vision: to provide young Central Americans with the knowledge and skills in artificial intelligence that will allow them to be protagonists in the global digital transformation,” concluded Andaloussi.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Mexican funds Nazca and Bridge Latam merge into one venture capital firm,https://contxto.com/en/venture-capital-es/mexican-funds-nazca-and-bridge-latam-merge-into-one-venture-capital-firm/,"Fri, 21 Mar 2025 19:52:21 +0000","Mexican venture capital funds Nazca and Bridge are merging to form a single firm, whose name is not yet defined, according to Luis Enriquez, partner and co-founder of Bridge. This transaction is the first of its kind in the Latin American investment ecosystem. The collaboration between Nazca and Bridge Latam began three years ago with the launch of Nazca III, a fund that, in addition to its core strategy, allocated a portion of its capital to invest in emerging managers to foster strategic alliances in the region. Now after the merger, Nazca Fund IV will be launched in 2025 with the ambition to lead the investment ecosystem in Latin America. “We are yet to define the size, but we are looking to lead the Spanish speaking Latam region,” Enriquez told Contxto. VC consolidation Hector Sepulveda, co-founder and managing partner of Nazca, said in a statement, “By combining the strengths of Nazca and Bridge, we are creating a powerhouse that will shape the future of the startup ecosystem in the region.” Throughout its trajectory – which began in 2013 in Mexico City – Nazca has backed some of the most relevant startups in the region, including Kavak, Z Brands (Luuna), Ben & Frank, Albo and Jüsto. While Bridge, founded in 2022 by angel investors, has bet on growth companies such as Aplazo, Mendel, Koywe and Niko, demonstrating the effectiveness of its early-stage investment model. Nazca has managed more than $300 million dollars in assets and has obtained returns in excess of 30% IRR in its first fund. Bridge, on the other hand, has consolidated a data-driven investment approach that has proven to generate significantly superior early-stage returns. The merger will integrate the managing partners of both funds and its thesis will be “to invest in early-stage, industry-agnostic tech companies with great entrepreneurs,” said Enriquez. In addition, the new merged structure will have the backing of recognized local, regional and international institutional investors. This union will allow the integration of two large networks of venture partners, formed by some of the most influential entrepreneurs and founders in Latin America, among which stand out: Daniel Vogel (Bitso), Liza Schwartzman (Fitpass), Eduardo Paulsen (Ben & Frank), Javier Mata (Yalo), Federico Ranero (Draiver), Alejandro Maza (OPI), Miguel Garcia (Infosel) and Alison Campbell (Zubale), on Bridge’s side. On Nazca’s side, the network includes Carlos García (Kavak), Carlos Salinas (Z Brands) and Ricardo Weder (Jüsto). The merger will also bring new technological capabilities. Bridge will leverage its proprietary predictive algorithms, in collaboration with Nazca’s Artificial Intelligence unit, to improve data-driven decision making. It is worth noting that Bridge is the only Latin American VC that is part of the global Data-Driven VC network, showing leadership in the application of artificial intelligence to venture capital. Both firms believe that mergers between venture capital funds are beginning to play a key role in the expansion and consolidation of the sector.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Mexico’s WAS Co. reaches $10 million valuation after pre-seed round,https://contxto.com/en/funding/mexicos-was-co-reaches-10-million-valuation-after-pre-seed-round/,"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 18:47:27 +0000","WAS Co, a startup that produces sustainable materials for the construction industry, raised $1.5 million dollars in a pre-seed investment round, mainly from angel investors, reaching a valuation of $10 million dollars. The startup, originally from Mexico, was founded in 2019 when Walter Mata, CEO of WAS Co., graduated from the University of Monterrey (UdeM). The founding team consisted of Fabián Rodríguez and Pablo Castaño. At the beginning they started using recycled plastic to manufacture formwork (a type of concrete container). From the beginning, the founding team’s concern was to reduce the environmental impact of the construction industry, which is one of the biggest polluters in Monterrey. Although they have experimented with different materials, the main objective has always been to replace traditional cement and concrete with one with less environmental and health impact. So they began working to develop and design a cement and concrete substitute with the help of the cement company Holcim through its Global Acceleration program. Over the years, they have succeeded in creating zero-emission cements and concretes from mining waste, since the mining industry generates waste all over the world, which WAS Co. uses to transform it into zero-emission construction materials. In 2024, WAS Co. generated sales of $200,000 dollars and the projection for 2025 is between $500,000 and US$1 million dollars. Its annual growth was 1.5 times. Walter Mata – who was recognized in 2022 as Inventor of the Year by the MIT Innovators Under 35 Awards – estimates that in the third quarter of 2025 he will raise another $15 million dollars for his seed round. With the money raised, they are looking to build a plant to manufacture their products. The pilot plans to manufacture 5 to 10 tons per month, according to a document shared by its CEO to Contxto. For now they have five technologies they are looking to patent. According to said document, the opportunity for this type of materials in Mexico is more than 160 million tons with a value of $150 dollars per ton; a target market of $16 billion dollars. This could reach $144 billion dollars if the United States and Canada are considered. Positioning of the contech WAS Co. enters the contech (construction technology) and cleantech (clean technologies) ecosystem, a sector that is gaining relevance within venture capital, but which has not always been among the most invested. According to an analysis published by Cemex Ventures, in 2024 in the world, 3.1 billion dollars were invested in contech startups and there were 325 agreements, 90 more than in 2023, although the amount invested remained static. Around the world, there are already several efforts to decarbonize the manufacture of building materials. In the United States, startups such as C-Crete and Sublime Systems, backed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), are already doing so. And in Mexico, Cemex, through its venture capital arm, has collaborated with startups around the world to innovate in this area. Also, in 2023, Holcim launched a product that promises 50% less carbon emissions.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
"Eventsost, the sustainable certification platform for events, announces expansion into Mexico",https://contxto.com/en/mexico/eventsost-the-sustainable-certification-platform-for-events-announces-expansion-into-mexico/,"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 16:12:13 +0000","Eventsost, a sustainable management certification system for the events industry, announces its expansion into Mexico. The platform was founded in 2014 by Alberto Gómez in Madrid, and since then accompanies and advises companies, organizers and decision makers to adopt more sustainable strategies for event production. With its arrival in Mexico, the goal is to create a community of companies in the MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions) industry, committed to both environmental and social sustainability. “Mexico is one of the main destinations for festivals and concerts, and is also the fifth key player in Latin America in the congress, corporate and sporting events industry,” explained Alberto Gómez, founder and CEO of Eventsost. According to data from the company, in the next two years they expect to implement their certification, with the help of their technological tools that allow them to measure their impact and optimize their resources, to more than 40 leading and top-level companies in the industry. “There is a key opportunity in the implementation of sustainable practices as a competitive differentiator. Sustainability actions can strengthen the leadership of Mexican companies and attract more investment and motivate other countries in the region to adopt similar strategies,” says Gómez. Events as a source of pollution Despite the growing concern for sustainability in the entertainment industry, the environmental impact of festivals is still a poorly documented issue in Mexico. Data from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) reveal that a person generates an average of 854 grams of garbage per day, which in an event with 90,000 attendees could translate into approximately 77 tons of solid waste. Hence, the company’s solution is to offer certifications for the improvement of sustainability throughout the entire event management cycle; provide specialized consultants to verify responsible practices in festivals and companies; and a technological platform that uses AI to advise and personalize learning for event organizers, while allowing them to see in real time how to reduce their carbon footprint based on planning decisions they make ahead of events. Attendee transportation, waste production, energy consumption and water impact are some of the main contributors to the carbon footprint and environmental impact of mass events. Among the solutions are transportation logistics plans, use of compostable materials, use of biodiesel or renewable energies; among a wide range of other actions. “The current success of events is not limited to attendance or visual impact, attendees increasingly value their ability to reduce their environmental footprint on the environment and the community and it becomes a key reason to feel more in order of a brand or musical event. It is key to implement sustainable practices that make it stand out as a competitive differentiator,” emphasized Gómez. Over 10 years, the platform has certified more than 135 events such as Granca Live Fest 2024 and 40 organizations including hotels, venues, catering, agencies and other actors in the convention, conference and business tourism sector in Europe and Chile, including events of companies such as Google, Siemens, Mastercard, Sony, BBVA, among others.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
"“Our goal is to prevent blindness through early detection with AI,” Cristina Campero, CEO of PROSPERiA",https://contxto.com/en/healthtech/our-goal-is-to-prevent-blindness-through-early-detection-with-ai-cristina-campero-ceo-of-prosperia/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 16:33:31 +0000","Among the sectors most benefiting from advances in artificial intelligence is healthcare. From drug discovery to the optimization of time and resources in the diagnosis of various pathologies, new AI solutions are transforming the sector and the global healthcare AI market is expected to exceed $187 billion dollars by 2030. In Latin America, this technology could drive a transformation. Since early diagnosis is the key to avoiding serious or irreversible illness, the lack of preventive measures threatens the health of millions of people. Mexican startup PROSPERiA was founded in 2020 with the mission of creating cutting-edge technological solutions to make healthcare more accessible. In an interview with Contxto, Cristina Campero, CEO of PROSPERiA, highlighted the importance of working in the sector and generating a direct impact on people’s health and quality of life. Several years after starting her career as a consultant at McKinsey, where she was able to learn about various industries including healthcare, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, Campero decided to start a company with her cousin, Alejandro Noriega, who was finishing his PhD in artificial intelligence at MIT. The two were aligned on creating something primarily to improve access to diagnostics and treatments. Their main product is currently retinIA, a platform developed to help prevent blindness. The platform is powered by artificial intelligence to perform automatic analysis of retinal images. Thanks to the efficiency of this technology, retinIA can issue personalized and timely recommendations to both patients and physicians. “We decided to start with diabetic retinopathy because it is particularly a very big problem in Mexico, a country with the highest prevalence of diabetes in the world, and because our healthcare system, the public one, is inefficient, while the private one is very fragmented and expensive,” explained the CEO. “It’s a huge problem that technologically was a good starting point.” Mexico is one of the countries with the highest prevalence of diabetes in the world, and if not properly controlled can lead to serious complications such as diabetic retinopathy. This condition, which damages the blood vessels of the retina, is one of the main causes of blindness in adults. Early detection can prevent vision loss. Technology as a tool for more accessible health The platform developed by Campero and her team uses artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze retinal images and detect early signs of diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataracts, pathological myopia, macular edema and more. The process is simple: a photo of the retina is taken with a special camera, uploaded to the platform, and algorithms analyze the image to identify potential problems. “Our goal is to prevent blindness through early detection. We take a picture of the retina, analyze it with artificial intelligence, and if we find anything suspicious we recommend the patient to visit an ophthalmologist for proper diagnosis and treatment,” Campero explains. Although technology offers promising solutions, innovating in the healthcare sector is not without its challenges. One of the biggest obstacles PROSPERiA faced was the lack of clear regulations in Mexico for medical software. “When we started there was no clear regulation for medical software in Mexico. That was a problem because we did not have a defined path, but also an advantage because it allowed us to position our solution as a screening tool, not as a definitive diagnosis,” commented Campero. Improving the accuracy of the algorithms for the Mexican population was another important challenge. “The first algorithm we designed was based on a public database with images of patients from several countries. Although it allowed us to launch an MVP, we knew we needed to improve the accuracy for our population,” she added. To date, the platform has evaluated more than 95,000 patients, detecting retinal problems in 16,000 of them. These findings have enabled many people to receive early treatment, preventing serious complications and even blindness. “The most important thing is that we are helping patients who didn’t know they had a problem. If they had not done the study, that lesion could have progressed and caused irreversible vision loss,” Campero emphasizes. Expansion and upcoming challenges Since its $2M seed investment in 2022 financed by the Swedish fund Cardo Health, focused on healthcare companies, the company has continued to improve its product and expand its operational capabilities. While currently focused on Mexico, Campero and her team do not rule out opportunities to expand into more Latin American countries and key markets such as the United States. However, they recognize that each market has its own regulations and challenges that must be resolved before making the leap. “In the United States, regulations are much clearer, but also more demanding. Also, the healthcare system is very different, with a focus on insurance and reimbursement. For now we continue with the objective of consolidating our operation in Mexico,” she explained. To conclude, Campero shared some valuable reflections for those who wish to enter the medical technology sector: “It is a roller coaster. There are very good moments, but also many challenges. The most important thing is to build a solid network of mentors, investors and other entrepreneurs. Don’t keep quiet about your idea; share it early on to get feedback and support.”",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
"Latin America, a leader in hiring demand for tech talent",https://contxto.com/en/america-latina/latin-america-a-leader-in-hiring-demand-for-tech-talent/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 01:02:11 +0000","The technology sector is an ever-growing market that attracts investment, and is projected to grow by approximately 11% in Latin America by 2024, according to research and consulting firm IDC. This opens up possibilities for both new talent and companies looking to attract new talent into their ranks. Among the advantages that make the region attractive for companies seeking talent is its proximity to the United States and similar time zones. This is reflected in a market that is transitioning from offshoring to nearshoring. From 2000 to 2023, the number of technology-based companies in Latin America increased from 558 to 33,489, representing a 60-fold growth. Thanks to this demand from technology companies, applications for some key positions in the industry, such as software developers, data engineers and AI/ML specialists, are expected to increase. Local players incentivizing hiring “The outlook is challenging but promising,” John Mendivelso, Slalom ‘s Director for Colombia, told Contxto. “Latin America is benefiting from the growing global demand for tech talent, especially with the rise of Allshore operating models, which allow companies to hire talent regardless of their geographic location.” Among the advantages that attract the eyes of large companies to the region is the young and talented population, with many professionals trained in computer science, software engineering and other IT-related areas. This is highlighted in the latest ‘State of Global Hiring Report 2024’ by Deel, which states that Generation Z is increasingly important for the labor market, registering an increase of 116 percent in hiring processes. Additionally, competitive costs, multilingual professionals, as well as attractive tax incentives for North American companies, are key to attracting recruiters. However, Mendivelso noted that there remain significant challenges. “One of the biggest challenges is the skills gap, as the pace of technological upgrades does not always match the training of local talent. In addition, the high demand for professionals with advanced English reduces the pool of available candidates.” English skills gap EF Education First recently published its EF English Proficiency Index, which revealed that Latin America continues to have the lowest proficiency levels in the language worldwide. For example, Colombia ranks 74th, among the lowest levels in the region. “We know that Spanish de facto opens economic opportunities with other countries that share the language, but English opens more geographic doors, plus we know that Mexico is not only interested in exchanging with Latin American countries,” said Mendivelso. Slalom has recently established a Global Technology Center in Colombia, with plans to employ 600 professionals by 2025. “Our goal is to combine local, national and global talent through our Allshore model,” Mendivelso explained. “This not only creates growth opportunities for Colombian professionals, but also contributes to raising industry standards in the country.” According to projections by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) it is estimated that by 2025, 1.2 million software developers will be employed, generating sales of more than $18.5 billion in Latin America. The study states that 31% of IT candidates consider that the most reliable option for job search are digital recruitment platforms. Followed by those who prefer job portals (22%). In addition, 21% of IT professionals changed companies in the last year, and the average length of employment was about 1.3 years. Slalom takes an inclusive approach to addressing inequality in access to education. “We offer technical and soft skills training programs, mentoring and coaching,” Mendivelso explained. “We also collaborate with educational institutions and nonprofit organizations to identify talent in disadvantaged communities.”",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Impact Ventures PSM and Impacta VC launch $5 million fund to invest in Latin American startups,https://contxto.com/en/venture-capital-es/impact-ventures-psm-and-impacta-vc-launch-5-million-fund-to-invest-in-latin-american-startups/,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 19:46:02 +0000","Mexican fund Impact Ventures PSM, Promotora Social Mexico‘s impact investment team, and Impacta VC, a Chilean social and environmental impact venture capital firm, launched a strategic alliance for the formation of a new fund called “Impact Ventures PSM Seed” for a value of US$5 million. The fund will be operated by Impacta VC and expects to invest in 20 Latin American startups in pre-seed and seed stages that generate social and/or environmental impact. The investment thesis includes sectors such as education, health, fair trade, ecosystem development, housing, financial inclusion, agtech and climatech. The priority will be startups with a technological component and a full-time committed founding team, betting on innovative, scalable and replicable business models that generate positive and sustainable change in society and the environment. “The main criteria we consider is the positive impact that the company can have in the region and in the world; that is to say that they can, thanks to their products or services, improve the quality of life of the most needy people,” Corinne Lebrun, Managing Partner of Impact Ventures PSM Seed told Contxto. “We also look for the team to be the right one and to be fully committed to providing the solution to the problem they have chosen to work on. We invest first and foremost in people who are aligned with our values and impact mission,” she added. With these criteria in mind, they will make investments of between $100,000 and $300,000 USD in the selected startups. Impact Ventures PSM has been investing in impact projects in Mexico for more than 15 years, with 31 total active investments in the portfolio: 21 direct investments in companies and 10 investments in funds. These investments come from 6 countries: Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Argentina, Brazil and the United States. Meanwhile, Impacta VC has built a portfolio of 11 startups in different countries in the region through its Fund I, of $6.6M USD. These include Betterfly, the first social unicorn in Latin America; Airbag, which fights one of the leading causes of death in the world; and Wheel the World, which drives global accessibility from the U.S. In addition, with three editions of its capital raising program, the Impacta Fundraising Strategy Program (IFSP), it has supported more than 350 startups from 14 Latin American countries. Strategic support In addition to the grants, the fund also provides a broad portfolio of connections and advice for the selected startups. “We consider ourselves true partners of the entrepreneurs and we seek to have a continuous collaboration adapted to each need. We have personalized mentoring programs, and we also make our network available, creating connections and a support network,” explains Lebrun. In this sense, the fund aims to solve a specific and clear problem in the region: the lack of pre-seed and seed capital, which is why this alliance was created to provide them with the financing, support and connections they need to scale. “The doors are open to build together a future with more opportunities and solutions that transform Latin America,” said David Alvo, CEO and Managing Partner of Impacta VC. Both organizations share the same vision: to drive innovative and sustainable solutions that transform realities in Latin America. “Entrepreneurship is a long and often lonely road, so having a support network makes a difference,” added Lebrun, who also emphasized the importance of understanding the difficulties faced by early-stage companies and being present to help them solve them. “We want entrepreneurs to have enough confidence with us to tell us when things are not going well and ask us for help, because they know we can provide them thanks to the large network of mentors we have in Latin America,” he said. Regarding social and environmental impact investment opportunities, Lebrun noted that Latin America presents unique challenges that, in turn, generate significant opportunities. “The more difficulties and challenges we have in the region, the more opportunities we see to invest in sectors that need disruption because we are not doing things right,” he explained. Among the most promising sectors, he mentioned education, health and basic services, highlighting the need to make them accessible to all. Finally, he emphasized the challenges of climate change. “We cannot forget about all the effects that climate change brings with it, especially for the most vulnerable population,” the investor concluded.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670

VEMO raises $63 million to expand electric mobility in Mexico,https://contxto.com/en/news/vemo-raises-63-million-to-expand-electric-mobility-in-mexico/,"Tue, 04 Mar 2025 18:36:08 +0000","Mexican electric mobility company VEMO raised around USD $63 million to expand its electric vehicle fleet and charging network. The investment round was led by Beel Credit, Banco Covalto, Kapital and Promecap Founded in 2021, VEMO offers end-to-end electric mobility solutions, including electric vehicle leasing, charging stations and fleet management. VEMO helps independent drivers transition from gasoline-powered vehicles to electric vehicles with a simple, comprehensive system that facilitates fleet electrification. The company has deployed more than 600 public charging points to date throughout Mexico and operates one of the largest electric vehicle transportation and last-mile delivery fleets in that country. With this investment, VEMO intends to expand its electric fleet, install more charging infrastructure and improve its fleet management technology. They also want to expand VEMO Impulso, their vehicle leasing program for passenger transport drivers with operations in Mexico. The program includes exclusive benefits such as access and preferential pricing at the more than 600 chargers of the VEMO Charging Network, the most robust and reliable public charging network in Mexico. These financing lines will allow VEMO Impulso to continue consolidating its position in leasing to drivers of mobility platforms, democratizing access to credit for thousands of drivers with an entrepreneurial spirit so they can build equity. “Our comprehensive model to form a clean mobility ecosystem allows us today to employ more than 2,000 people that we seek to contribute to a mobility decabonixation effort that benefits us with better user experiences and cleaner air in our cities,” Aaron Saenz, Director of VEMO Impulso, told Contxto. Currently, more than 3,500 independent drivers have financed their vehicles with VEMO Impulso and more than 50% opt for clean mobility solutions, driven by the experience of use and the economic advantages that this option offers. This model not only transforms the way they work, but also opens up opportunities for them to grow and professionalize in a constantly evolving sector. “We seek to accelerate the adoption of clean mobility technologies through an innovative and pioneering comprehensive solution that includes vehicles, charging infrastructure, technology and data intelligence for fleet management, as components that make up a clean mobility ecosystem,” adds Saenz. Siemens, Uber, Santander and BYD are some of the global leaders that VEMO has partnered with to help companies and drivers reduce fuel costs, lower emissions and accelerate the use of electric transportation in Mexico. In February 2024, the company also closed a strategic round of capital with Orion Infrastructure Partners (OIC), who joined Riverstone Holdings as the second U.S. fund specializing in sustainable infrastructure to invest in the Mexican company.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Unicorns in Latin America 2025: how the race to conquer the $1 billion mark is going,https://contxto.com/en/venture-capital/unicorns-in-latin-america-2025-how-the-race-to-conquer-the-1-billion-mark-is-going/,"Thu, 27 Feb 2025 16:54:56 +0000","We recently learned how 2024 marked a recovery in venture capital funding figures for Latin American startups. Overall, funding in Latin American startups reached $4.2 billion, including all stages. At this rate, it is expected that by 2025 we will see the emergence of at least three unicorns. The latest report from Wayra, the corporate venture arm of Spanish telecommunications firm Telefónica, revealed that given the conditions in Latin America, three new unicorns could be born. Despite the economic instability that could impact the availability of capital, the report cites that Brazil will see the emergence of a new startup valued at $1 billion, namely Ambar, a construtech, and the AI process management platform Pipefy. Likewise, other countries such as Mexico could also see the birth of a unicorn. Bright, the company that finances solar energy, and the logistics startup 99 Minutos are some of the candidates. The Argentine marketplace Agrofy, the Colombian proptech La Haus also join the race. Fintechs lead the race Fintechs are emerging as one of the most attractive sectors for investors, being a bastion for local entrepreneurship. In the last quarter of 2024, Argentine fintech Ualá closed the year with a $300 million Series E round; while Brazil’s Asaas raised $148 million in its Series C. While sectors such as fintech and SaaS have advantages in terms of scalability thanks to their technological models, at the same time they face high competition and a growing demand for specialized talent. The outlook for unicorns While there are different opportunities in sight, some experts talk about what can be considered an economic instability of local entrepreneurship, something that could negatively impact the availability of capital from investors. Latin America is facing a scenario of a devalued market, especially due to the situation that depends on other economies, such as the US. This represents an additional obstacle compared to other continents. Firstly, startups in the region face not only local competition, but also seek to overcome the challenge of reaching another market and expanding in Latin America. Adapting to the micro-economies represented by each country adds up to major challenges. On the other hand, according to a report by the venture capital firm Cube Ventures, 85% of the latest transactions in the region show values below $250 million dollars and only 4% of these movements exceed $1 billion. The advantage is that startups in the region are able to operate in complete environments and adapt quickly to complex capital raising situations, seeking alternatives to identify opportunities in adverse scenarios. According to a recent report by the firm Distrito, 12 Latin American startups are emerging as the most promising to achieve it this year, here we present them. The 12 startups that could reach a valuation of 1 billion by 2025 Argentina RecargaPay: Mobile payment platform that allows recharging credit, paying for services and managing transportation. With more than 7 million users, it has grown organically in recent years. Pomelo: Fintech that offers infrastructure for issuing and managing cards in the cloud. Its model has made it a strategic ally for banks and fintechs in Latin America. Mexico Kueski: fintech that has revolutionized access to personal credit in Mexico with its “buy now, paylater” model. It has granted more than 20 million loans and works with 25% of the main retailers in the country, which positions it as a strong unicorn candidate. Brazil Tractian: develops industrial predictive maintenance solutions through intelligent sensors and specialized software. Blip: chatbot platform powered by artificial intelligence that optimizes digital business communication. Operates in 32 countries and continues to expand in key markets. Petlove: marketplace for pet products, with more than 15 million items available. Its subscription model has built a loyal and growing customer base. Mottu: motorcycle rental service for independent delivery drivers, including insurance and 24/7 assistance. CRM&Bonus: loyalty platform that uses giftback technology to measure and optimize the impact of commercial incentives. Flash: corporate benefits system that offers flexibility and personalization. It has more than 30,000 clients and one million users. Stark Bank: fintech specializing in digital banking solutions for medium and large companies. Its capacity for integration and expansion has attracted the attention of investors. Omie: cloud platform for business management, aimed at SMEs, that combines financial services with automation.

The capital injection, which will be fundamental to boost the startup’s growth in Latin America, was led by Magma Partners, iThink VC, Semilla Ventures and other angels. The startup was founded in Lima, Peru. This investment comes at a crucial time in the evolution of e-commerce in Latin America. According to Statista, the e-commerce market in the region is expected to grow significantly through 2025, with social commerce emerging as a key driver. With the money raised in this round, the company will invest in the development of a new model that will have the capacity to serve the business, facilitating the setup of virtual sellers and streamlining internal administration. In addition, new offices will be opened in Mexico to reinforce local presence, and capital will be allocated to expand commerce integrations and strengthen analytical capabilities. The startup is on its way to consolidate its position as an integral solution for brands seeking to scale sales through conversational channels in Latin America. YaVendió is an AI-powered virtual sales assistant designed to boost e-commerce business sales through platforms such as WhatsApp and social networks. The platform automates interactions with customers, offering 24/7 support to answer queries and facilitate purchases, thus improving sales conversions and customer engagement. “Unlike other solutions that basically just offer you a platform to order your customers and let you do all the work manually; Yavendió provides you with artificial intelligence agents specialized in retail,” David Tafur, CEO of Yavendió, told Contxto. The technology integrated by this startup enables the creation of highly specialized virtual AI agents for retail capable of conversing with customers, recommending among hundreds of products, managing payments and even coordinating deliveries, all without human intervention. In the last year, Yavendió has enabled an intelligent sales channel for more than 100 fashion, footwear, beauty and home goods retailers in Mexico and Peru, and has doubled its business in the last six months thanks to the high adoption of its platform by brands seeking sales solutions via whatsapp and other social networks. “We invested in Yavendió because they are experts in e-commerce. They have understood that this sector has very specific needs, and their WhatsApp product is much more than a generic chatbot, automating the entire sales process in a unique way,” Nathan Lustig, Managing Partner at Magma Partners, said in a statement. According to a study, during the third quarter of 2023, WhatsApp was the most used social network in Latin America, with more than 92 percent of internet users using this messaging app. However, despite this digital shift, many small and medium-sized businesses still struggle to effectively manage their online sales operations, particularly when handling large product catalogs and customer interactions at scale. Yavendió is already used by more than 100,000 consumers each month and more than 120 brands, according to the company. It also removes barriers with an end-to-end platform that automates most tasks, allowing companies to leverage the conversational channel with high levels of personalization without overloading their teams. “The close contact achieved on WhatsApp increases the likelihood of a sale. However, the manual operation discouraged many brands. With Yavendió, that complexity becomes an almost automatic process, freeing the team for higher value tasks,” concludes Tafur.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670

Given the potential of agriculture in the region, which in 2022 contributed nearly 7% of the region’s gross domestic product (GDP), some programs are dedicated to driving initiatives aimed at improving that sector, with solutions from the fintech (financial technology) and agtech (technology applied to agriculture) sectors offering some of the most important innovations to help overcome the barriers faced by farmers. With the mission of connecting the rural population with startups and their innovative solutions, the second edition of the Innovatech program was recently announced, a project financed by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and implemented by the German Sparkassenstiftung for International Cooperation. This program, which seeks to boost agriculture in Latin America and Bangladesh, will facilitate access to technology for at least 17,000 small farmers. The beneficiaries are expected to increase their productivity, income and resilience to climate change. The first edition, implemented between 2021 and 2023, brought digital solutions to producers in six countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and impacted around 21,000 households. The solutions developed helped producers to improve their education and financial inclusion, facilitate access to machinery, optimize business management and take advantage of e-commerce, among other benefits. For this new edition, called Innovatech 2.0, rural organizations from Bangladesh, Bolivia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Peru have been selected to access innovative solutions from fintech and agtech startups also selected for this program. Boosting startups with solutions for the agricultural sector Fintech startups have become a fundamental part of the Latin American entrepreneurship ecosystem. The sector is the one that most attracts investors thanks to its ability to reach millions of people excluded by traditional banking. Together with agtech, it represents a valuable opportunity to overcome challenges. With this background, both industries are key to the development of this project. For that reason, Innovatech 2.0 seeks to select 15 startups for an acceleration process for the development or adaptation of digital solutions that enable producers to raise production and marketing capacity, access financial and non-financial services, as well as implement sustainable agricultural practices. “Innovatech demonstrates that startups need investment to overcome initial barriers and be able to adapt their business models to the real needs of rural communities. Together with the program’s expert advice, the startup’s capacity to work with smallholders is strengthened and the digital divide is reduced,” said Innovatech CEO Christina Olsen. The technological solutions will be used by at least 340 rural organizations in five Latin American countries – Bolivia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Peru – and one in Asia, Bangladesh. According to the official announcement, the program will also offer technology training to some 8,500 rural youth, 8,500 women, and 1,700 people from communities and returned migrants, as well as specialized mentoring to ensure effective adoption of the technologies and foster employment opportunities in technology startups that contribute to resilient and sustainable agri-food systems. Another new feature of Innovatech 2.0 is the so-called “Hub Edition”: two innovation centers will be selected, trained and financially supported to apply the program’s methodology and accompany the startups that develop the technological solutions in El Salvador and Peru.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
"Incluedu, the Peruvian AI-based sign language learning platform",https://contxto.com/en/tecnologia/incluedu-the-peruvian-ai-based-sign-language-learning-platform/,"Mon, 24 Feb 2025 15:42:47 +0000","According to the WHO, around 40 million people in Latin America and the Caribbean suffer from disabling hearing loss. This represents a challenge for a large population that must face various barriers in their daily lives. In an increasingly digitized world, technological exclusion represents a significant barrier to full participation in society. However, the resources to address these needs of a population that requires attention are still scarce, being innovation with a social focus one of the main agents of change. Given this, the Peruvian startup Incluedu, founded by Giannina Honorio Heredia and Stev Mayuri, is breaking paradigms by using artificial intelligence (AI) to transform the teaching of sign language, promoting inclusive education and reducing the communication barriers faced by deaf people. To date, the company has been funded by self-investment with a strong belief in its product and its impact. The founders have bet everything on Incluedu with confidence in its capacity for social transformation. However, they have also been recognized for acceleration and educational innovation programs. Recently the startup was a finalist in TecPrize, an educational innovation competition organized by the Tecnológico de Monterrey, which has allowed them to connect with strategic allies. Incluedu The inspiration behind Incluedu The story of Incluedu was born out of an urgent need: the lack of access to effective tools for learning sign language. The company’s director, Giannina Honorio, who has worked for years with the deaf community, told Contxto about the beginning of this project that started with a case that marked her path. “I met a girl with hearing loss whose family and teachers needed to learn sign language quickly to support her. However, the process was slow, expensive and relied on interpreters, who were not always available. That motivated me to look for a technological solution that could speed up the learning process and make it accessible to everyone,” said Honorio. “With Incluedu, we want to democratize access to sign language and empower people to communicate effectively.” A revolutionary platform Incluedu uses computer vision and AI algorithms to recognize, correct and evaluate users’ signs in real time. Through a virtual instructor, students receive instant feedback, which streamlines the learning process and makes it more interactive. “Thanks to AI, we have managed to transform the traditional teaching of sign language, making it dynamic and accessible from any device with a camera, such as cell phones, tablets or laptops,” she explained. In addition, the platform is adaptable to the linguistic variants of each country. “Sign languages are not universal; each region has its own particularities. That’s why we work with deaf leaders and interpreters in each country to ensure that our algorithm is accurate and culturally relevant,” she adds. The development of Incluedu has not been without its challenges. On a technical level, training the AI models to recognize three-dimensional gestures and regional variations required significant effort. “Sign languages are visual and complex, which forced us to develop highly accurate algorithms,” says Honorio. On the cultural side, the diversity of sign languages represented another challenge. “In Peru we use Peruvian sign language, but in Mexico, Chile and Spain there are different versions. Adapting our platform to these variants has been a constant learning process,” she says. Expansion and global impact Incluedu is not only transforming education in Peru, but is also expanding to other markets. “We are already coordinating with institutions in Mexico, Chile, Colombia and the U.S., and we have received interest from Turkey and Central America,” says the director. The startup has also established strategic alliances with governments and organizations to promote inclusion. “We work with ministries of education and government ministries to integrate Incluedu into the education and labor systems. Our goal is that anyone, anywhere in the world, can learn sign language in an accessible and effective way,” she says. Giannina Honorio Heredia Balancing social impact and sustainability Incluedu has managed to balance its social mission with a sustainable business model. “Inclusion is not only a right, but an opportunity for innovation and growth,” Honorio comments. “We offer the platform at an affordable price of $10 per month, with official certifications that validate learning.” In the long term, Incluedu’s vision is ambitious: “We want to be the reference platform for sign language learning in the world, reducing the communication gap in education, employment and services. Inclusion is not an individual effort, but a collective one, and we are committed to leading this change,” she concludes.

The association has explained that, in the coming months, a fund raising will be carried out, mainly aimed at Spanish and international family offices and private investors.

"Latin American startup funding grew 27% in 2024, another year led by fintechs",https://contxto.com/en/fintech/latin-american-startup-funding-grew-27-in-2024-another-year-led-by-fintechs/,"Fri, 31 Jan 2025 21:28:53 +0000","Despite the challenges and against all odds, 2024 marked a recovery in venture capital (VC) funding figures for Latin American startups. According to Crunchbase’s report, the fourth quarter of the year yielded the highest investments into startups in the region, being key to close the year on a more hopeful note compared to 2023 figures. Overall, funding in Latin American startups reached $4.2 billion in 2024, including all stages. This represents a 27% increase over the previous year. Most local ecosystems experienced year-on-year growth in funding, with Brazil being the country where startups raised the most capital, contributing nearly half of regional funding, followed by Mexico, Argentina, Colombia and Chile. The importance of Fintechs in Latin America What is most striking about last year’s funding figures is the role of Fintech startups in Latin America, being a bastion for regional entrepreneurship. In the last quarter of 2024 Argentina’s Ualá closed the year with a $300 million Series E round; while Brazil’s Asaas raised $148 million in its Series C. The role of fintechs has been really valuable in helping to close that financial gap. “In Latin America, the financial sector has been the epicenter of the biggest technological disruption of the last decade. More than a trend, the rise of fintech represents a structural transformation that is solving real problems and generating unprecedented opportunities for investors,” Andrés Cano, CEO of Pygma, an accelerator focused on boosting Latin-led startups in the sector, told Contxto. Historically, LatAm has been a region with low rates of financial inclusion and the lack of access to traditional banking has been a challenge to overcome. In Bolivia (39%), Mexico (38%) and Peru (36%), four out of 10 citizens have a low level of financial inclusion, while Chile surpassed Panama as the country with the best financial inclusion index according to Credicorp’s latest IIF report. Despite the fact that more than 50% of the population still lacks access to formal financial services, “this massive problem makes fintech the most attractive vertical for investors,” explains Cano. “Founders are not only developing access solutions, but also moving towards financial stability, the next big challenge for the sector.” Fortunately, that picture has been changing in recent years. According to Mastercard, between 2020 and 2023 more than 100 million Latin Americans could access digital financial services for the first time. According to Finnovista, the number of fintech startups went from 703 to 1,069 between 2017 and 2023, which represented a 340% increase in six years. The region represents 18% of the global fintech ecosystem, which is evidence of why this sector is consolidating its position among the most attractive for investors.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670

Mexican car rental startup Drivana rolls into $1 million in seed funding,https://contxto.com/en/funding/mexican-car-rental-startup-drivana-rolls-into-1-million-in-seed-funding/,"Tue, 28 Jan 2025 19:02:41 +0000","Founded in 2023 in Mexico City by Edson Arteaga, Drivana is a startup that seeks to transform the car rental experience in Latin America through its peer-to-peer car sharing platform. The model, which works as a marketplace, connects vehicle owners with users, offering an accessible, flexible and frictionless alternative to traditional car rental services. Recently, the startup announced that it raised USD $1 million in seed funding, which will be used to continue its expansion in Mexico. The round was led by Grupo Felni (investors in Turo). It included participation from Movtech Capital, Nut VC, Ferter VC, RC Ventures, Arkangeles and several other angel investors. This follows the company’s pre-seed round in October 2022, led by RC Ventures, the investment arm of Ravid Chowdhury, who has backed mobility companies and marketplaces such as Truck Lagbe and Pathao platforms, which have collectively raised over $50 million in venture funding. Betting on the industry in Latin America Currently, the size of the vehicle rental market is valued at $136 billion, and is projected to reach a value of $464.69 billion by 2032 With thousands of vehicles listed and more than 200 models available, Drivana covers a wide range of customer needs. Operating in five key cities, the startup solves major industry issues such as hidden fees and credit card payment barriers. “After personally experiencing these frustrations, I knew there had to be a better way. It is absurd that thousands of cars in Mexico and Latin America remain unused 95% of the time, becoming liabilities for their owners,” said Arteaga in a company statement. “Drivana turns this inefficiency into an opportunity, offering owners a source of income and providing users with a transparent and high quality experience. The price you see is the price you pay, with no surprises, and insurance is always included. We don’t compete on price; we compete on the quality of the experience.” Prior to founding Drivana, Arteaga built a distinguished career in finance and startups, holding roles at KPMG, Ignia and deVere Group. He also founded Wallix and Dash Scooters, which further fueled his passion for innovation in fintech and mobility. Edson is a graduate of Tec de Monterrey, a prestigious university in Mexico, and holds a Master’s degree in Innovation and Entrepreneurship from the University of Liverpool. Strategic model According to Arteaga, the traditional car rental market is in need of a total transformation due to hidden charges, overbooking and “the lack of a customer-centric approach. For his part, Ravid Chowdhury, founder of RC Ventures, explained that the Drivana model comes from the success of such marketplaces in other markets, which are also ready to be replicated. “Turo’s upcoming IPO as the most profitable marketplace company in history demonstrates the profitability and scalability of this model,” Chowdhury said in the statement. “Its metrics are extraordinary. After evaluating existing players, we identified that the Drivana team was the best positioned to execute this model in Latin America.” According to the investor, Drivana is not only about car rental; it is a fintech and insurance platform. “It helps fleets and rental businesses to insure, finance and optimize their vehicles, consolidating itself as a key player in the mobility ecosystem.”",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670

According to the IDB, this year the fintech ecosystem in Latin America and the Caribbean surpassed 3,000 startups, going from 703 companies in 2017 to 3,069 today, a growth of more than 340% in the last six years. With such a competitive landscape in the fintech ecosystem, few companies have managed to position themselves as quickly as Yuno. Founded by Juan Pablo Ortega — also a co-founder of Rappi — together with Julián Núñez, Yuno was born as a response to a common challenge for growing Latin American companies: to simplify and optimize payments in a complex and fragmented global landscape. The idea behind Yuno came from a real need. During Rappi’s growth, Ortega faced firsthand the challenges of managing payments in multiple markets. “Integrating payment providers in each new market is very expensive, complex and time-consuming for internal technical teams,” Ortega explained to Contxto. This problem is exacerbated in emerging markets, where high rates of fraud and declined transactions are common. Thus, Yuno was conceived to address these obstacles, allowing companies to focus on their core business while Yuno takes care of facilitating their payments. A comprehensive and adaptive platform The company offers access to more than 300 payment methods from around the world in a single interface, allowing companies to select and integrate the most relevant options for their markets. From e-wallets and QR codes to “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) solutions, the platform adapts to the local needs of each region. In addition, tools such as AI-driven intelligent routing and advanced anti-fraud systems ensure more secure and efficient transactions. This approach not only simplifies international business expansion, but also solves a historical problem: merchants’ dependence on payment providers, who used to have a significant advantage. Payments orchestration fintech turns that dynamic on its head by offering flexibility and control to businesses, enabling them to continuously assess and optimize their payments ecosystem. Global expansion and ambition While Yuno has already established itself as one of the leading platforms of its kind in Latin America, its ambition goes beyond that. The company currently operates in more than 80 countries and has begun to expand into regions such as Asia, Europe and Africa. This growth has been supported by a recent $25 million Series A funding round, which is in addition to its $10 million seed round in March 2022. Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global, DST Global Partners, Kaszek Ventures and Monashees are among the diverse group of leading international investors that have backed the company’s team and product. According to Ortega, these funds are being used to strengthen product and technology teams, as well as to introduce innovative features such as “Monitors,” a tool that detects and solves payment problems in real time. For Yuno, the key to success in new markets lies in localization. “Payment options and customer preferences vary drastically from region to region,” says Ortega. Therefore, the company prioritizes the creation of strategic alliances with local regulators, financial institutions and payment processors, ensuring seamless integration and regulatory compliance in each territory. Yuno’s philosophy is anchored in continuous improvement. Juan Pablo concludes by emphasizing that listening to customers and anticipating their needs has been fundamental to staying ahead of the curve. “I firmly believe that not standing still and not being complacent with what we have already achieved is the key to maintaining our leadership position in global payments orchestration,” he concluded.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Kapital Bank’s strategy to support SMEs in Latin America,https://contxto.com/en/venture-capital-es/kapital-banks-strategy-to-support-smes-in-latin-america/,"Mon, 27 Jan 2025 21:18:51 +0000","The fintech sector is showing significant new growth thanks to technology and the attention to historically underserved segments. This has led to increased competition and applications for licenses to operate as banking entities, expanding the supply of financial services in the market. In 2024, Latin America recorded an impressive 71.4% year-on-year funding growth to $2.4 billion in fintech-focused companies. Kapital Bank has managed to consolidate itself as a relevant player in the Mexican market. It started as a fintech and, after acquiring Banco Autofin, has focused its strategy on serving small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), a key sector for the economy. At the end of 2024, the institution reported an outstanding performance, with funds raised in excess of 10 billion pesos. This success has enabled Kapital Bank to develop products and services specifically designed to optimize companies’ finances. In the last year, the bank granted more than 33,000 guaranteed loans, benefiting more than 100 thousand clients with financing in excess of 22 billion pesos. In addition, it doubled its loan portfolio, reaching 6,291 billion pesos, and processed more than 300 million invoices through its digital platform. René Saul, CEO and co-founder of Kapital Bank, says that since he took over as CEO in March 2024, the institution has implemented a strategy focused on SMEs, supported by the adoption of technology and a favorable interest rate environment. “SMEs need safety and soundness, something that a banking license can offer. At Kapital Bank we combine the best of both worlds: the agility of a fintech and the solidity of a traditional bank. This has allowed us to grow in a segment where other financial institutions do not have the same regulation and robust processes,” Saul said. The executive also highlighted that the implementation of technology in business banking allows users to have clear visibility of their data and better management of their finances. For this reason, the bank plans to invest in the development of tools based on artificial intelligence to improve the availability and analysis of information. “These tools empower SMEs by giving them visibility into their finances. Our platform is the only place where they can see in real time the status of their money. This allowed us to create a comprehensive ecosystem where companies can operate from a single place. This strategy has been the key to reaching historical records in loan acquisition and placement,” explained Saul. Kapital Bank, with a presence in Mexico and Colombia, aims to help SMEs simplify their processes, organize their finances, gain visibility and access financing efficiently. Recently, during the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, the bank was recognized as a Technology Pioneer Company. The recognition is awarded to leading companies in artificial intelligence, sustainability and digital innovation, whose work drives economic development and global transformation.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Fracttal advances mission to make smart maintenance available to LatAm companies,https://contxto.com/en/news/fracttal-advances-mission-to-make-smart-maintenance-available-to-latam-companies/,"Thu, 23 Jan 2025 16:27:27 +0000","In a world where digital transformation is redefining industries at high speed, smart maintenance is consolidating as an essential pillar to ensure the efficiency, sustainability and competitiveness of companies. The integration of newer technologies such as data analytics, artificial intelligence and the internet of things allows companies around the world to move from traditional reactive maintenance methods to preventive and proactive systems capable of significantly reducing the risks of equipment breakdowns, optimizing asset performance and even extending their useful life. In 2024, the global smart maintenance market was valued at USD $12.3 billion, and is forecast to grow to USD $68.8 billion by 2033 as more organizations bet on modern systems that enable them to avoid unexpected failures and productivity losses. Although these types of developments have for years been within the reach of large companies, the adoption of these technologies continues to face cultural, technological and budgetary barriers that prevent many more companies from implementing more sophisticated maintenance systems. One of the companies that is supporting the transition to smart maintenance in Latin American is Fracttal, founded in 2014 by Christian Struve and Alejandro Perez, with the goal of unlocking access to cutting-edge maintenance intelligence to companies of any size and productive sector, no matter how large or small. Smart management driven by technology In an interview with Contxto, Fracttal CEO Christian Struve analyzed the current state of this sector and commented that “the smart maintenance industry is in full transformation, driven by technologies such as AI, IoT and predictive analytics, which are revolutionizing the way companies manage their assets.” Beyond being a solution that adapts to the digital age, “these tools allow companies to anticipate failures, optimize resources and minimize downtime, facilitating the shift to a more predictive and efficient approach,” Struve remarked. However, this shift is not without its challenges. Several challenges still hinder the mass adoption of these technologies, and this is the challenging scenario for companies that Fracttal has been addressing since its inception. The company has developed cloud-based solutions that integrate large volumes of data in real time, offering an intuitive and accessible platform that responds to market needs. In addition, sustainability has become a key focus for the industry, with a focus on maximizing the useful life of assets and reducing environmental impact. Innovation and sustainability as drivers of growth 2024 closed with outstanding results for Fracttal, according to the company. Some 60% year-on-year growth, more than 1,800 active companies in 55 countries and more than 35,000 monthly active users. These achievements reflect the tangible impact of its solutions on the optimization of maintenance processes globally. In addition, the company introduced significant technological advances, such as enhanced AI capabilities for predictive maintenance and an optimized user experience. “This performance was mainly driven by the increase in average ticket and expansion in strategic sectors such as manufacturing and facilities management, key pillars of our market strategy,” Struve explained. Strategic expansion in 2025 Looking ahead, Fracttal is planning a possible financing round during that year to accelerate its growth. If completed, the funds will be earmarked for geographic expansion, technological innovation and strengthening its offering for mid- and large-scale companies. “We want to ensure that our platform is scalable and customizable, while maintaining an intuitive user experience that facilitates adoption in any organization,” Struve explained. The company has identified 2025 as a crucial year for its growth and consolidation in key markets including Latin America as a region of great potential for growth. “Latin America remains a key region, with countries such as Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Chile, where we have a strong customer base and are looking to strengthen our position as a leader,” said the CEO. In addition, the company is exploring opportunities in Argentina and Central America, while in Europe, its strategy is focused on consolidating its presence in Spain and Portugal, and expanding into industrialized economies such as Germany, France and Italy. The company also plans to “pay special attention” to sectors such as manufacturing and facilities management, where its predictive maintenance and real-time monitoring solutions bring significant value. “Our goal is to serve the needs of mid-market and corporate companies, offering scalable technology integrated with IoT and artificial intelligence,” Struve noted. The current moment is evidence that the industry is at a major inflection point, and Fracttal is looking to continue revolutionizing the path to a more efficient and sustainable future. With the support of emerging technologies and a clear vision for expansion, the company not only seeks to establish itself as a global benchmark, but also to redefine industry standards. With the democratization of artificial intelligence and the most recent advances in IoT, companies undoubtedly have increasing access to the tools they need to optimize their assets.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Latitud relaunches its Latitud Fellowship program to support early-stage Latin American startups,https://contxto.com/en/news/latitud-relaunches-its-latitud-fellowship-program-to-support-early-stage-latin-american-startups/,"Tue, 21 Jan 2025 17:40:54 +0000","Latitud, a pre-seed fund with a presence in Latin America, recently announced the re-launch of the Latitud Fellowship, a program with the objective of supporting and impacting founders of high-profile startups in the region. In its 13 previous editions, Latitud Fellowship participants have raised more than $1 billion from venture capital investors, including startups such as Alinea Health, BHub, Finkargo and Pomelo. The top 10 proposals will receive their first check and will go through the ideation and exploration phase of their startups, with one-on-one sessions, meetings with mentors and their peers in the program, as well as being able to participate in meetings, not only in Latin America, but also in the United States. The Latitud Fellowship combines a check of USD $25,000 per participant for a total of $250,000 for the 10 winning proposals. They will also have face-to-face meetings in major Latin American cities, sessions with experienced founders and operators, weekly meetings with mentors and peers, and a trip to San Francisco to gain access to global knowledge and investors. Who can participate? The program is designed for individuals who are innovators by nature and who are at the earliest stage of their venture, known as the ideation phase or MVP. Future founders and founders can be experienced operators who have already made significant contributions in recognized startups, and who now wish to use those learnings to build their own projects. They may also be creators who have proven their ability to execute in other ways and are now looking for funding to build something with scalability potential. “As venture capital investors, we see promising talent being born from successful startups across Latin America. However, competition is increasingly global and artificial intelligence allows us to create solutions from minimal resources” said Tomas Roggio, general partner of Latitud in a statement. “After 13 editions of our program, we have learned the main challenges of entrepreneurship and the most useful resources to accelerate the process of transforming ideas into reality“, added Roggio. The program will be open until February 17, 2025 and although startups from any sector can participate, Latitud is particularly interested in ideas that take advantage of the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). The young venture capital firm already has a track record of investing in startups that have AI as a primary focus, such as Darwin AI and Hyperplane (acquired by Nubank). “We look for characteristics such as vision, ambition, short- and long-term commitment, and a business where software is a core component,” Roggio said. The firm’s most recent study on the region’s startup ecosystem, The LatAm Tech Report 2024, reveals that the impact of AI in Latin America can be estimated at up to USD $400 billion, making it undoubtedly a market that can be tapped for large economic rewards for startups. Latitud launched its program in November 2020 and since then, notable founders such as Jorge Neto from BHub, Gaston Irigoyen from Pomelo and Santiago Molina from Finkargo, have gone through the program. For eight weeks, from March 10 to May 3, 2025, the 10 participating startups will have space and a $25,000 resource to explore their ideas full-time, culminating in a solid thesis to attract Venture Capital investment. The majority of the program will be dedicated to talking with potential clients, building MVPs and discussing ideas in the sessions, in meetings with each mentor and in conversations with the rest of the group. The second half of the program will focus on preparing future founders and founders to get the funding they need to move forward. This includes guidance on crafting a pitch deck, introduction to angel investors and VC funds, and how to cultivate those relationships. The program ends with a week in San Francisco, California. In this roadshow, Latitud will connect future founders with the right global angel and early stage funds for each business, so they can present their demos to genuinely interested investors in Latin America.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
How emerging technologies will impact the travel industry in 2025,https://contxto.com/en/news/how-emerging-technologies-will-impact-the-travel-industry-in-2025/,"Thu, 16 Jan 2025 22:03:17 +0000","The tourism industry maintained positive momentum throughout this past year. During the last quarter of 2024, tourist traffic to, from and within Latin America and the Caribbean increased by 5.3%, helping to move more than 38 million people in this region of the world. However, this upturn also placed a flashlight on certain challenges that, as an industry, should be addressed in order to help the region become more competitive when it comes to travel. Technology, in particular in the year ahead, can play an important role here. Tech and AI in personalization Today there are a number of innovative ways to move across Latin America, enabling tourists to have safer, personalized travel experiences tailored to their preferences. Emerging technologies increase competitiveness and improve the efficiency of operational processes, thus improving customer service and optimizing resources. One way companies can tap into technology for this market is via big data management, in which AI can identify patterns and trends in traveler behavior. This helps companies make more informed decisions. For example, adjusting marketing strategies, developing more effective campaigns or improving product and service offerings according to the preferences and needs of each customer. On the other hand, travelers can make use of tools such as Travel GPT, an AI-based travel assistant that allows you to select your preferred language and then search for destinations. The tool generates a complete travel guide about the place you plan to visit, covering aspects such as history, climate and culture. Sustainable tourism Sustainable tourism is growing, with its global market expected to reach $11.4 billion by 2032. Yet reaching a more sustainable future for the tourism industry requires much more than just careful water management at hotels. The future depends on bringing together key decision makers and stakeholders. A prime example of this in action can be found with the Central America Travel Market 2024 event. With the participation of high-level government officials from the region and representatives of the tourism sector willing to promote tourism in Central America and the Dominican Republic, these kinds of events help to find sustainability solutions that work for the majority. Meanwhile tech innovators are helping to ensure that all facets of tourism can reduce waste in unexpected ways. With coverage in over 200 destinations, Sim Local is a global leader in eSIM technology. Not only does this help tourists avoid roaming charges when abroad, it also drastically reduces the number of physical SIM cards being thrown away at the end of a trip by offering an alternative solution to plastic cards. Given that SIM cards can take up to 400 years to decompose when thrown into landfills, the switch to digital SIM cards has the potential to make a big difference. What’s more, staying connected with an eSIM means that tourists can use their digital wallets to pay for goods and services to further reduce waste and promote “contactless” tools that came to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Connectivity in travel By connecting people, businesses and communities, travel facilitates economic activity and is itself a big driver: in fact, it accounts for around 10% of global GDP. Travel plays an even more important role in strengthening global connectivity, providing a basis for understanding, respect and collaboration. This can also contribute to a future in which everyone participates in a more constructive, cooperative and interconnected world.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
What VCs look for when investing in Latin American startups,https://contxto.com/en/venture-capital-es/what-vcs-look-for-when-investing-in-latin-american-startups/,"Thu, 16 Jan 2025 20:07:09 +0000","Thousands of new startups are created each year. The 2024 Global Startup Ecosystem Index highlighted 77 up-and-coming cities in 11 Latin American countries, countries such as Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Argentina now developing more established tech hubs. For founders from the region with great ideas, most will inevitably face fundraising challenges before they become successful startups. While there is no magic formula, there are variables that founders can take into account when interacting with potential investors. Contxto interviewed Cristian Olea Simunovic, Managing Partner of Manutara Ventures, one of the most important venture capital funds in Latin America, to understand his perspective on investing in startups from the region. According to Olea, what should really stand out is the founder’s drive and authenticity. “Maybe they have personally experienced a problem or know someone who has faced it, and that’s why they are determined to solve it. It’s not just about generating revenue, although that’s important, but because they are truly committed to the impact their solution can generate,” he explained. In addition to passion, the ability to sell is another key skill. Founders must constantly convince investors, customers and talent of their company’s vision. “The best founders attract the best talent to their team, and that makes a big difference,” noted Olea Simunovic. While direct industry experience can be valuable, Olea stresses that it is not always essential. “Some entrepreneurs have an innate ability to build companies, even without a specific technical background. However, understanding the customer and the market in depth is indispensable. That clarity makes it easier to open many doors,” he added. Common mistakes when pitching and managing startups Even if a founder has an innovative idea, a clear and convincing presentation is key to attracting investment. For Olea, one of the most common mistakes is spending too much time describing the general problem and not focusing on the specific solution proposed by the startup. “If it’s a sustainability solution and they spend 15 minutes explaining the climate crisis, it’s not necessary. We know the problem exists. The important thing is how they are going to solve it,” he said. As for managing early-stage startups, the executive warned about the risk of accepting money from any investor without assessing strategic alignment. “Money can dry up, but investor support should be long-lasting. A good partner can help with networking, hiring and scaling the business,” he explained. He also emphasized the importance of investing in the right talent and not opting for cheaper options that may limit long-term growth. Finally, he pointed out that flexibility is essential: “If an idea is not working, it is not a failure, but an opportunity to redirect the focus. Talk to clients from day one, validate your proposal, and if necessary, adjust your strategy quickly.” Driving innovation in Latin America With the innovation gap between regions such as the United States and Latin America, Olea Simunovic noted that local challenges also offer unique opportunities. One of Manutara Ventures’ key achievements in 2024 was supporting 20 startups in their internationalization in collaboration with CIC Miami, consolidating its position as a leader in venture capital in the region. In addition, the launch of a new fund of more than USD $100 million in 2025 reflects its commitment to startups in scaling stages (series A and B), something scarce in the regional ecosystem. Finally, for Olea the key to closing this successful year has been consistency. “Since 2017, we have worked to build solid due diligence processes and support networks for startups. This not only guarantees financial returns, but also strengthens the innovation ecosystem in Latin America,” he concluded.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
The Colombian ‘AgrifoodTech’ ecosystem stood out in Latin America with investments of USD $40 million,https://contxto.com/en/agrotech/the-colombian-agrifoodtech-ecosystem-stood-out-in-latin-america-with-investments-of-usd-40-million/,"Wed, 15 Jan 2025 17:19:39 +0000","Agriculture is one of the key economic sectors in the Latin American and Caribbean region, accounting for nearly 7% of regional GDP. As a fundamental axis of development today, technology also drives this industry through innovation throughout the agri-food chain; an industry known as “agrifoodtech” that represented a global market of USD $500 billion in 2022 and a projected growth of 8.1% per year, at an expected valuation of more than USD $730 billion in 2028. In countries such as Colombia, where the agricultural sector is critical, agrifoodtech startups have seen remarkable growth in recent years, resulting in solutions with the potential to redefine the way food is produced, distributed and consumed. With 163 agrifoodtech startups in the country, Colombia has highly skilled entrepreneurs whose projects will be the pillar for a more sustainable industry and even when facing challenges such as food insecurity and food waste. Leading financing in the region According to a recent report “The State of AgrifoodTech in Colombia 2024” published by Eatable Adventures, a global foodtech accelerator, the coffee-growing country consolidated its position as a leader in agrifoodtech investment in Latin America, with an estimated $40 million. The report highlights a growing investment in startups in biotechnology, robotics, plant-based products and circular economy, as well as the qualities of the Colombian territory thanks to its unique biodiversity and entrepreneurial ecosystem. Thanks to this, during 2024 Colombia surpassed other countries in attracting capital in this sector and excluding the case of Rappi, only Brazil would have attracted more investment in this area, consolidating itself as the second country in volume of investment in agrifoodtech in the region above economies such as Chile and Mexico. This in contrast to a challenging outlook for the agrifoodtech sector in Latin America, which has faced an adjustment in recent years with a drop in investment from USD $3.6 billion in 2021 to USD $1.7 billion in 2022. Colombia remains a key player, positioning itself as the second best country in the region for the development of startups, above economies such as Chile and Mexico. A benchmark ecosystem Among the 163 Colombian agrifoodtech startups mentioned in the report are some notable names, including companies that are currently leading the industry not only in Colombia but also in other markets in the region. Local startups have raised more than USD $2.8 billion in recent years, with platforms such as Rappi standing out, which has secured USD $2 billion in various investment rounds, representing 69.6% of the total investment. In addition, other companies such as Merqueo, Frubana and Chiper have also stood out by attracting significant investments. This is evidence of a promising ecosystem while creating a solid precedent for the development of new initiatives. Beyond these well-known cases from sectors such as logistics and delivery, projects such as B2B marketplaces throughout the supply chain, agri-food fintech, plant-based products and the organic production of products such as coffee have also attracted investment.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670

Latin America is no exception to the AI revolution, and intelligent solutions are powering a wave of tech innovation and new startups in the region. According to The Economist, by 2030 AI is expected to contribute a 5.4% GDP increase – some USD$0.5 trillion – to the region’s economies. To anyone who has been following the transformation happening across the region’s economic landscape over the last decade, this should come as no surprise. Since 2022, the region’s technology industry has expanded by 5.6%. It has also been the birthplace of increasing numbers of ‘unicorns’ – tech startups valued at over USD$1 billion – with 34 in 2022 alone. Latin American entrepreneurialism places the region in a strong position to ride the AI wave and to implement intelligent solutions and technology to continue to shake up traditional industries. Political changes may also present further opportunities, with Argentina’s controversial new President Milei seeking to use tech deregulation to convert Argentina into the “world’s fourth AI hub”.

The company is harnessing AI to address shortcomings in prosthetics technology. Many amputees who have access to prosthetic limbs struggle to use them as they are joined to the user through an external system dictated by muscle commands. BioGrip’s technology employs AI to decipher signals from the brain to the nervous system and uses these to operate prosthetic limbs, mimicking the function of normal limbs. With close to 800,000 Mexicans living with amputations and many millions worldwide, BioGrip has immense potential. They have already hit $150,000 in pre-sales for their nerve-machine interface. The startup was also accepted into the Techstars Boston accelerator program and had earlier been part of the entrepreneurship program at Mexico’s Tec de Monterrey. Magie Magie is a promising startup in Brazil’s booming fintech space. It has integrated online banking into WhatsApp to provide optimal convenience to its customers.

So far, the startup has handled over R$100m (roughly USD$16.5m) in transfers. It has also secured R$22m (roughly USD$28m) in funding from a range of investors, including New York-based VC Lux Capital. Kapital Based in Mexico City, Kapital is a stellar example of the city’s reputation as a Latin American fintech hub. The startup aims to transform financial services for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the region. It offers loans, credit cards, invoicing and expense management and hopes to expand to payroll and benefits. Kapital’s focus on SMEs taps into a market representing some 50-60% of Latin American GDP but receiving only 15% of institutional finance. They use AI to underwrite their loans and include what they dub an “Automated Intelligence Dashboard”, which offers a one-stop solution for SME finance. The company has expanded into Colombia and is planning to tap into the Peruvian, Chilean, Argentine and Brazilian markets. Altum Lab and Bruna AI Altum Lab is a Chilean AI startup that takes aim at reducing waste and costs in production processes. Its flagship technology, Bruna, harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to optimize production across various sectors, boosting efficiency and profitability while reducing costs and waste.

The money raised will be used in three main strategic areas of the company. First, they will strengthen their technology platform and product to make it more scalable, with the goal of impacting millions of people in different countries. This includes a strong investment in data security to comply with international standards such as GDPR, as well as the implementation of automation and artificial intelligence tools. Secondly, they will strengthen their commercial team to exceed the $1.5 million goal and expand into new markets, with a special focus on Mexico for next year and a vision of growth throughout Latin America. Finally, they will strengthen their operational capabilities to manage significantly higher demand and be prepared for a more ambitious scaling. The startup, founded in 2021 by Martin Mac-Clure, CEO, and Nicolas Morales, CCO, operates today with a digital platform that combines advanced technology and a human approach. Thanks to an agile process, it identifies development focuses, matches employees with suitable coaches and then everything is managed by the platform, where employees live a personalized development journey and the company has information on key developments online. “Our platform integrates modern and efficient technologies that enable a seamless experience for both companies, coaches and participants. We use an architecture based on Node.js and Vue.js, backed by a robust MongoDB database, which allows us to scale efficiently” Nicolas Morales, CCO of Yourney, told Contxto. Challenges Yourney solves The startup addresses fundamental challenges faced by today’s organizations. In a world of rapid change, companies need to constantly transform, and its founders firmly believe that this transformation starts with people. At Yourney, they focus on developing the “power skills” needed to face these challenges, seeking to bring out the best version of leaders, teams and organizations in Latin America. “Today’s organizational success depends largely on emerging leadership and middle management,” says Morales. “We work with them to accelerate their transformation processes, enabling better jobs, building high-performance teams, strengthening organizational culture and, ultimately, achieving extraordinary results,” he adds. The startup’s approach has allowed them to enter the Chilean market with strength, accompanying hundreds of leaders and talents in various clients in the mining, banking, insurance and retail sectors, among others. They also have a technology designed to be simple and accessible to users, while maintaining the necessary power to transform organizations. The platform allows its clients to have at a click of a button the possibility of developing 10, 100 or 1000 people, without losing quality or the transforming experience, and they expect to close 2024 with sales of between US$ 400 thousand and US$ 500 thousand, while expectations for next year are to reach between US$ 1.5 million and US$ 2 million. The focus next year is to consolidate its operations in Chile and Mexico, and to approach the European market through Spain.

"New fund created to invest €50M in AI companies, including Latin American startups",https://contxto.com/en/funding/new-fund-created-to-invest-e50m-in-ai-companies-including-latin-american-startups/,"Fri, 03 Jan 2025 17:55:26 +0000","The new fund, which will also target startups in Europe and the United States, will focus on B2B projects that use AI technology to transform industries and improve quality of life. Latin America has emerged as fertile ground for the adoption and development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. According to the ‘AI for Business Study: Latin America’, conducted by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), 95% of companies in the region have AI implementations planned, underway or completed, while 72% are restructuring their operations and strategies to incorporate these solutions. This scenario is evidence of the accelerated growth of the AI sector in the region as well and demands funding for projects, something that this fund seeks to satisfy. The newly announced investment fund has been made possible thanks to the alliance between European firms GVC Gaesco, and Next Tier Ventures, with the mission to invest a total of €50 million aimed at boosting artificial intelligence startups. “The purpose of this first fund, under the corporate name Next Tier GVC Gaesco S.C.R. S.A., is to carry out between 30 and 35 operations in B2B Artificial Intelligence startups. Our goal is to find those projects that seek to improve the lives of people and our industries through technology,” says Paco Illueca, investment director of GVC Gaesco. The fund recognizes the potential of AI startups in countries such as Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and Chile, and will be offering not only capital – $500,000 tickets – but also accompaniment for startups from their initial stages to their consolidation. This comprehensive approach is key to strengthening an entrepreneurship ecosystem that has shown remarkable growth in sectors such as financial technology, digital health and automation. Patricia Pastor, general partner of Next Tier Ventures, highlights the strategic importance of this investment: “Countries that invest in AI will be more competitive and grow faster. The birth of this first AI-focused fund is just the beginning of a series of joint initiatives we plan to deploy.” Pastor told Contxto that the fund will focus on “early stage ‘Seed to pre-Series A’ startups that have differentiating and sector-transforming value.” A fund backed by experience GVC Gaesco, with more than 50 years of experience in wealth management and financial services, has established itself as a key player in Europe. Together with Next Tier Ventures, a firm specializing in AI startups that has invested in companies such as Vozy, Auravant, Fracttal – an innovative solution for smart maintenance and asset management – among others; the fund combines investment management expertise and an innovative approach to technology. This collaboration promises to maximize returns for investors through rigorous project selection and customized divestment strategies. With the fund in the final fundraising phase, it expects to reach the €50 million target in the coming months, attracting mainly family offices and private investors. This is the first of a line of funds that both firms plan to launch, consolidating their commitment to AI as a driver of global change. For the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Latin America, this initiative represents a unique opportunity to access resources and knowledge that can accelerate the adoption of AI in key sectors. In a world where technology is redefining the rules of the game, initiatives like this position the region as a relevant player in the global innovation landscape.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Accion and its commitment to close the financial inclusion gap in rural Latin America,https://contxto.com/en/news/accion-and-its-commitment-to-close-the-financial-inclusion-gap-in-rural-latin-america/,"Thu, 19 Dec 2024 19:06:47 +0000","In Latin America, financial inclusion remains a challenge especially in rural areas; according to World Bank data, about 27% of adults in the region lack access to formal financial services, a figure that is even more pronounced in rural areas, where banking institutions have little presence. While the problem persists, traditional banking has historically focused on large cities, millions of people in rural communities face barriers such as lack of banking infrastructure, high access costs and poor financial education. This limits not only savings and credit, but also opportunities for economic and social development in these communities. However, some entities are leading efforts to change this panorama. Organizations such as Accion, Pro Mujer and several fintechs are designing innovative models that leverage technology to reach underserved populations. For example, the use of digital platforms and local banking agents has made it possible to offer services such as microcredit and mobile payments in remote locations. Recently, Accion launched the $152.5 million Accion Digital Transformation Fund (ADT), which seeks to enable financial institutions to better meet the needs of small businesses that are currently excluded from the financial system by providing growth capital and strategic support for digital transformation. Financial inclusion and opportunities for SMEs In an interview with Contxto, Adelina Dasso, a Partner at Accion, explains that the common challenges in financial inclusion issues are centered on the increase in poverty in the wake of situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. “In the latter region, the main challenges include an increase in poverty following COVID-19 and financial exclusion, especially among micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). In Latin America, we focused on countries such as Peru, Colombia and Mexico, where we identified significant gaps in access to finance for these enterprises,” says Dasso. As for the lessons learned, the executive explains that they decided to go for the financial inclusion approach because it allows a more strategic approach, compared to traditional banking: “From regions in Asia, mainly in India and Indonesia, we have learned the importance of being strategic investors. This involves having a seat on the board and working with technical teams on issues such as digital transformation.” The fund’s initial investments include Annapurna Finance and IKF Finance in India, with up to 12 expected in total. Partners in the fund include British International Investment, the UK development finance institution and impact investor; FMO, the Dutch business development bank; IDB Invest; International Finance Corporation ; Mastercard and the Austrian Development Bank. When asked about what they look for when investing, Dasso says that they focus on medium to large institutions with stable financial sustainability: “Our investment tickets are between $5 million and $15 million, and we always look for minority positions with a seat on the board. In addition, we evaluate scalability and work with companies to strengthen teams and close strategic gaps.” Focus on rurality The fund draws on Accion’s experience in supporting banks and financial companies around the world to connect millions of small businesses and individuals to the digital economy, and is managed by Accion Impact Management. The investments will focus on companies serving micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in South and Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa. Dasso also explains that they found themselves in rural areas because of the possibility of growth due to the lack of competition. “We focused on rural institutions because clients tend to be more financially excluded and need more support in digital transformation. In rural regions of Colombia and Peru, we found less competition, which facilitates growth,” Dasso says. Los Andes focuses on providing loans, savings and insurance to clients in rural areas of Peru. It currently serves 85,000 borrowers and more than 227,000 savers, with plans to significantly expand its client base among Peru’s 2.1 million micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. While with Banco Contactar, the $15 million investment aims to support the microfinance provider to leverage digital technologies to better serve underserved rural customers across the country. For the coming year, the fund plans to make two to three additional investments. For now, they will focus on managing the existing portfolio and consolidating our investments in digital transformation and financial inclusion gaps.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
A look at how Donald Trump’s incoming administration could impact VC in LatAm,https://contxto.com/en/venture-capital/a-look-at-how-donald-trumps-incoming-administration-could-impact-vc-in-latam/,"Thu, 19 Dec 2024 14:09:52 +0000","Recently, the president-elect of the United States, Donald Trump, said in a statement that he will impose tariffs of 25% on products from Mexico and Canada, plus an additional tariff of 10% on all products from China. This type of rhetoric has generated widespread uncertainty in different Latin American markets, including Venture Capital, where many investors in the entrepreneurship ecosystem are waiting for what may happen in the region in the face of the proposed regulations of the U.S. president. According to Leonardo Castillo, who heads growth and product marketing at Fintual, a Chilean financial asset manager, the level of U.S. debt continues to be an issue of concern, which also puts upward pressure on the Federal Reserve’s target interest rate. “VC firms, both in the U.S. and Latin America, are very sensitive to this level of rates, as it is a key aspect of their financing. A higher rate would mean more expensive financing for VC in the region,” Castillo said in an interview with Contxto. Leonardo Castillo Growth & Product Marketing at Fintual However, LatAm’s venture capital space has always had a long-term investment horizon that means a myriad of opportunities for many years to come, both for local and international players that see the region as a place to invest and grow their businesses. “This long-term perspective reduces the impact of short-term policy changes that could arise from a change in leadership,” Melissa Guevara, Senior Associate at Caricaco Ventures, a Costa Rican Venture Capital fund, told Contxto. “History has shown us that after presidential elections, all financial assets tend to overreact (up or down) but then return to their previous trend,” adds Guevara. “On the other hand, most of the Latin American startup portfolio is focused on solving problems we have in our region. The change of administration in the United States in most cases does not influence these “local” problems, so startups have a lot of market to cover,” adds Guevara. Melissa Guevara, Senior Associate at Caricaco Ventures New Regulations According to Fernando Florez, Chief Revenue Officer at Making Sense, a technology consulting firm based in Palo Alto, California, with development centers in Argentina, Mexico and Colombia, Trump has already made it clear during his first administration that he has no qualms about applying tariffs and restrictions to protect what he considers “national interests.” Florez says he does not see capital flow to markets such as Latin America being complicated because of it. “Although Trump is a protectionist, during his first presidency he was moderate in some of the basic measures taken by his government. In this sense, I also believe that visa regulations may lead to a talent shortage that will benefit nearshore,” Florez told Contxto. “If this is the case, it would not be strange to think about relocating operations to countries close to the United States, especially in industries such as technology or infrastructure, which is something that is already being done with good results, so it would be a safe investment, beyond the context,” adds Florez. On the other hand, Guevara states that “by nature, the VC industry is very adaptable. Both investors and entrepreneurs are used to navigating between economic cycles, regulatory changes and political changes. That said, as an investment fund we have to be aware of the changes that this new administration may impose in order to make more strategic decisions regarding the industries and business models in which we invest”. Strategies to implement Trump has stated that from his first day he will impose new tariffs aimed at Mexico, Canada and China, countries that have long been U.S. trading partners. The imposition of these tariffs could indirectly impact the Latin Venture Capital industry. That is why they must implement strategies that somehow help reduce the impact that could reach the industry. “In times of uncertainty, investing in LatAm can be a strategic opportunity to diversify and take advantage of markets with high growth potential. Sectors such as fintech and edtech are in full expansion and offer solutions tailored to local needs that also have the potential to scale globally,” said Florez. Fernando Florez, Chief Revenue Officer at Making Sense From the perspective of Guevara from Caricaco Ventures, first you have to be clear about the investment horizon. If it is long term, you have to be calm and go back to the fundamentals. Good investments will continue to be good investments, you just have to remain calm while the period of overreaction that markets tend to have passes. A still uncertain outlook It is difficult to make accurate predictions about what is to come for the Latin American venture capital landscape over the next few years. What is clear is that there could be polarization due to the types of speeches Trump is making. The region has historically had the ability to adapt to changing policies in different regions of the world and has been resilient in terms of many factors. The times ahead will likely bring a boom in local startups focused on solving problems in the region, with less dependence on external policies. If there is one thing that has been noticeable for many years now, it is that resilience and creativity always find a way. There is no doubt that during the last few years of slower economic growth in the United States, it has been demonstrated that startups in Latam can grow their own market without depending entirely on the U.S. or European market.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Argentina’s Numia grabs $3.5 million in an investment round led by Cometa,https://contxto.com/en/funding/argentinas-numia-grabs-3-5-million-in-an-investment-round-led-by-cometa/,"Tue, 17 Dec 2024 18:49:39 +0000","It is increasingly common for companies with physical branches and online services to use customer relationship management (CRM) software to track all their customer interactions in one place. In Latin America, many companies and banks keep data from physical locations isolated from their digital counterpart. Numia wants to change that. Numia, a technology company specializing in customer journey management solutions based in Argentina, closed a $3.5 million investment round led by Cometa. Boost Capital Partners, MatterScale Ventures, Kuiper VC and Amador also participated. Also noteworthy was the participation of angel investors Santiago Gómez and Alejandro Casas from Simetrik, a SaaS company that simplifies, scales and automates the financial control of companies. The platform is vendor-independent and can connect to banking kiosks, tablets and even software such as Salesforce and Genesys. Companies looking to use Numia can choose which integrations they want to connect. The company works with large enterprises in categories including banking, healthcare and insurance, among others. Gustavo Lauria, co-founder and CEO of Numia, told Contxto that the company was originally founded in 2014 as a queue management software to help companies such as banks and pharmacies manage their physical offices. The company decided to shift to its current strategy in 2020 after seeing that customers were not connecting the data they were getting from their physical locations to their online platforms. “There was a lot going on offline, and offline was, and still is, a very overlooked area,” Lauria said. “It’s essentially a customer journey manager that basically combines these two worlds, physical and digital, to integrate it seamlessly and be able to manage different customer journeys.” Lauria explains that bringing all this data together in one place creates more efficient interactions with customers. It makes it easier for companies to connect their customers with human customer service representatives if it makes sense to take an interaction offline. And some tasks that would have been completed by a human representative in a physical branch can now be handled by AI agents. “We kind of give CRM a superpower, because we made CRM reach further in a way,” Lauria said. “So we asked them to reach further offline, and we connected them online as well. Of course, online, there are more tools; what we offer them is the ability to have it all integrated.” The company now has more than 350 clients in 10 Latin American countries, including large companies such as Banco Santander, HSBC and Allianz, among others. It will use these funds to strengthen its presence in Mexico and Colombia. The company plans to exceed 400 corporate clients next year. Numia is profitable and is on track to end the year with between US$4.7 million and US$5 million in ARR booked, Lauria said. He added that the company is looking to double that in the next two years. The company has avoided taking on venture financing in its 10-year history so far. Lauria said the company decided to raise outside capital so it could approach its potential customers, many of whom are LPs in the venture funds Numia was looking to raise. It also allowed them to get the resources they needed to expand their customer base. “For us to have all these resources, to be at all the conferences we want to be at, the amount of account executives, we need to be talking to these VPs of banks all the time, and that takes a lot of resources,” Lauria said. “Raising capital was the decision that made the most sense for us.” The fundraising journey didn’t start out easy, Lauria said, as he found that many investors didn’t understand why the profitable 10-year-old company was raising capital to begin with. However, once Cometa agreed to lead the round, it started to get easier, he said. The company plans to allocate 70% of the capital to marketing, sales and recruiting, Lauria said, and the other 30% will go to improving and developing technology. The startup wants to continue to expand its capabilities to offer customers more integration options. It is also looking at improving AI technology to create more efficiencies in the customer journey.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670

Houm: driving the digital transformation of Latin America’s real estate market,https://contxto.com/en/proptech/houm-driving-the-digital-transformation-of-latin-americas-real-estate-market/,"Fri, 13 Dec 2024 21:54:28 +0000","The global proptech market was valued at USD $26.8 billion in 2022, and is estimated to reach USD $119.9 billion by 2032, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.5%. Specifically in Latin America, the industry is experiencing a moment of great dynamism, driven by the need to modernize and digitize a traditionally complex market. The region is undoubtedly fertile ground for the digital real estate revolution driven mainly by online real estate platforms that are transforming property search and marketing. In this sense, Houm has established itself as a key player, offering innovative solutions that simplify and make transparent the processes of leasing, selling and property management. Founded in 2018 in Chile by Benjamín Labra (CEO) and Nicolás Knockaert (COO), the company has experienced exponential growth in recent years, expanding to 15 cities between Chile (Santiago, Valparaíso and Concepción), Mexico (CDMX, Guadalajara, Querétaro) and Colombia (Bogotá and Medellín), which places it as a benchmark in the region. In an interview with Contxto, Labra explains that the initial inspiration to create the startup arose from the need to “make the property leasing process more efficient and transparent”. Since its inception, Houm’s mission has evolved to encompass comprehensive services, including property management and data analytics, transforming into “a digital real estate and real estate accelerator.” Labra emphasizes that “the bureaucracy and slow processes of the sector in Chile were a big driver for our growth. We saw a clear opportunity to solve a real problem.” This focus on solving real problems, coupled with the CEO’s personal inspiration from his father’s entrepreneurial background, have been key to the company’s development. “My biggest inspiration has been my father and his history of entrepreneurship … His work ethic, resilience and vision taught me that, with effort and passion, any dream is achievable,” says Labra. “What sets this proptech apart is its focus on digitization and efficiency. Instead of relying on traditional real estate agents, Houm uses independent ‘houmers’ who are in charge of taking photos of properties and showing them to prospective buyers or renters,” he explains. “From property search to contract signing and payments, they are done online, making property search, property management and real estate transactions up to 10 times faster than traditional methods.” These main differentiators of Houm are key to its comprehensive value proposition, which addresses specific problems in the real estate market. Labra emphasizes that the company offers a number of advantages for landlords, tenants and buyers alike. The CEO assures that the company seeks to simplify each stage of the process, also providing access to “unsecured leasing” to facilitate access to housing, “guaranteed management and payment” to provide security to owners even in case of tenant default, expert advice, and technology at the service of the user that allows from the instant scheduling of visits, both virtual and in person, the use of tools such as ReV, a digital calculator to estimate the sale value”. Image courtesy: Houm A project in constant growth Houm’s growth has been fueled by different rounds of financing, including angel investment and the backing of a real estate investment company that Labra founded with his partner Nicolás Knockaert. This capital has allowed the company to expand geographically and develop its technology. In 2020, Houm took its first steps in Colombia, specifically in its capital Bogota, to be selected months later by Y Combinator, the prestigious startup accelerator recognized worldwide, to be part of its portfolio. This achievement not only validated Houm’s vision and potential, but also opened the door to more explosive growth months later, when it began its expansion into Mexico in early 2021, by which time it had already raised more than $2.2 million dollars in several rounds of seed capital and that same year raised a Series A of $35 million dollars. The company’s strategy for 2025 includes continued expansion in Chile, Mexico and Colombia, the development of new products and the strengthening of alliances with builders and developers, offering a 360-degree service that integrates property management and tenant search. Its business model, highly scalable and adaptable to different contexts, allows them to face new challenges with confidence. The CEO told Contxto that “the company will focus on expanding to new cities within the countries where we already operate and on constantly improving our technology and services … In parallel, we are developing new products to strengthen our value proposition and offer an even more complete experience to our network of current clients.” Finally, Labra highlights the importance of perseverance and a solid team as key learnings in Houm’s path, which is not only an example of success in the Latin American proptech ecosystem, but is also leading the way towards a more digital, efficient and user-centric future for the real estate market.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670

"With an investment of $1.5 million dollars, Alprestamo arrives in Chile to democratize access to financial products",https://contxto.com/en/fintech/with-an-investment-of-1-5-million-dollars-alprestamo-arrives-in-chile-to-democratize-access-to-financial-products/,"Wed, 04 Dec 2024 17:31:40 +0000","According to a study, the Chilean Fintech ecosystem has experienced growth, reaching 348 active startups in 2024, an increase of 16% per year. These are encouraging figures that draw the attention of players from other countries who come to the country to continue boosting the industry. The report also estimates that there are around 137 foreign startups operating in the country. Thus, the Fintech market in Chile stands at more than 485 companies. With an encouraging outlook and in view of expanding its business model to other countries, Alprestamo, a marketplace for financial products in Latin America dedicated to connect people and companies with financing options in a fast, secure and personalized way, has announced its arrival in the Chilean market. With the aim of addressing the barriers faced by many people who do not have a solid credit history or are not served by traditional channels, this fintech originally from Argentina, comes with a proposal that promises to transform the way people access financing. For its incursion into Chile, Alprestamo announced an initial investment of US $1.5 million, money that will be allocated mainly for technological development, strategic alliances and innovative solutions adapted to the local market, offering a greater diversity of access to financial products. The company, which is currently valued at $40 million, made a strategic alliance with CFC Capital, a financial services company present in the market since 2003, which will be a key partner to develop solutions aligned with the particularities of the Chilean financial ecosystem. “Chile is well positioned to become a regional leader in financial innovation. This makes the country an ideal place for expansion, as the Chilean financial sector is quite advanced and receptive to new technologies and business models” Pamela Martinez, Country Manager of Alprestamo in Chile, told Contxto. The Fintech projects accelerated growth in the Chilean market, with the expectation of reaching 2.5 million active users in its first two years of operations. This milestone is part of a broader expansion strategy in Latin America, where it already has operations in countries in the region such as Argentina, Uruguay, Mexico, Peru, Colombia and the Dominican Republic. Among its functionalities, it offers users the possibility of comparing and accessing products such as personal loans, credit cards and bank accounts in a matter of seconds, promoting financial inclusion and democratizing access to services that have traditionally been limited. “Alprestamo allows its users to access financial options in just 10 seconds after completing a simple form. This speed, coupled with the personalization of the products offered, is one of the main factors that differentiate Alprestamo from the competition, offering a more agile experience tailored to the needs of each user,” added Martinez. The platform has more than 100 banks included and operates in seven Latin American countries, where it has managed to consolidate a base of more than 5.7 million users in its seven years of experience.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
"500 Global to select 3 Latin American startups for its program: they’ll receive mentoring and a $300,000 investment",https://contxto.com/en/startups/500-global-to-select-3-latin-american-startups-for-its-program-theyll-receive-mentoring-and-a-300000-investment/,"Wed, 04 Dec 2024 17:15:10 +0000","Access to funding continues to be one of the biggest challenges facing emerging startups in Latin America. With the turbulent macroeconomic outlook of the last two years, venture capital invested in startups in the region has been significantly reduced, but that does not mean that the Latin American entrepreneurship ecosystem does not have opportunities to continue growing. One of the most active funds in the region is 500 Global, a venture capital firm that since 2012 has been investing in promising Latin American startups from Spanish-speaking countries that are at an early stage. For the final stage of the year, the fund is looking for three startups ready to receive investment and a personalized mentoring program for a year. Those selected will receive investment and benefit from access to a large community of more than 5,000 founders from 2,600 companies from various regions of the world. “Our customized mentorship program has an initial duration of one year and marks the beginning of an ongoing, in-depth relationship with the startups in which we invest. This program is designed to provide strategic and practical support that builds the foundation for each company’s success,” René Lomelí, 500 Global Partner, told Contxto. The 500 Global program in Latin America provides strategic and practical support for the success of each company, focusing on three main pillars. “First, we work with founders to identify key areas of development and establish a detailed roadmap,” explained René. “Second, we offer resources such as mentors, specialized services and community events to enhance the growth of the startups. Finally, we establish a continuous reporting system to measure progress and adjust the strategy according to the startups’ needs,” he concluded. When asked about the main profile of the startups that have joined the program, the fund explains that the companies that have joined this year stand out for a unique combination of innovation, experience and global ambition, reflecting a profile characterized by four fundamental pillars: focus on efficiency and productivity, technology at the core, global solutions with local roots, and experienced and agile teams. The three startups that want to join the Global 500 program must be prepared to solve major challenges in any sector through the use of technology and apply directly on the program’s website. Increased investment and more support time Precisely at the beginning of 2024 the fund announced its new investment strategy in the region, moving from three programs per year to evaluate and invest in companies throughout the year; a model that also improved the investment offer in the selected companies, going from $80,000 to $300,000 dollars in exchange for 10% participation. These changes were established with the objective of giving startups joining 500 Global the opportunity to have more time to build good business fundamentals, improve their products or services and be more prepared on a general level to increase the possibility of attracting additional investment in the future. “Our commitment is to accompany founders not only during the initial program, but throughout their journey, to help them build exceptional startups with a lasting impact,” emphasized René. Focus on the Latin American ecosystem by 2025 The company already has its plan in place for what will be next year, from which the ecosystem expects a greater recovery of venture capital in the region. “We want the companies we invest in to not only grow, but to become success stories that inspire the entire region. We have seen significant progress on this front with startups that have raised capital or are expanding internationally, and we continue to build to support those stories,” commented the Partner. To this end, 500 Global has structured its vision towards 2025 in Latin America in a plan called “4Cs”: capital, code, community and content, which will be the pillars that will work in an interconnected way to amplify the impact on the startup ecosystem in Latin America. Capital seeks to continue strengthening our role as a venture capital fund, aligning incentives with our investors and the startups in their portfolio. The code includes the development of internal and external technological tools that bring value to founders, investors and the ecosystem. The community seeks to build a vibrant network that connects entrepreneurs, investors and strategic allies. And content will focus on generating relevant and strategic content that educates, inspires and connects ecosystem players. “Each of these pillars operates under the principle of compound interest: the more we invest time and resources in capital, code, community and content, the more impact we generate in the ecosystem. Our goal for 2025 is clear: to be a catalyst for legendary startups that transform the region and serve as a model for the world,” concluded René.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670

One of the startups seeking to drive this change in Latin America is Patagon AI, founded by Ecuadorian and Argentine entrepreneurs. The company recently announced a $1.1 million investment round, led by venture capital funds OneVC from Brazil and 17Sigma from Argentina, to boost its expansion in the region, with Colombia as a priority market at the end of the year. Patagon AI has developed a platform that automates and optimizes sales and marketing processes in real time. Its proposal is based on artificial intelligence agents designed to improve interaction with customers, increase lead qualification and maximize the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. According to a press release, these solutions have generated impressive results, such as an increase in sales of up to 400%. The implementation of this technology not only streamlines traditionally manual processes, but also allows companies to scale their marketing operations without the need to significantly expand their teams, facilitating the optimization of budgets and resources. Colombia, a strategic market With the recent capital injection, Patagon AI has launched its operations in Colombia, a country they consider key for its advanced level of technological integration in the business sector. According to David Grandes, CEO and co-founder of the startup, Colombia offers a favorable environment to adopt digital solutions that help companies optimize their operations and achieve new levels of growth. In Grandes’ words, “Our vision is focused on harnessing the potential of artificial intelligence agents to transform sales generation in Latin America. We started by optimizing lead qualification, a process that used to be slow and manual, and today we can scale marketing areas without increasing human talent, maximizing results. Colombia is crucial in this plan because of its openness to technology and its entrepreneurial dynamism.” Proven impact on marketing strategies Patagon AI’s success is not limited to its geographic expansion. Roberto Guerrero, co-founder of the startup, highlights the impact its platform has had on key marketing metrics: “We have seen engagement rates growing from 37% to 90%, and conversions reaching up to 60%, with some clients experiencing improvements of up to 400%. These results demonstrate the power of artificial intelligence agents to transform customer interactions and boost the success of marketing strategies.” The 2024 goal and next steps In addition to consolidating in Colombia, Patagon AI is planning a series of roadshow events in key markets such as Ecuador, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. These events aim to drive adoption of its platform in sectors such as retail, insurance, higher education, automotive and services. The startup seeks to close 2024 with $130,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and reach $2 million in revenue by the end of 2025. This growth will allow them to expand their reach in the region and strengthen their position as one of the leaders in the implementation of artificial intelligence in sales. With a combination of cutting-edge technology, tangible results and a strategic focus on key markets, Patagon AI is proving that artificial intelligence is not only the future of sales, but also a powerful tool to transform the competitiveness of companies in Latin America.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Banco Contactar receives $15 million investment to strengthen rural microfinance in Colombia,https://contxto.com/en/venture-capital-es/banco-contactar-receives-15-million-investment-to-strengthen-rural-microfinance-in-colombia/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 20:25:38 +0000","Accion, a non-profit organization, announced this week a $15 million investment in Banco Contactar, a Colombian microfinance institution with an emphasis on rural areas, through its Accion Digital Transformation Fund, which aims to help Banco Contactar adapt digital technologies to improve service to underserved rural clients in the country. By 2022, microcredit entities made more than 2 million disbursements, amounting to $13.48 billion in Colombia. The country has a significant rural population: 20% of its 52 million inhabitants live in rural areas, where agriculture, the processing of raw materials, and microenterprises are the main sources of income. Approximately 75% of Banco Contactar’s clients work in the countryside and related sectors, where costs and incomes vary throughout the year. In addition, 50% of these clients are women, a group vulnerable to economic and climatic shocks, who are frequently excluded from the formal financial system, according to the bank’s data. In terms of the model, the organization combines technological products with personalized advice through a network of advisors, who serve its clients both in commercial offices and on digital platforms. Given that many of its clients are engaged in agriculture, the microcredit company has an early warning system to prepare them for natural events and develops innovative products to increase the resilience of its clients in the face of climate change. Adelina Dasso, Latin America Partner at Accion Digital Transformation. “Rural communities in Colombia often receive little support from the financial system, but Banco Contactar supports them effectively. The bank’s rural roots and its digital services enable its customers to access financial expertise where and when they need it, so they can focus on growing their businesses,” said Adelina Dasso, Latin America Partner at Accion Digital Transformation. With the investment, Accion Digital Transformation Fund, a fund with portfolio size of $152.5 million, continues to contribute to its goal of supporting banks and financial companies around the world by connecting millions of people and small businesses to the digital economy. Emilio Rivas Ortiz, President of Banco Contactar, concluded by saying that with this investment they will continue to strengthen technological processes to expand the portfolio of products and services. “With these resources, we will be able to continue improving our technological processes to offer broader and better quality financial services to historically underserved communities,” Rivas specified.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Salva Health: The Latin American startup conquering the world with impactful medical technology,https://contxto.com/en/startups/salva-health-latin-american-startup-conquering-the-world-with-impactful-medical-technology/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 21:10:52 +0000","Despite the impressive talent available in the region, only a few Latin American startups manage to stand out against innovative projects from around the world. Precisely that feat was recently achieved by Salva Health, a Colombian startup that was chosen as the winner of the Startup Battlefield 2024 global competition at the TechCrunch Disrupt event, beating the more than 2,000 companies that applied and standing out among the 200 companies that were accepted. Among the companies that have gone through Startup Battlefield are names like Dropbox, Discord, Cloudflare, Trello, Mint, among other companies that have collectively raised more than $29 billion in funding and more than 200 exits, evidencing the importance that Salva Health’s triumph represents for Latin American entrepreneurship. Latin American entrepreneurship with global impact Salva Health is an example that Latin American startups have everything to compete globally. However, behind this type of recognition there is a key factor why many startups in the region do not stand out successfully: the importance of believing deeply in what they are doing. In an interview with Context, Valentina Agudelo, founder and CEO of Salva Health, said that “it is important to know that you have in your hands something that goes beyond you, and that you are the right person to open all the doors or at least knock on all the possible doors”. Regarding this experience, the founder emphasizes that “although these are global competencies that usually seem relatively impossible, for us the field of the impossible is what we work in. Six years ago nobody would have believed that it would be possible to create a device like Julieta, so, in addition to believing it, it is about not resting until we know that we are making the best attempt to make possible this project with which we want to generate impact”. That desire to make an impact stood out against projects from around the world. After being accepted into the Startup Battlefield 2024 competition, along with 199 other startups, Salva Health was chosen among the 20 semi-finalists, and after presenting its pitch was selected among the 5 finalists for a final presentation to the final panel of judges, which included Navin Chaddha (Mayfield), Chris Farmer (SignalFire), Dayna Grayson (Construct Capital), Ann Miura-Ko (Floodgate) and Hans Tung (Notable Capital). At the end of the presentation and answering questions from the judges, Salva Health was chosen as the winner, beating out GeCKo Materials, Luna, MabLab and Stitch3D. In addition to the global recognition, the Colombian startup received $100,000 as a prize. In 2023 the company had already stood out by winning its first competition, the XXII edition of the Global eAwards, organized by NTT DATA FOUNDATION, in which 17 countries and some 400 projects per country participated. This year, the initiative also stood out in the “Unlock Her Future”, where more than 900 projects applied. A clear purpose: to save lives The idea of Salva Health began to take shape six years ago as a theoretical university project formed at the time by Valentina Agudelo and her two best friends: Isabela and Cristina. “We started researching cancer for this project, and we realized that mortality in mom’s cancer is almost ironic,” says Valentina. “Breast cancer has a survival rate above 95% when detected at an early stage. But at the same time it is the cancer that causes the most deaths among women in the world.” With the goal of saving lives absolutely clear, the project got the backing of an insurance company to develop the research. “Six years later, we were able to build a device focused on underserved populations that can identify the risk of breast cancer. This is our first product, called Julieta,” says the founder. Image Credit: Salva Health This device developed by Salva Health is completely portable, allows the analysis of breast tissue and helps in the early detection of breast cancer. With AI technology it also helps to speed up diagnoses, a whole set of innovations to make early diagnosis accessible even to women in remote areas. “The problem here is an operational issue and is the lack of access to diagnostic tests, which is not allowing early diagnosis and that is why mortality has increased,” says Agudelo. The social impact is undoubtedly a large part of the success that the startup has had, solving a problem that, although global, its solution mainly impacts women who do not have access to timely diagnosis. “We think and develop a product for underserved populations, that is precisely what makes Salva Health’s work stand out.” From research to reality The company has a multidisciplinary team in which the potential of its talent and tenacity stand out to make this project a reality. The CEO describes as the biggest learning for the company the importance of having the right allies from the very beginning, including talent, suppliers, sponsors and others. “We had a great advantage from the beginning, which was having a very dynamic team and having the backing of SURA, which is one of the largest insurers in Latin America, to develop all our research. That gave us peace of mind and the market the certainty that we were doing our process with correct research protocols and that we were developing a perfect device with precision indicators that were competitive in the market,” said Valentina. “That is only possible if we get the right people to help us, both our suppliers and our researchers, our collaborators, everyone in general, because we are in the same line of thinking and with the same purpose,” she concludes. Although all the research was carried out in Colombia, the launch is being considered for Latin America. Salva Health expects that its first product will be available on the market in the next six months, and in addition to its allies already established in Colombia, the startup is currently in talks with potential clients in Mexico and Peru to carry out commercial pilots, while analyzing the issue and the regulatory strategy for expansion in order to achieve accelerated growth in the region. In terms of financing, the company closed a pre-seed round earlier this year for US$750,000 from angel investors. In addition to this, the money raised in the three awards Salva Health has won amounts to $320,000 dollars in total, thus surpassing the million dollar barrier; which has served to accelerate the launch of the product. In the TechCrunch competition the company opened a Seed round that will become the first formal round in which the startup is seeking Venture Capital, a round in which it expects to raise over $2M dollars. Technology to break down barriers When it comes to underserved populations and women in rural areas, access to timely diagnosis currently faces several barriers that put patients’ lives at risk. Juliet, the device developed by Salva Health, uses artificial intelligence systems to both run the test and read the test. “We can’t rely on having a specialized radiologist who can run the test and then interpret it. Right now, our device is able to run the test autonomously, including validating connection errors, validating that the data is transferred successfully. And then, once the data is collected, the device also has the capacity to interpret it in order to identify those women who are at risk of breast cancer so that they can be attended to in the health system,” explains Valentina Agudelo. Technological development is at a time when it is perfectly matched with the development of medical devices and this is what allows the devices to be simplified so that they can be used on a mass scale. In this case, it is a solution that seeks to guarantee early diagnosis so that patients can receive the necessary treatment and thus reduce the number of breast cancer deaths.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670

According to the company, the investment will allow Cometa to expand beyond its core focus on collections management, incorporating new tools aligned to maximize school revenue by launching two additional products as part of its comprehensive suite. The company is also looking to strengthen its market presence as more schools adopt its platform to modernize their operations. Since its founding, Cometa has experienced outstanding growth, increasing its size 17-fold in the last 18 months, the company said. Its platform has proven effective in reducing tuition delinquency by 52%, with many institutions achieving almost zero defaults. In Latin America, the inadequacy of the public education system has led the middle class to prefer private institutions to ensure a better future for their children. However, most private schools in the region lack the financial and technological infrastructure necessary to grow. More than 90% of private schools in Mexico are family-owned businesses and often face financial management challenges. During the pandemic, nearly a third of these schools were forced to close due to financial instability. Cometa’s mission is to address these needs by automating collections, payments and administrative workflows, allowing schools to reinvest in their educational offerings and provide quality education at a lower cost, reaching more families throughout Latin America. Andrés Benavides, CEO and co-founder of Cometa. “Running a private school is not just about delivering education; it’s about running a business,” said Andres Benavides, CEO and co-founder of Cometa. “By helping schools optimize their revenue, streamline their operations and focus on their core mission of educating students, we make quality education more accessible to families in Latin America.” Esteban Sosnik, Partner at Reach Capital, shared his thoughts on the investment: “Cometa is transforming the way private schools operate in Latin America by providing modern tools to address their most critical operational and financial challenges. We are excited to support them as they reshape the educational landscape in the region.” Over the past two years, Cometa has worked closely with schools to understand their needs in collections and across the full spectrum of administrative tasks. School principals, dissatisfied with outdated systems, are requesting new modules to streamline their operations, representing a significant opportunity for Cometa to build the next-generation operating system for schools in Latin America. With an ambitious roadmap, Cometa plans to extend its platform beyond administration, offering tools that drive growth for these organizations. Its integrated online store, for example, allows schools to sell products and services directly to families, increasing control and profitability. As Cometa scales, it continues to focus on its mission to transform private education through innovative technology. With strong financial backing and a clear vision, Cometa is poised to become the essential platform for school leaders in Latin America.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Colombia’s Cobre expands its enterprise financial management platform into Mexico,https://contxto.com/en/global-expansion/colombias-cobre-expands-its-enterprise-financial-management-platform-into-mexico/,"Tue, 12 Nov 2024 19:23:21 +0000","Cobre, a Colombian company specializing in interoperable financial systems technology, has taken a crucial step in its regional expansion by entering the Mexican market. Founded in 2020 by José Vicente Gedeón and Felipe Gedeón, Alberto Chejne and José Donato, and with nearly five years of experience in Colombia as a platform that has transformed treasury and payment management for more than 200 companies, Cobre seeks to replicate its success in a market five times larger, adapting its technology to the unique needs and challenges of Mexico’s financial ecosystem. The company has built a proprietary infrastructure that has enabled companies to centralize and optimize their financial operations through three key products: Movimientos Real Time, Cobre Connect and Pagos Internacionales Inmediatos; an infrastructure that has processed more than $12 billion Colombian pesos in transactions during the first half of the year and reduced manual processing times by 90% for its partners, according to the company. A transformative mission Since its founding, Cobre has focused its mission on solving money movement challenges in the enterprise environment. “Our mission is clear: to solve the most complex problems in the movement of money by developing proprietary interoperable technology that enables businesses to grow and thrive. We believe that by reducing barriers in the movement of money, we boost the economic potential of the entire region,” co-founder Felipe Gedeón told Contxto. The idea for Cobre began to be forged almost 10 years ago, during José Vicente’s first year at university he read a whitepaper about M-PESA, a Vodafone subsidiary company launched in Kenya with Safaricom, the country’s mobile operator, which allowed millions of people to send money in real time via text messages, thus revolutionizing the Kenyan economy. “The impact of the platform in facilitating secure and accessible transfers was fascinating,” Felipe explained. After trying to replicate a sort of “M-PESA in Colombia,” he soon identified even greater potential: solving money movement problems for businesses. “Thus, our focus at Cobre was consolidated on facilitating payments and collections with proprietary technology that solves three major pains: lack of speed, excessive [manual processes] and data inconsistency in payments,” he said. Expansion into Mexico: a strategic decision The Mexican market represents a significant opportunity for Cobre due to its size, growth in financial innovation and international economic integration. Despite having real-time public payment protocols in place, many Mexican companies face the same problems Cobre identified in Colombia: lack of speed in the movement of money, excessive use of manual processes and inconsistent financial data. “In a larger, more modern market with better financial infrastructure, companies suffer from the same problems in the movement of money (lack of speed in payments, a high burden of manual tasks and inconsistent financial data). We are obsessed with solving them with technology on an even larger scale than in Colombia,” explained Gedeón, underlining the company’s specific preparation to face the challenges of the Mexican ecosystem. Image Credits: Cobre Cobre’s offering in Mexico focuses on two key products. Through Cobre Connect, companies can centralize and automate their treasury, optimizing the management of payments and collections in real time. This system allows Mexican companies to reduce up to 50 hours a month in administrative processes, which increases efficiency and ensures consistency in their financial data. On the other hand, with Immediate International Payments, companies can carry out global transactions in real time, overcoming traditional cost and time barriers. This solution ensures that international transactions reach their destination smoothly, providing visibility at every stage of the process and significantly improving transaction times, while optimizing companies’ liquidity. “At Cobre, we have been thinking about the challenges of the Mexican market for more than two years. In that time we have prepared ourselves to comply with a business regulatory framework that is very different from Colombia (in Mexico we already have a Money Transmitter License) and we have built new money movement rails designed to be compatible with the Mexican financial and banking infrastructure (SPEI, CODI, SPID),” said Gedeón. Impact on the Mexican fintech ecosystem Cobre’s arrival in Mexico comes against a backdrop of rapid growth in the country’s fintech sector, which has experienced a 340% increase in the last six years. Mexico, as the second largest market for financial innovation in Latin America, offers fertile ground for Cobre to not only consolidate its presence, but also boost the financial ecosystem by offering advanced payments and treasury infrastructure for companies of all sizes. In beta mode, Cobre has already partnered with a dozen Mexican companies since the beginning of 2024, and expects to close the year with 50 clients. In addition, the company is in the process of establishing partnerships with key financial institutions in Mexico to have more companies adopt its solutions over the next 12 months. “We told the market the news a month ago after being absolutely convinced that the product is ready to add differential value to the companies that use it, and that the Cobre team in Mexico is ready to serve their needs,” Felipe explained. Next steps in expansion Cobre has raised $65 million in total, with a recent $35 million Series B led by Oak HC/FT, which has provided a significant boost to its expansion in Mexico. The resources will be used to further strengthen its technology, expand its team in Mexico and consolidate its infrastructure, ensuring that its platform is robust enough to meet the demands of Mexico’s dynamic financial ecosystem. Felipe Gedeón also indicated that the funds will be used to both improve the technology infrastructure and strengthen Cobre’s presence in the Mexican market: “We will focus on developing our interoperable technology and strengthening our infrastructure to ensure that our clients have an increasingly robust and efficient platform.”",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Tumoni raises $2.29 million in pre-seed round to help Central American with free remittances,https://contxto.com/en/funding/tumoni-raises-2-29-million-in-pre-seed-round-to-help-central-american-with-free-remittances/,"Mon, 11 Nov 2024 14:20:18 +0000","Tumoni, a Nicaraguan startup focused on providing banking and remittance services for Central American migrants, announced today that it has raised $2.29 million dollars in a pre-seed round co-led by Slauson & Co. and Counterview Capital. Seedstars International Ventures, NuMundo Ventures, Caricaco, Hatcher, Plug and Play, and angel investors, including former Visa senior executive Uttam Nayak, also participated. The Central American fintech’s main objectives are to address the lack of accessible banking services for Central American migrants in the United States and the high costs associated with sending remittances to their home countries by offering free cross-border transfers. Tumoni’s platform allows users to open a domestic bank account in just 10 minutes, obtain a debit card, and send and receive free cross-border transfers. The application also facilitates mobile top-up and bill payments, both domestic and international. The fresh capital will be used to launch Tumoni’s product in the U.S. and Nicaragua, with plans to expand to Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and other Central American and Caribbean countries in the near future, according to a statement. The company aims to reach at least 50,000 active users by the end of 2025 and diversify its offering to include more value-added services. Tumoni is positioning itself to disrupt the $45 billion annual remittance corridor between the U.S. and Central America, currently dominated by traditional cash-based providers. “At the current rate of innovation, it will take us two decades to reach the UN goal of reducing the cost of remittances to less than 3% in this corridor. We will achieve 0% by 2024,” said Paolo Delaunay, CEO and co-founder of Tumoni in a statement. “Most remittance companies take advantage of the fact that people are unbanked. This is a market inefficiency that needs to be solved, not exploited,” adds Delaunay. Central America remains the least banked region in the Americas, with less than 20% of the population actually having access to banking services and participating in the digital economy. Traditional financial institutions have struggled to effectively serve this demographic, both in their home countries and in the United States, where many migrants face barriers to opening bank accounts due to their immigration status. “To accelerate financial inclusion, products must be developed with the real needs of users in mind. For 60 million Central Americans, the number one priority is remittances,” Delaunay explained. Tumoni’s solution targets approximately 60 million Central Americans and members of their diaspora who are currently underserved by traditional financial institutions. By focusing on remittances, the primary financial touch point for many members of this community, Tumoni aims to create a gateway to broader financial inclusion.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Digital nomads driving the eSIM market in Latin America,https://contxto.com/en/latin-america/digital-nomads-drive-esim-market-bets/,"Fri, 01 Nov 2024 17:08:40 +0000","In a survey published by YouGov’s survey of consumers in 17 international markets, it was found that 24.6% prefer to work from home, 51% in a hybrid environment, and the remaining from the office. One of the most popular options, aligned to the above, is the possibility of working from other countries, which has brought with it in recent years the phenomenon of digital nomads. Latin America in particular has become one of the preferred destinations for digital nomads. In fact, Mexico is the country with the highest number of digital nomads, totaling 90,000. According to Restart’s report, the presence of foreigners there can be a positive indicator for the economy, since the economic activity they generate is approximately $1 billion USD. This has created a number of consequences in the local ecosystem, including an increase in salaries, as well as a growth in housing prices and expenses in some cities. But there are also other industries that have been impacted, including mobility. To stay connected, digital nomads have begun to adopt eSIMs, digital chips that provide connectivity. These are just like traditional simcards, only a physical card is not needed, and the nomad can easily add another phone number regardless of where they are. The eSIM market Usually, when acquiring a traditional SIM, individuals are required to provide personal information, such as identification number and even bio-metric data. However, when using an eSIM, these formalities become secondary, since the activation is done by means of a QR. The global e-SIM market will generate $4.7 million this year and is forecast to reach $16.3 million in revenue by 2027. While the eSIM market is relatively new in Latin America, some operators are already offering this type of service, which is also being used by digital nomads. Maria Yepes, Sim Local “Today’s travelers value autonomy and personalization in every aspect of their experience. This constant need for connection makes solutions like eSIM essential, ensuring that they can access information and services anytime, anywhere,” explains Maria Yepes, head of Affiliates & Customer Engagement at Sim Local. It is expected that by the end of 2029, 75% of smartphone connections in the region will be through eSIMs. The challenges Some experts emphasize that the market still faces challenges, such as the availability of suitable devices to use digital cards, similar to the situation with the implementation of 5G, in addition to the lack of infrastructure in some countries in the region. For now, it is necessary to have a terminal that supports eSIM, but the device must be unrestricted, i.e. it must be unlocked. Although this practice is prohibited, some operators still market smartphones with restrictions.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
"Buddy.ai, the AI tutor for kids with a presence in Latin America, raises $11 million seed round",https://contxto.com/en/funding/buddy-ai-the-ai-tutor-for-kids-with-a-presence-in-latin-america-raises-11-million-seed-round/,"Fri, 01 Nov 2024 16:51:20 +0000","Buddy.ai, the world’s first conversational AI tutor for kids, announced today that it has closed an $11 million seed investment round, bringing its total venture capital funding raised since launch to $13 million. In Q1 2024, five Latin American countries were among its top ten markets, including Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Argentina. The round was led by BITKRAFT Ventures, the leading Seed stage fund for gaming content and intellectual property, together with EduCapital, Europe’s largest educational technology fund. Other investors in this round include One Way Ventures, J Ventures, Point72 Ventures, and Goodwater Capital. In addition, a group of incredible angel investors contributed, including the co-founder of Oculus, former Riot Games executives, and Hollywood producers of iconic series such as The Simpsons. In Latin America, English proficiency remains a challenge, with economic barriers limiting access to learning English, especially in countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Chile. However, English is key to opening up business and academic opportunities in a globalized world. During the first semester of 2024, Buddy.ai and its artificial intelligence technology received 24 inquiries from schools around the world, including some in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. The company is preparing to launch pilot projects with Latin American educational associations, starting with Brazilian schools that are looking to include Buddy in their academic offerings. The latest studies speak of unequal development, depending on the country. Mexicans have the best command of English (48%), followed by Argentines (42%), while in Colombia (36%) and Chile (35%) the level of proficiency is similar. Brazilians have the lowest level of English proficiency (30%), with two out of ten people not proficient in the language. Not surprising then are the figures put forward by Buddy.ai, the world’s first conversational AI tutor designed specifically for children learning English. In terms of users, during the first quarter of 2024, Brazil ranked first, with 1 million new registered users, representing 18%, followed by Mexico in fourth place with 9%. Argentina, Colombia and Peru also made the list, reflecting the region’s growing interest and influence in English learning. Image Credits: Buddy.AI Gateway to global opportunities In Latin America, learning English continues to be linked to greater career development and opportunities. In addition, it is seen as a tool to become a global citizen, active in world issues, and an international player. Recognizing the importance of English proficiency in opening up opportunities in a globalized world, entrepreneur Ivan Crewkov created Buddy.ai to provide an effective and affordable solution. The app has played a particularly important role in helping migrant children learn English in the United States. As these children often face unique challenges in adapting to new environments and educational systems, Buddy.ai offers a supportive and accessible tool for language acquisition. By providing a personalized learning experience, the app helps migrant children overcome language barriers more quickly, facilitating their integration into new communities and educational environments. AI English The secret of AI English learning lies in combining gamified lessons with interactive conversations, creating a fun and natural learning environment. This approach not only enhances the enjoyment of language acquisition but also offers a significantly more affordable alternative to traditional one-on-one tutoring. Since its launch in 2020, Buddy.ai has experienced remarkable success, achieving over 50 million downloads worldwide and winning multiple awards in the education technology sector. The app has consistently topped the charts in the App Store’s Kids & Education category, reflecting its broad appeal. What sets Buddy.ai apart is its patented AI technology. The app is COPPA compliant, ensuring children’s safety and privacy, and has a database of over 25,000 hours of children’s speech. This extensive dataset allows Buddy.ai to outperform Google and Apple’s native automatic speech recognition systems when used by children. This is just one example of how the power of innovation can address widespread learning challenges. Merging artificial intelligence with engaging content helps Latino children overcome language barriers and discover new opportunities. Are new technologies the best allies for empowering skills? In this case, we see that artificial intelligence can turn the Latino children of the future into English speakers, creating a Latin American community that is more connected to the world.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
The Latin American startup amongst 20 finalists in TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield 2024,https://contxto.com/en/startups/the-latin-american-startup-amongst-20-finalists-in-techcrunchs-startup-battlefield-2024/,"Tue, 29 Oct 2024 19:30:31 +0000","In the fast-paced world of startups, only a few events capture as much attention from around the world as the Startup Battlefield, held as part of TechCrunch Disrupt. This year, after a rigorous selection process among thousands of applications from around the world, a Colombian startup has secured its place among the 20 finalists, a milestone that shines a light on the burgeoning innovation scene in Latin America. The finalists compete this week in a pitch competition on the Disrupt Stage at the San Francisco event, vying for the $100,000 prize and the prestigious Disrupt Cup. The list of finalists was revealed on Monday by TechCrunch, and Salva Health is the only Latin American startup this year on the list. The startup, co-founded by Valentina Agudelo and Cristina García, has developed a wearable device called “Soy Julieta,” which combines the analysis of breast tissue with artificial intelligence (AI) to identify the risk of developing breast cancer, a disease that affects one in six women worldwide. The road to this elite stage has not been easy. TechCrunch vetted a record number of applicants from diverse industries, narrowing it down to the exclusive Startup Battlefield 200, a group representing the brightest minds and most disruptive ideas in cleantech, financial technology, health tech, SaaS and more. From this group, only 20 startups – less than 1% of all original applicants – were named to the top 20 finalists, underscoring the exclusivity of the competition and the remarkable achievement of the Colombian startup. In preparation for the Startup Battlefield competition, selected founders participated in a comprehensive virtual program with intense pitch coaching and entrepreneur-oriented programming. This year, the program included talks with industry icons such as Kevin Ryan of AlleyCorp and Marcelo Lebre of Remote, as well as venture capital panels from leaders such as Sara Deshpande of Maven Ventures and Ishani Thakur of Index Ventures. These interactions and preparatory sessions prepare the finalists to shine when they take the stage in front of influential judges and a packed audience of investors and industry leaders. Valentina Agudelo, CEO of Salva Health. Salva Health joins the ranks of renowned alumni from previous years-including now-household names such as Dropbox, Discord and Cloudflare — who used their Battlefield success to propel themselves to global recognition and collectively raised more than $29 billion, according to TechCrunch. With this high-profile opportunity, the startup will present its vision and product on the same stage as these established giants, each vying for a spot in the final round. From solving environmental problems to pioneering breakthroughs for industry, the 20 finalists are a testament to the power of technological innovation in addressing complex societal challenges. Salva Health is expected to bring a unique perspective in the healthtech industry to address challenges related to breast cancer prevention, and potentially inspire other high-potential startups in the region. Throughout the week, the finalist startups will be asked to showcase their visions by presenting live on stage with a six-minute demo, followed by a six-minute Q&A session with a panel of expert venture capital judges, including Mayfield’s Navin Chaddha, Construct Capital’s Dayna Grayson, and Notable Capital’s Hans Tung. Following the semi-finals, the top five will advance to Wednesday’s finals, where the ultimate winner will be announced. This year’s event will undoubtedly be one to remember, with fierce competition, innovative ideas and the possibility of life-changing moments on stage. For the Colombian startup and its entire team, TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 will be the entry onto the global innovation stage. Last year the company was chosen as the winner of the XXII edition of the Global eAwards, winning a prize of €100,000 and an intensive and personalized acceleration program, after beating technology entrepreneurs from 14 countries in the final of the international awards of NTT DATA FOUNDATION; which shows the impact that their innovative solution is having.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
New Stock Trading Platform Challenges GBM’s Market Dominance in Mexico,https://contxto.com/en/mexico/new-stock-trading-platform-challenges-gbms-market-dominance-in-mexico/,"Mon, 28 Oct 2024 15:34:45 +0000","Fintual’s waitlist grew exponentially within 48 hours of its announcement, posing direct competition to GBM, the current market leader. Grupo Bursátil Mexicano (GBM), a cornerstone of Mexico’s financial sector with over three decades of experience, faces fresh competition in the digital investment market. The company, which revolutionized stock market access in Mexico by driving investment accounts from 947,000 to 5.4 million between 2019 and early 2023, now sees its market leadership challenged. GBM’s digital transformation gained momentum in 2021 when SoftBank—one of the world’s most influential venture capital funds—announced an investment of up to $150 million, propelling the Mexican firm to coveted unicorn status. However, the Japanese giant’s backing, known for its successful bet on Alibaba and more controversial investments like WeWork—which led to $9.3 billion in losses in 2020—never fully materialized. Sources close to CONTXTO confirmed that SoftBank opted not to exercise the second half of its committed funding, which would have provided an additional $75 million. The initial capital injection allowed GBM, traditionally a conservative institution, to adopt startup-style strategies: launching its GBM+ app and rolling out an extensive advertising campaign across major Mexican cities. However, this accelerated transformation has hit significant roadblocks. A series of technical failures and internal conflicts have impacted user satisfaction, reflected in a recent average rating of less than two stars in app stores. Against this backdrop, other players have begun winning public favor. With Webull’s recent acquisition of Flink and reported talks between Finsus and Ruut, GBM was already facing a more crowded market. Recently, Fintual, an investment manager regulated by Mexico’s National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV) that manages over $1 billion for 150,000 clients, announced its entry into the fractional global stock trading market. Public response has been remarkable: their waitlist has grown exponentially since the social media announcement, as evidenced by their public registration counter. This expansion marks a turning point for Fintual, which until now had focused exclusively on managed investment funds. With this move, the company enters direct competition in GBM’s most profitable segment, heralding intensified competition in the Mexican sector—a development that should improve both service levels and investment conditions for Mexican investors.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670

The round was led by Kaszek, with participation from Quona, Mercado Libre Fund, Daedalus, Saison Capital and Actyus. With this investment, they seek to expand their operations to the rest of Latin America and the United States. The company plans to close 2024 with around US $11 billion of assets under management. It has also secured contracts with local branches of companies such as regional e-commerce giant Mercado Libre, Bancolombia, Peruvian financial holding company Credicorp and Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual. Over the last year, this investment model registered a total of US $3.27 billion across the region, according to Pitchbook. A figure that reflects the growing interest in the industry. “With the $32.6 million we are prepared to accelerate our expansion in Latin America and the United States,” Eduardo Etchegaray, co-CEO of CXC, told Contxto. The executive says the investment will allow them to, “significantly expand our technology infrastructure, optimize our processes and further enhance our value proposition for fintechs and non-bank financial institutions in the region.” Fintech market The latest report in the Fintech in Latin America and the Caribbean series shoes the industry grew more than 340% in the number of fintech startups created in the last six years, going from 703 companies in 18 countries in 2017, to 3,069 in 26 countries in 2023. In such a competitive market, it is key to have strategies that allow differentiation from the competition. In this regard, María Teresa González, founding partner of CXC said, “Our main difference will lie in advanced technology, optimized processes and market experience. We have exclusive solutions for each market.” In addition, she adds that instead of seeing other companies as a barrier, what is sought is to generate strategies that allow them to develop more innovative solutions, she also recommends taking advantage of the opportunity to establish valuable alliances. “Instead of seeing it as a barrier, we see competition as an opportunity to highlight our strengths even more. It is important to establish strategic alliances with key players in the industry and continue to customize our solutions to offer differential value,” she said. The company already operates in Colombia, Peru, Chile, Costa Rica and Panama, in addition to Mexico. In the latter market it manages around US$ 9 billion in assets and US$ 1.5 billion in Colombia.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670

So far, the fund has distributed more than $1 million in grants in the United States and its expansion into Mexico is focused on helping early-stage entrepreneurs in the region of Tequila, Jalisco. “At Gran Coramino, we know hard work tastes different, which is why we’re dedicated to giving back to hard-working entrepreneurs in the place that has crafted our tequila for generations,” said Juan Domingo Beckmann, co-founder of Gran Coramino Tequila alongside Kevin Hart. Together with Tecnológico de Monterrey, one of Mexico’s leading universities, and the Fundación José Cuervo (José Cuervo Foundation), which supports the country’s social, cultural, environmental and economic development, the initiative will give aspiring entrepreneurs access to a rigorous program. There are around 8.6 million entrepreneurs in Mexico, most of whom seek support for their projects, according to the Global Entrepreneurship Report 2022-2023 (GEM). Last year, Jalisco ranked first in the country in terms of new companies created, many focused on the services and construction sectors, in addition to being located in the capital, Guadalajara. With the arrival of The Coramino Fund, the idea is to also support rural entrepreneurs focused on solving environmental and social problems in the region. Projects benefiting from the program. Entrepreneurship training The beneficiaries of the program will work on the creation and expansion of innovative technological solutions to expand their business projects and make their industries more sustainable and responsible. The partnership “allows us to continue our legacy of supporting aspiring entrepreneurs and small businesses at the heart of our journey,” said Beckmann. The selected ventures will work on solutions ranging from transforming wastewater, the result of the tequila manufacturing process, to converting plastic waste into fuel, to also using technology to track high-performance athletes.

"Chile’s DataScope continues its expansion in LatAm, this time in Mexico",https://contxto.com/en/mexico/chiles-datascope-is-ready-to-begin-its-internationalization-process/,"Mon, 21 Oct 2024 18:37:55 +0000","Chilean startup DataScope is taking another big step towards its internationalization. Dedicated to helping mining companies digitize and automate their operations, DataScope recently began expanding into Mexico, thanks to new funding sources. With the implementation of its platform, both mining companies and service providers are able to easily digitize their operations, generating key data that allows them to improve their operational indicators, all under the premise that what cannot be measured cannot be improved. The company counts mining industry clients in Chile, including in San Pedro de Atacama, Antofagasta and Copiapó, as well as outside of Chile in Brazil, Colombia, Peru and the United States. The challenges of the mining sector A large part of the challenges faced by the mining industry in Chile is the high complexity of its operations, a scenario that is also repeated in Mexico, whose market size is much larger. “Mexico is a very attractive destination for us, as its economy is much larger than Chile’s. Therefore, we can grow rapidly over the Chilean market. For the same reason, we can grow rapidly on the basis of stable clients who already trust us from Mexico,” DataScope CEO and co-founder Nicolás Serrano told Contxto. With the emergence of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and data mining, a range of opportunities are opening up to create solutions to operate more efficiently and securely. The startup has adopted a bootstrap approach, carefully managing its resources to break even without relying on large rounds of external funding. With international expansion, they have made strategic investments in key markets, which has temporarily increased their burn rate. However, these investments are aligned with their goal of sustainable growth. The goal: USD $10 million in ARR As for the investment received, the startup is focused on optimizing its resources and wisely choosing projects in Mexico. Serrano and another founder are in Mexico to boost DataScope’s presence. “Our next goal is to reach an ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) of USD $10 million. This growth will be driven by expansion in key markets internationally, as well as by consolidating our presence in sectors where we already have strong penetration,” said Serrano. With the artificial intelligence (AI) sector booming, the startup was able to leverage technology to launch a virtual assistant that combines the power of GPT-4 Turbo with the knowledge of occupational safety experts. Currently, 40% of its revenue comes from clients outside Chile, and this proportion is expected to increase to around 70% in five years. When asked about investment in research and development (R&D), Serrano explained that they typically allocate a percentage of revenues to advance new developments, which allows them to stay ahead of the curve. “We reinvest 46% of our revenues in R&D. This percentage is significantly higher than the industry average, where companies typically reinvest between 15% and 30% of their revenues in R&D. This strategic investment allows us to stay at the forefront of technology,” he said. HJ Barraza contributed to the reporting in this article.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
The case of OpenAI: How large funding rounds can manipulate startups’ business models,https://contxto.com/en/technology/the-case-of-openai-how-large-funding-rounds-can-manipulate-startups-business-models/,"Tue, 15 Oct 2024 20:35:34 +0000","The dream of many entrepreneurs in Latin America is to conquer the market, and while they’re working at it, secure enough venture capital funding to help them along the way. The need to raise funds for many startups is understandable if we take into account that one of the main reasons why startups fail in their first years is precisely the lack of funding to scale the business, while, in contrast, well-executed rounds of funding at the beginning can help determine the success of a company. VCs are key to the entrepreneurship ecosystem, which relies heavily on venture capital to give emerging startups and promising projects a chance to consolidate their products or services in the market, develop new ideas and, and if necessary, pivot into a more valuable company. However, many entrepreneurs make the mistake of judging their company’s potential solely on the amount of capital it has raised, which in some cases even leads to founders seeking investment rounds without a clear plan. And a bad investor — or even one who doesn’t understand the path you are trying take — could be detrimental. OpenAI and the other side of large investment rounds Often times, the more venture capital a startup raises, the more complex it becomes to keep the original mission afloat. “When a startup receives large sums of capital, it can feel pressured to focus on growth at all costs, which can divert attention away from building a solid and sustainable business model,” says Santiago Rojas Montoya, Managing Director of Cube Ventures. “In addition, these rounds can affect the structure of the company, with significant dilution for the founders and increased influence of investors in decision making.” The case of OpenAI has recently attracted attention. The artificial intelligence giant was born in 2015 as a non-profit organization with the mission of ensuring that artificial intelligence is developed safely and with a positive human impact, something that, at the time, would only be possible “without being constrained by the need to generate a financial return.” But starting in 2019, under the leadership of Sam Altman, the company’s mission began to change to the point of creating a for-profit arm that to date has allowed it to reach a valuation of $157 billion with investment from companies such as Microsoft, Nvidia, SoftBank, Khosla Ventures, and others. Image credits: Unsplash. While the funding is certainly justified to undertake the immense tasks required to develop cutting-edge AI, OpenAI is now moving towards a controversial move in which it would operate as a for-profit organization, eliminating commitments to the non-profit, which is where most of the company’s proceeds have been directed to develop impactful projects. “These rounds can also bring significant challenges that are often not discussed as often,” mentions Santiago Rojas. “One of the biggest risks of raising large amounts of capital without a clear path to increased valuation is the possibility of facing a “downround,” where the company is forced to raise capital at a lower valuation than previous rounds. This can destroy value and damage the confidence of both investors and the team.” The OpenAI case played out in an eventually very public internal dispute in which at the end of 2023 several board members began to clash with Altman’s ideas. They agreed to remove him from his role as CEO, but after the media crisis this generated, he ended up reinstated a few days later in his position, taking power again amid the chaos. Now his leadership has led to the resignation of several of the company’s leaders and executives, including the other original co-founders. This, and other similar stories over the years, represent good lessons for Latin American founders who at some point could be drawn to the allure of raising capital at all costs. What are Latin American VCs saying? Many of today’s unicorns benefited from that momentum to get off the ground by landing a well-executed seed round. But as Latin American startup investment levels stabilize at a more modest pace after the explosion of capital invested in the region in 2021, VCs are focusing on startups and entrepreneurs that create value and can demonstrate much more than a revolutionary idea. “Raising capital should not be the end goal, but a means to create sustainable companies that transform lives and generate long-term value,” asserts Roberto Ponce Romay, General Partner at Cube Ventures. “We believe that success is measured by a company’s ability to generate recurring revenue and scale efficiently, not just by the amount of capital raised.” For his part, Boris Lancheros, CEO of the VC specialist firm Lanchmon, stresses that “Measuring the success of a startup based only on the amount of money it receives from external investors is a limited and potentially erroneous vision (…) There are other crucial factors for long-term success, such as market traction, the experience and capacity of the founding team, a sustainable business model, product or service innovation, and the positive impact it generates.” Ultimately, large investment rounds can be a powerful tool to accelerate the growth of startups, allowing them to scale quickly, hire key talent, and expand operations. However, this is not the only factor to consider in determining the success of a startup.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Brazilian edtech Layers Education arrives in Mexico via an alliance with Lírica,https://contxto.com/en/news/brazilian-edtech-layers-education-arrives-in-mexico-via-an-alliance-with-lirica/,"Wed, 09 Oct 2024 18:49:29 +0000","Layers Education, a Brazilian startup that developed a SuperApp with digital solutions and tools for educational institutions, has just taken its first step outside Brazil and announced its arrival in Mexico. The launch of its first international project is in partnership with Lírica, a Mexican company dedicated to merging education with technology to support the digital transformation of Latin American schools. The relationship between the companies began just over two years ago and was strengthened through an investment they had in common in 2019, when SQUARE Knowledge Ventures bet on both companies to strengthen their commitment to innovation in education. “The two companies saw a mutual opportunity: while Lírica brings local knowledge and a solid network of contacts in the Mexican market, Layers offers a robust and scalable technological solution, capable of unifying diverse tools in a single digital environment, the education superapp. The combination of these strengths was the key to this partnership,” Danilo Yoneshige, CEO of Layers, told Contxto. Lírica, already established in Mexico with its expertise in the digital transformation of educational institutions, identified Layers as a strategic partner in driving this transformation. “Over time, Lírica realized that creating a solution from scratch would not make sense, due to the high cost of development and the time needed to enter the market. We realized that we could accelerate this process by joining forces in a joint project,” the CEO explained. Created in 2018, Layers currently serves more than 1,600 institutions, 18 educational networks and 800,000 students, according to the company. Its software integrates different organizational, communication and consultation tools to facilitate exchanges between schools and families. Danilo Yoneshige, CEO, Layers Education. Image credits: Layers. With this alliance, Lírica’s position will be to act as Layers’ distributor outside Brazil, providing a local service, marketing and market development team, which will help the edtech consolidate in Mexico. “In the end, we sell and operate a third-party solution,” Lucas Doberti, co-founder of Lírica, told Contxto. “Lírica is positioned as a company capable of offering them a market they did not consider before, expanding their business expectations compared to a year ago when we started talking to them.” The co-founder also said that it is important to clarify that both Layers and Lírica are part of the “same venture capital ecosystem” mentioned above, which has invested in both companies. A growing market Currently, Latin America has around 900 active edtechs, startups that develop technology solutions aimed at the education sector and that together have raised approximately $600 million since 2015, as revealed by the EdTech 2024 Report. In fact, recently other startups in this same line such as Mattilda announced an alliance to simplify tuition payments in Mexico’s educational institutions. Excuela, a Peru-based edtech, also announced plans to expand into the wider Latin American market, with Mexico being its next destination. The startup is raising a seed round, with which they hope to raise between $3 million and $5 million. “There are other promising markets in Latin America, which are Argentina and Chile, which are rapidly advancing in the adoption of educational technologies. Layers already has expansion plans in these countries, with a focus on local partnerships,” said Layers’ CEO. Both countries have shown great interest in solutions that simplify school management and improve communication between schools and students. For his part, Doberti says that they made use of several challenges that countries in the region had in order to provide a solution on issues of school digitalization. “Regarding the challenges we have faced as Lírica in this market, the main one has been that in Mexico there are no solutions of this type,” Doberti said. Mexico has the lowest tertiary education achievement rate in Latin America, according to information from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). As a solution, school management software (ERP) can help organizations enroll more students, facilitate online learning and potentially improve internal communication. Founded in 2021, Lírica began operations with 19 schools at its base and plans to expand to 1,000 educational institutions in the next three years. Lucas Doberti, Co-Founder, Lírica. Image credits: Lírica. Along the same lines, Mexico’s new government announced the creation of a Digital Innovation Agency that aims to digitize the processes of more than 80% of government agencies, including schools and universities of higher education. For Doberti, his goal is focused on attracting 29,000 students to Mexico in the first year of the school cycle, to then move on to the Argentine market. “With this we begin to structure a very significant growth to, in a second moment, evaluate new possibilities of entering other countries in the region,” said the co-founder of Lírica. “In addition, we are exploring other opportunities, albeit in embryonic form, studying an alliance with a channel in the United States to participate in its sales cycle in 2025.” The same objectives are shared by the founder of Layers, who ended the interview by explaining that another goal is to establish a digital culture in Latin American schools: “We want to establish a digital culture in Mexican schools and demonstrate the impact that a unified platform can have on the efficiency of school management and the educational experience. The initial goal is to conquer 100 schools by the end of the year.”",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Softlanding is the key for Latino startups to reach the U.S. market: David Alvo of Impacta VC,https://contxto.com/en/news/softlanding-is-the-key-for-latino-startups-to-reach-the-u-s-market-david-alvo-of-impacta-vc/,"Sat, 05 Oct 2024 03:49:29 +0000","After receiving almost 40 applications, Impacta VC, the Chilean venture capital fund that invests in companies with social impact, announced the selection of 13 Latin American startups to support them in their softlanding process to the United States, specifically in Miami. The selected startups have accumulated sales of $6.3 million dollars in the last year, according to the investment fund. In addition, all of them have open rounds or want to open them in the near future, and are looking for U.S. investors. The selection of these 13 startups marks the first cohort of Impacta Miami Softlanding Program 2024, an internationalization program carried out in conjunction with the Cambridge Innovation Center. It’s objective is to support its founders to scale and succeed in the U.S. market, providing access to new markets, accelerated growth, and strategic connections with investors and experts. With a market that has proven to offer a 34% growth in the last 10 years for new startups coming to the country, the United States is positioned as a relevant player for the expansion of new companies seeking to conquer bigger markets. The truth is that soft landing, or accompanying companies in the process of internationalization in a destination country, is not new in the region. In 2019, the global accelerator MassChallenge announced a softlanding program for Mexican startups; there’s also Parallel18, a Puerto Rican incubation program, which promotes itself as a place for international startups to enter the U.S. market; and there is The Ganesha Lab, a Chilean biotech accelerator, which also helps startups reach the U.S. through soft landing. What is relatively new, however, is the current state of the Latin American ecosystem. Following the “funding rush” of 2020 and 2021, investors have adjusted their portfolios significantly, making soft landing in the U.S., where more capital is available, much more attractive for startups with the ability and potential to do so. With VC on pause, the exits are in internationalization While venture capital funds are returning to Latin America to invest in some of the thousands of startups that are constantly emerging, they are doing so with extreme caution. The most recent figures indicate that in the first half of this year the amount invested increased 30% over the same period last year, although the number of investment rounds fell by 63%. “What happened with the venture capital rush is that everyone wanted to start with a million dollars,” said David Alvo, CEO and founder of Impacta VC. “Now, there are no longer millions of starting dollars, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. We have too much technology and methodologies like Lean Startup that allow us to create companies very efficiently and cheaply. Also, learning to be efficient with resources from the beginning is the best school,” explains the investor. The challenge for startups, according to Alvo, lies in the fact of “going back to basics”. On the topic of softlanding, Alvo adds that it is still a great opportunity right now, especially in larger markets like the U.S., because investors are willing to inject larger sums of money. “The largest exits from this fund will probably continue to occur in the U.S., because in Latin America, and particularly in Chile, there are still not enough corporations making $500 million, $1 billion or $3 billion acquisitions. Therefore, the big exits are still in the United States,” said Alvo. An airplane landing. Image credit: Reed Naliboff via Unsplash. Softlanding must be applied with full knowledge of the facts With the goal of conquering new markets to increase their revenue capacity, startups are looking to expand their operations to other markets, however, it is important to do so with a clear understanding of why they want to expand, and how to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the region. Alvo explains that Latin America plays an important role as a bridge to the U.S. market, something that is currently not sufficiently exploited.“Latin America has a natural advantage that we have not taken advantage of: We are in the same hemisphere and in the same time zone, with a difference of just two hours. We should be working more together, and what we are doing at Impacta is precisely creating that bridge between the United States and Latin America,” says Alvo. “What we are doing, together with CORFO (Chilean government’s Production Development Corporation), is helping companies understand how the venture capital game works in the United States.” However, there are things that need to be addressed in order to carry out a proper soft landing strategy in a new market. One thing history has left us with is learning from other cases that did not end so well. According to a report by the MIT Innovation Office, one of the main reasons why startups fail to enter the U.S. market is due to lack of knowledge of the local market and network of contacts. For Alvo, the strategy lies in the fact that startups must know their market well in order to be able to evaluate it before making an introduction to it, this takes time, and for this soft landing programs provide the necessary evidence. “It’s not that startups come back after two weeks with customers, equipment and everything they need,” Alvo said. “They’re going to do an immersion to understand if there really is a market for them in the U.S.” The long-term goal, according to the entrepreneur, is to build a community of Latino entrepreneurs who can share their learnings on how to enter the U.S. market and thus support future generations. “If we build this bridge between Latin America and the United States, Latin America could surpass Europe and Asia in terms of venture capital. This is because U.S. venture capital is the strongest in the world: it creates ideas, invests in their growth and facilitates the sale of companies,” he said. But Alvo doesn’t see the future of soft landing as a one-way street where startups look to leave the region to focus on the U.S.; the ultimate goal is to build a bridge between the two continents that connects both ecosystems for mutual benefit. “The idea is to bring companies to the U.S. and, subsequently, bring U.S. buyers to Latin America. This exchange of knowledge is crucial, where current entrepreneurs can bring all their experience and share it with the new generations. That is extremely important,” concluded Alvo.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670

Martín Cruz, CEO and co-founder of Keirón, detailed the company’s strategy to enter the Colombian market and address the specific challenges of the country’s healthcare sector. Keiron’s solution focuses on accompanying the patient throughout their healthcare journey, from appointment confirmation to post-treatment follow-up. Cruz pointed out that the platform integrates with various clinical systems, enabling complete management of the patient experience in both outpatient and inpatient services. To adapt to the Colombian market, Keiron is developing partnerships with local vendors to enhance its AI features and strengthen omnichannel. The company is also working on integrations with the country’s leading clinical software. Cruz mentioned that Keirón is part of HealthTech, Colombia’s largest healthcare technology ecosystem. One of the main challenges Keiron anticipates in Colombia is the lack of interoperability between healthcare institutions’ technology systems. To address this, the company has designed its CRM with advanced integration capabilities and flexibility, enabling effective two-way communication between systems. As for data privacy and security, Cruz emphasized that Keiron complies with all local and international regulations, implementing advanced security measures such as end-to-end encryption and multifactor authentication. The company does not replace clinical software with patient diagnostic and treatment information, but integrates with it. Keiron plans to differentiate its offering in Colombia by adapting to the particularities of the local healthcare system and the expectations of patients and service providers. This includes an accompaniment service in the implementation and adoption of digital solutions, recognizing the challenges of the digital transition for both patients and healthcare providers. The company has hired Camila Najar, a Colombian professional with knowledge of the local healthcare system, as Country Manager. This makes it easier to adapt the software to “Colombian Spanish” and understand the specific needs of the market. Cruz noted that Keiron is leveraging its experience in Chile and Mexico to accelerate its growth in Colombia, applying effective methodologies for technology integration in complex healthcare systems. The company sees Colombia’s Digital Health Bill as a strategic opportunity to contribute to the advancement of digital healthcare transformation in the country.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Fen Ventures Doubles Down on Splight’s AI Grid Solution,https://contxto.com/en/deals/fen-ventures-doubles-down-on-splights-ai-grid-solution/,"Mon, 05 Aug 2024 14:40:27 +0000","Fen Ventures has reinforced its commitment to Splight with a follow-on investment less than a year after its initial funding. Andrés Yunge, Associate at Fen Ventures, provided insights into the firm’s evolving investment thesis and Splight’s rapid progress in the energy technology sector. Initially, Fen Ventures recognized Splight’s potential for expansion beyond Chile. Within a year, the startup exceeded expectations by securing its first U.S. client and establishing commercial agreements with global companies. This swift execution demonstrated Splight’s capacity for international growth and validated Fen’s initial investment thesis. Yunge highlighted several key metrics that influenced Fen’s decision to reinvest. Splight surpassed its projected revenue for 2023, improved its client acquisition capabilities, and reduced customer acquisition costs. These achievements, coupled with successful market entry in Europe and the United States, were decisive factors for the follow-on investment. Fen Ventures’ approach balances Splight’s growth potential against the inherent risks of the highly regulated energy sector. The firm prioritizes backing exceptional teams with clear market vision and problem-solving capabilities. Yunge emphasized the strength of Splight’s founding team – Fernando, Thomas, and Carlos – noting their deep understanding of the energy market and strong industry connections. The startup’s ability to adapt to diverse regulatory frameworks in target markets further solidified Fen’s confidence. Yunge explained that Splight’s team has worked closely with regulators in Chile, gaining valuable insights into energy market regulations. This experience has equipped them to navigate complex regulatory landscapes in new markets. Beyond capital, Fen Ventures adds value through international validation, key client introductions in Latin America, and fundraising guidance. The firm’s extensive network in the energy industry and venture capital circles across Latin America and the United States continues to support Splight’s global ambitions. Yunge noted that despite having an oversubscribed funding round, Splight reserved Fen’s desired investment allocation, reflecting the strong partnership between the two companies. Sustainability and environmental impact play a significant role in Fen Ventures’ investment strategy. Yunge stated that Splight aligns with these goals by addressing curtailment issues in the energy industry. In just one year, Splight increased its valuation by more than twofold while contributing to solutions for energy curtailment challenges, demonstrating both financial returns and positive market impact. To mitigate potential dilution in future funding rounds, Fen Ventures allocates a substantial portion of its fund for follow-on investments in top-performing portfolio companies. Yunge explained that this strategy, coupled with standard industry legal clauses, helps protect the firm’s interests as Splight continues to grow and attract new investors. Fen Ventures’ investment decision process heavily emphasizes the quality of the leadership team. Yunge described it as one of the primary factors they consider, stating that a committed and cohesive team with in-depth market knowledge and a clear understanding of the problem they’re solving is a key predictor of success. Splight’s team demonstrated these qualities from the outset. Looking ahead, Fen Ventures remains confident in Splight’s potential to scale globally and make a lasting impact on the energy sector. As the startup expands its reach and tackles complex energy management challenges worldwide, Fen Ventures continues to provide both capital and strategic support to fuel the company’s ambitious growth trajectory. Yunge concluded by emphasizing the mutually beneficial relationship between Fen Ventures and Splight. The venture capital firm’s early investment provided crucial validation for Splight’s international expansion, while Splight’s impressive execution and growth have reinforced Fen’s investment thesis. This successful partnership exemplifies Fen Ventures’ commitment to fostering innovation and supporting high-potential startups in the energy technology sector.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670

They’re not messing around, aiming for 5 new spots in Mexico and 8 in the US over the next three years. We’re talking prime real estate in places like Mexico City, Guadalajara, New York, and Miami. Now, let’s talk numbers. In Mexico, they’re eyeing revenues to jump from €2 million in 2024 to a whopping €16 million by 2028. Not too shabby, right? The US is looking even juicier, with revenues expected to climb from €3 million to €22 million. And here’s the kicker – they’re hoping to break even in these new markets in just 18 to 24 months. But it’s not just about the money. Enso’s got some tricks up its sleeve to stand out. We’re talking private chefs, exclusive community events – the works. They’re doing their homework too, adapting to local tastes and rules. Smart move, if you ask me. To keep those rooms full (and they’re aiming for 100% occupancy), they’re going all in on digital marketing, teaming up with influencers, and working hard to keep residents happy. They’re also buddying up with local investors and developers to snag and revamp properties. Tech-wise, they’re not skimping. Home automation, fancy mobile apps, smart sustainability stuff – they’re throwing it all in to make coliving smoother and more efficient. Who are they after? Young professionals, digital nomads, expats – basically, anyone looking for a flexible, community-vibe living situation. They’re trying to set themselves apart from your run-of-the-mill rentals with all-inclusive services and those flexible contracts. Now, let’s get into the nitty-gritty. Enso’s currently valued at $22 million. They’ve got this impressive stat where each customer’s lifetime value is 6.8 times what it costs to get them on board. Average revenue per user? A tidy €865. And get this – they’re already in the black with positive EBITDA. They’re not naive about the challenges, though. Currency risks, recruitment, maintaining company culture – they’ve got plans for it all. They’re setting up local teams, standardizing processes, and keeping their corporate vibe alive with training and team-building stuff. What about the competition? Enso’s banking on prime locations and local partnerships to hold their own against established players. They’re also applying lessons from their Spanish playbook, focusing on adapting to each market. Looking ahead, they’re ready for some bumps. Operational costs might spike initially, but they’re counting on economies of scale to smooth things out long-term. They’re also spreading their bets across markets to hedge against economic and political curveballs. Financially, they’re keeping their options open. They might go for more funding rounds down the line, and they’re eyeing various exit strategies for investors – we’re talking potential buyouts, IPOs, even some fancy stuff like Phantom Shares for employees. All in all, Enso’s making a big bet on the future of urban living. They’re seeing a growing appetite for flexible, community-focused spaces in cities, and they’re going all in to meet that demand. It’ll be interesting to see how this plays out in the coming years.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670

"Edson Arteaga, Drivana’s CEO shares how they prepare for their fundraising with Arkangeles",https://contxto.com/en/news/drivana-launches-crowd-equity-campaign/,"Fri, 26 Jul 2024 08:53:58 +0000","In an exclusive interview, Edson Arteaga shared his experience on preparing the company for raising funds through Arkangeles, and insights that fellow founders might leverage when looking to raise money. You can find the details of the campaign following the interview, where Edson describes how he wants to enable individual investors to participate in what the company describes as “the next Mexican unicorn” in the making. The Conversation How does Arkangeles’ due diligence process compare to traditional VC scrutiny, and did it reveal any unexpected insights about your business? The process is rigorous, analyzing operational, financial, and strategic aspects in-depth, similar to traditional VC scrutiny but more agile. Arkangeles emphasizes transparency and information accessibility for a broader investor audience. We discovered the importance of simplifying and clearly communicating our value proposition to a diverse audience, not necessarily investment experts. How has the equity crowdfunding campaign influenced your product roadmap or business strategy? Are there specific features or initiatives that gained traction due to investor feedback? Many crowdfunding investors are Drivana users, providing direct feedback from a diverse community. Initiatives like WhatsApp reservation integration and personalized insurance offerings gained traction from this feedback. Investors particularly valued features enhancing platform accessibility and security. How do you balance the increased transparency required for equity crowdfunding with the need to protect competitive advantages? Can you share an example of a strategic decision that was difficult to communicate publicly? We adhere to transparency principles while protecting our competitive advantages by sharing enough information to build trust without revealing critical details competitors could use. For example, we chose not to publicly disclose our exact risk assessment algorithm, though we explained its purpose and benefits generally. This decision was challenging, as we wanted to showcase our technological sophistication without compromising our competitive edge. Have you noticed any correlation between crowdfunding investors and user acquisition or retention? How are you leveraging this unique investor-customer relationship? Yes, many investors become active users and platform promoters. We leverage this relationship by incentivizing investors to use and recommend Drivana, increasing both acquisition and retention. We implement referral programs and exclusive benefits for investors, such as special rental discounts, encouraging their active participation on the platform. What unexpected challenges did you face in structuring your SAFE agreement for an equity crowdfunding context, and how did you address them? The structuring process is similar to traditional methods. The challenge lies in explaining the SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) concept to non-institutional investors. The platform provides extensive educational content for those unfamiliar with the ecosystem. Drivana is also creating educational materials and organizing webinars to clarify how SAFE works, its benefits, implications, etc., ensuring investors fully understand the terms and security of their investment. How has the equity crowdfunding campaign affected your conversations with institutional investors? Has it changed the dynamics of these conversations in ways you didn’t anticipate? Not necessarily, but we believe this crowdfunding campaign will help demonstrate our attractiveness and community support to institutional investors, strengthening our negotiating position. Having a solid base of support validating our business model allows us to negotiate from a stronger position. In retrospect, what would you have done differently in preparing for the equity crowdfunding campaign? Are there specific metrics or materials you wish you had developed beforehand? Regarding metrics, we have all our information well-organized and accessible. In retrospect, we would have developed more simplified educational content about the investment process and crowdfunding benefits to have ready. We’d also simplify terms that might be unfamiliar to non-institutional investors. How are you managing investor relations with a potentially diverse and geographically dispersed crowd of small investors? Have you implemented any innovative communication strategies? All our investors have access to a monthly investor update sharing progress, obstacles, metrics, reports, and all relevant occurrences during the month. This allows for clear, transparent communication and access to a broader sector for support when needed, such as talent recommendations for new positions. Has the equity crowdfunding process revealed any interesting patterns or segments within your investor base that you didn’t expect? How might these insights inform your future growth strategies? We appreciated the interest from a young segment, many venturing into this investment asset for the first time, mainly enthusiasts of innovation and technology. These insights indicate we should focus our marketing and growth strategies on these segments, developing features and campaigns that resonate with their technological interests and needs. Looking ahead, how do you envision integrating equity crowdfunding investors into potential future funding rounds or exit strategies? Are there any unique considerations or plans you’re developing? We plan to keep our crowdfunding investors informed and engaged through regular updates and opportunities to participate in future rounds. We’re considering offering preferential rights for future capital increases and maintaining a close relationship to ensure their continued loyalty and support. Regarding exit strategies, these investors are clearly an integral part of our plan, ensuring they benefit proportionally from Drivana’s success. The Fund raising campaign with Arkangeles From Personal Frustration to Market Disruption Edson Arteaga, CEO and founder of Drivana, shared the origin story of the company in a recent interview. “It was precisly what happened to us,” Arteaga recounted, describing a frustrating experience trying to rent a car for a weekend trip. “I reserved and paid weeks in advance, only to arrive at the counter and be told they had my reservation but no cars available.” This experience led Arteaga to question the entire car rental industry. “I thought, ‘What’s the point of making a reservation?’ The price I paid online wasn’t the real price. I ended up paying three times more due to hidden costs,” he explained. A New Vision for Car Rentals Drivana was born from this frustration, with a vision to make renting a car as simple as sending a WhatsApp message. The platform connects users seeking to rent a car with local hosts who generate income by renting out their vehicles. “Our model isn’t just about being cheaper,” Arteaga emphasized. “It’s about providing a better experience. Users can have a car delivered directly to their home without having to leave the house. You pay for what you receive.” Rapid Growth and Market Validation Since its launch in March 2023, Drivana has demonstrated significant traction: Expanded from a pilot in Mexico City to operations in 5 major cities Completed over 4,000 rental days Generated $315,000 USD in Gross Booking Value in the last 12 months Acquired more than 12,000 registered users Listed over 1,000 cars on the platform “We’re seeing a shift in consumer behavior,” Arteaga noted. “About 20% of our users make three or more rentals per month. Many are realizing it doesn’t make sense to own a car and deal with maintenance, services, and parking costs when they can rent one through Drivana only for the time they need it.” The Crowd Equity Opportunity Drivana is now inviting the public to be part of its growth story through a crowd equity campaign on Arkangeles. Key details of the investment opportunity include: Minimum investment: 5,000 MXN (approximately $275 USD) Post-money valuation: $8 million USD Fundraising goal on Arkangeles: 550,000 MXN (approximately $30,000 USD) Investment instrument: SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) Investors will also enjoy special perks, including discounts on rentals for 6 months. Innovative Features and Competitive Edge Drivana sets itself apart through several key features: Advanced Security: “We’ve developed a unique algorithm for risk assessment of each user,” Arteaga explained. “We validate documents, conduct facial recognition, check criminal records, and even verify employment and income.” Insurance and Recovery Services: Drivana has partnered with HDI, the third-largest insurance provider in Latin America, for customized insurance solutions. They also offer GPS tracking and vehicle recovery services in partnership with Encontrack. WhatsApp Integration: “We’re working on integrating our platform with WhatsApp,” Arteaga revealed. “Users will be able to search and book directly through WhatsApp using AI and an automated flow.” Market Potential and Future Plans Drivana is targeting a significant share of Mexico’s car rental market, estimated at 4.7 billion USD annually. The company plans to use the funds raised to expand to 7 new cities in Mexico, enhance its technology platform, and acquire top talent. “We estimate having a presence in at least four more cities within the Mexican Republic by the end of the year,” Arteaga shared. “By mid-next year, we’re looking to expand to other Latin American countries.” A Call to Investors Arteaga concluded the interview with a call to potential investors: “If you share our vision and want to join as a co-pilot on our path to becoming the next Mexican unicorn, with high potential for investment return, we invite you to be part of this exciting journey.” For those interested in participating in Drivana’s growth, more information can be found on the Arkangeles platform.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Dusko Kelez on Hapi’s Expansion to Latin American,https://contxto.com/en/scaleups/dusko-kelez-on-hapis-expansion-to-latin-american/,"Thu, 25 Jul 2024 08:52:44 +0000","Hapi, founded by Peruvians Dusko Kelez, Piero Sifuentes, and Billy Caballero in 2020, developed a mobile app for investors to access the US stock market. The startup joined Y Combinator in 2021 and has raised $4.3 million in total funding. Users can buy fractional shares starting at $5 or cryptocurrencies from $1 without broker commissions. Hapi generates revenue through premium memberships, asset utilization, and exchange fees. The platform offers free educational resources and courses from Latin American financial content creators. Kelez, Hapi’s CEO, explained the benefits of investing in the US market: “The US stock exchange is the largest and most liquid globally, offering more investment options, access to the latest technology, and liquidity for easy buying and selling. Leading tech companies list there, and the dollar’s strength provides protection against potential local currency devaluation.” For 2024, Hapi plans to launch Hapi Prime, a premium subscription with advanced tools for experienced investors, and DRIP, a dividend reinvestment program. The company aims to maintain its competitive edge by focusing on customer needs and product innovation. Hapi operates under FINRA and SEC regulations, with a US broker-dealer license. Kelez emphasized their commitment to regulatory compliance: “We’re proud of our strict procedures and regulatory compliance, giving our clients peace of mind. Their money and shares are safe, insured by SIPC up to $500,000.” The startup measures the success of its educational initiatives through client investment performance relative to risk. Kelez stated, “If our clients do well with their investments, we’ll do well over time.” Addressing risk management for inexperienced investors, Kelez clarified: “Hapi is a broker offering self-directed products. Users decide where to invest among 12,000+ available assets. Diversification is key to mitigate risk, and Hapi allows clients to buy fractional shares from $5, enabling diversification even with small amounts.” Hapi’s educational content focuses on objective information about financial products without offering investment recommendations. The company aims to provide users with the necessary information to understand investment cycles and prepare for market fluctuations. Regarding customer support, Kelez said, “Our goal is that they never need to contact support. The best support is the one that was never necessary. We constantly work with that goal in mind.” Hapi maintains a positive cash flow and has the financial backing of Y Combinator. While currently focused on investment products, the company remains open to strategic partnerships that address customer needs. Kelez highlighted Hapi’s talent acquisition strategy: “The key for us is having team members who share our passion for finance, investments, and want to make a positive impact on society.” The company prioritizes hiring programmers and maintains a solid team without current open positions. On potential macroeconomic challenges, Kelez emphasized the importance of educating investors about market cycles and preparing them for various scenarios. He stated, “Knowing these cycles exist allows you to prepare and plan when it hasn’t happened yet, then you just follow your plan according to the strategy outlined.” As Hapi continues to grow, Kelez remains committed to their mission: “We’re very happy with the reception of our product to date. Today we have more than 500,000 customers throughout Latin America, almost double that of a year ago. However, we believe we are still far from fully fulfilling our mission. We will continue working until everyone in Latin America knows they can be the owner of their financial destiny with tools like Hapi.”",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Lina Vanegas shares a First-Hand Account for Betterfly’s Strategy for Mexican Expansion,https://contxto.com/en/mexico/lina-vanega-shares-a-first-hand-account-for-betterflys-strategy-for-mexican-expansion/,"Wed, 24 Jul 2024 08:36:03 +0000","When we decided to enter the Mexican market, I knew Betterfly’s adaptation would be key. Our platform needed to align with local regulations, particularly NOM 035, which mandates workplace psychosocial well-being initiatives. This regulatory landscape shaped our entire approach. We’ve structured our offerings to cater to different business sizes. For large corporations, our plans start at 85 MXN + VAT per employee, while for SMBs, we begin at 200 MXN + VAT per employee monthly. This tiered approach, coupled with our SaaS model, allows us to serve a broad spectrum of Mexican businesses. Partnerships have been crucial to our success in Mexico. We’ve forged alliances with global wellness providers like Udemy, Headspace, and FitOn. Simultaneously, we’ve collaborated with local foundations such as Reinserta, Grupo Murlota, and Únete. This dual approach enables us to offer a comprehensive suite of benefits that resonates with Mexican employees. Our research showed that while 48% of Mexicans consider benefits crucial for job retention, only 38% feel these benefits meet their needs. This gap informed our strategy to prioritize physical and mental well-being in our offerings. Building trust was paramount in a market where we were initially unknown. We focused on transparency, high-quality services, and demonstrating tangible improvements in workplace well-being. This approach has paid off, resulting in over 400 clients across major Mexican cities including CDMX, Querétaro, Monterrey, and Guadalajara. We encountered significant technical hurdles in integrating with local systems, managing large data volumes, and ensuring scalability. To overcome these, we invested heavily in our tech infrastructure and obtained ISO 9001, 14001, and 27001 certifications to ensure data privacy and security compliance. Maintaining our corporate culture during rapid growth has been crucial. We live by five fundamental values: action bias, giving perfect effort, acting with purpose, dreaming big, and unleashing human connection. These values have guided our expansion and helped us maintain our identity in a new market. To support our rapid growth, we implemented career development tools like Career Path and Performance Review. These allow us to evaluate and nurture talent throughout their professional journey with us. As a Public Benefit Corporation and B Corp, our social impact focus has been a cornerstone of our operations in Mexico. We’ve integrated this into our business model, collaborating with local foundations to address pressing social issues. We use a combination of engagement metrics, customer satisfaction, and impact on employee well-being to evaluate our performance. Our new experience is designed to address various HR KPIs, helping companies improve engagement, reduce benefits costs, and boost employee satisfaction. We’ve worked to understand and complement strategies for compliance with NOM 035. Our platform offers services like meditation, telemedicine, and physical training, which align with the law’s requirements for promoting employee well-being. Our experience in Mexico has been invaluable. The lessons we’ve learned about adapting to local needs, building strategic partnerships, and maintaining our core values during rapid expansion will guide our future growth in other markets. We’re committed to continually evolving our platform to meet the unique needs of each market we enter, always with the goal of improving workplace well-being and driving positive social impact.

Alex Sandoval from Allie on how to implement autonomous manufacturing,https://contxto.com/en/artificial-intelligence/alex-sandoval-from-allie-on-how-to-implement-autonomous-manufacturing/,"Tue, 23 Jul 2024 10:10:29 +0000","The manufacturing industry is facing a crucial turning point. Automation is no longer enough; autonomous manufacturing is now leading the real revolution. AI agents capable of making real-time decisions are driving this transformation, optimizing every aspect of the production process. A recent survey revealed that 90% of companies will use automation to improve cost efficiency. However, the cutting edge of innovation goes further. The most advanced AI agents not only automate repetitive tasks, but also make complex decisions. They adjust production parameters in real time, maximizing efficiency and final product quality. Implementing these cutting-edge technologies requires a structured approach. After helping numerous companies adopt autonomous manufacturing, we have identified four essential steps for a successful implementation. 1. Strategic selection of technologies and suppliers Before diving into the world of autonomous manufacturing, it is crucial to identify specific business needs. Are you looking to optimize product quality? Reduce waste? Improve energy efficiency? The most advanced AI players can address all of these issues simultaneously, but it is important to be clear on the priority objectives. When evaluating vendors, it is essential to consider: The ability to integrate with existing systems Data security and compliance protocols Scalability of the solution Technical support and training offered It is crucial to verify that solutions comply with industry-specific regulations. State-of-the-art IA agents not only comply with these regulations, but also help maintain a detailed record to facilitate audits and certifications. 2. Human capital preparation and training The transition to autonomous manufacturing requires a prepared and engaged workforce. Experience shows that the success of implementation is directly related to the level of employee understanding and buy-in. A three-tiered approach is recommended: Awareness: Educate on the benefits of autonomous manufacturing Technical training: Train in the use and supervision of autonomous systems Complementary skills development: Encourage analytical thinking and complex problem solving It is critical to involve employees in the implementation process, gathering their feedback and leveraging their knowledge of the production process to optimize the operation of AI agents. A key strategy that determines success is the alignment of incentives at all levels. 3. Data transformation and preparation The effectiveness of autonomous manufacturing systems depends heavily on the quality and accessibility of data. Methodologies have been developed to help companies prepare their data for the era of autonomy: Identification of relevant data sources: From sensors on the production line to ERP systems and quality records Data cleansing and standardization: Ensuring consistency and accuracy of information Implementation of real-time data collection systems: Essential for autonomous decision making Developing a scalable data architecture: Prepared for future growth Next-generation AI agents are designed to continuously learn from this data, improving their performance over time and adapting to new production conditions. 4. Continuous monitoring and optimization Implementing autonomous manufacturing is not a project with a defined end, but a process of continuous improvement. It is crucial to establish clear KPIs and real-time monitoring systems. Some recommended KPIs include: Overall equipment efficiency (OEE) Production rate Product quality (defect rate) Energy consumption Unplanned downtime Advanced AI agents not only help monitor these KPIs, but actively work to optimize them, adjusting production parameters in real time to maximize efficiency and quality. In addition, it is important to maintain an open dialogue with employees, gathering their feedback and suggestions. The combination of artificial intelligence with human expertise is what truly drives successful execution. Conclusion Autonomous manufacturing marks a quantum leap in the manufacturing industry. AI agents redefine the boundaries of what is possible by making autonomous decisions and optimizing processes in real time. To implement these technologies successfully, companies must: Plan carefully Prepare their workforce Ensure high-quality data Commit to continuous improvement By following these four essential steps, companies can realize the full potential of autonomous manufacturing, achieving unprecedented levels of efficiency, quality and sustainability. The future of manufacturing integrates artificial intelligence with human expertise in perfect harmony. This synergy drives innovation and sets new industry standards. We should no longer ask ourselves if we will adopt these technologies, but when and how to do it in the most effective way. By Alex Sandoval, Founder of Allie",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670

DomestikCo operates with a team of eight and aims to capture 4,000 users in its first year from Chile’s 1.2 million household market. Kawas reported a 40% conversion rate from free to paid users. The CEO highlighted DomestikCo’s impact on labor formalization: “Over 40% of workers registered on our platform lacked formal contracts before joining.” Kawas outlined their digital marketing strategy, which includes investments in Meta and Google Ads, content marketing, SEO, free webinars, and active social media presence. On funding, Kawas stated, “We’re currently 100% self-funded, but may seek angel investors, competitive funds, and acceleration programs in the medium term.” The platform streamlines the hiring process, with Kawas noting, “Employers can complete the entire process in less than 5 minutes.” For conflict resolution, Kawas explained, “Our documentation tools prevent misunderstandings, and we have specialist lawyers to advise on fair dispute resolution.” Addressing competition, Kawas said, “We focus on continuous innovation, personalized attention, effective digital marketing, and superior user experience to stay competitive.” Kawas emphasized DomestikCo’s unique position: “While other solutions require separate hiring of lawyers, accountants, and advisors, DomestikCo unifies all these services in an intuitive application.” The CEO acknowledged initial challenges, including resistance to change and adaptation to new technologies. “Through educational campaigns and a special effort to perfect our customer service, we’ve overcome these obstacles,” Kawas explained. Looking ahead, Kawas outlined plans to integrate payment systems, AI-based evaluation tools, and automated legal assistance in the next six months. Long-term, DomestikCo aims to become the leading digital platform for domestic employment management across Latin America.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670

This data-driven approach ensures we meet our customers’ needs effectively.” The company’s role goes beyond the supply of software. Erdmann says, “We are a critical supplier to our customers, not only in terms of enabling branch operations but also for all the analysis of the operations that we do, the analysis of their data, and the delivery of processed data that enables our customers to make much better-quality decisions.” ZeroQ balances growth with profitability.

The company’s marketing strategy combines digital and traditional approaches. Erdmann says: “On the digital side, we focus on performance campaigns on social media and our website, as well as active SEO and SEM initiatives to strengthen our positioning and recognition in the market.” Security and privacy are paramount to ZeroQ. Erdmann proudly notes, “ZeroQ became the first startup in the region to achieve ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certification.” ZeroQ’s IPO experience offers insights for companies aspiring to go public. Erdmann reflects: “The first big lesson was how valuable internal order and control can be from the first day you decide to start a company. After the IPO, ZeroQ faces new challenges. Erdmann acknowledges: “By going public, we are also opening ourselves up to a new type of investor, with a wealth of experience that expects promising results, and we have a commitment and an important mission to demonstrate the value of investing in startups.” Looking ahead, ZeroQ continues to innovate. Erdmann hints, “We will develop solutions enabling our customers to increase their sales, reduce their costs, and improve the quality of care they provide to their customers today.” ZeroQ’s journey from small startup to a publicly traded company offers a model for growth, emphasizing continuous innovation, strategic expansion, talent management, and financial discipline.

Constanza Vera, Loogar’s founder, explains the company’s approach: “We create a unique community of ‘loogareños’ who can buy properties in dream destinations at an accessible cost, with the option to enjoy them or rent them out.” Loogar’s portfolio includes properties in Chilean tourist hotspots like Pucón and Algarrobo, as well as international destinations such as Punta Cana and Tulum. Investment costs start from 3.6 million Chilean pesos, making vacation property ownership more accessible to a broader market. The company’s revenue model is threefold: fraction sales, property management fees, and a 10% commission on rentals facilitated through their platform. Loogar aims for investors to achieve a 10% return on investment, with an average expected return time of 7-8 years. To ensure the security of investments, Loogar purchases properties through mortgage loans and acquires insurance. The company also plans to implement smart locks and other security measures. Additionally, Loogar retains four weeks in each property to facilitate exchanges and address potential conflicts between co-owners. Loogar’s property management service is comprehensive. The company handles furnishing, bill payments, and coordination between co-owners. They’ve established a standardized service with clear rules on property use and scheduling. Maintenance and renovations are managed through the administration service, with inventory checks and renewal plans based on product lifecycles. Technology plays a crucial role in Loogar’s operations. The company is developing a microinvestment management platform for investors and uses an algorithm for property week valuation based on data from Booking and Airbnb. Future plans include incorporating blockchain technology and exploring smart contracts as client understanding of these technologies grows. Loogar’s expansion strategy focuses on high-growth destinations in Latin America. The company is open to investors to accelerate growth and is exploring partnerships with tour operators and restaurants to enhance the “loogareño” experience. Sustainability and community impact are key considerations for Loogar. The company aligns its operations with specific UN Sustainable Development Goals and sources furnishings and decor from local artisans. By increasing property occupancy rates, Loogar aims to promote more sustainable tourism in its chosen destinations. However, Loogar faces challenges, particularly in educating first-time investors about their model. The company currently relies on email marketing and social media to share information about real estate investment and their specific approach. Managing legal and regulatory challenges across different countries is another hurdle, which Loogar addresses by working with specialized law firms. To increase investment liquidity, Loogar is developing a secondary market for fraction resales and plans to offer instant buyback options in the future. While not directly competing with vacation rental platforms like Airbnb, Loogar aims to create a preferred network for members to use their investments for vacations. Looking ahead, Loogar is considering expansion to urban destinations based on vacation potential. The company is also developing algorithms to anticipate market fluctuations and continually testing and adapting its marketing strategies to attract new investors.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670

Challenges in Uruguay included educating hosts and building trust. TripWip overcame this by providing tools and dedicated support for vehicle owners. In Mexico, the company is working on compliance and security integrations to ensure risk-free service. TripWip’s long-term vision aligns with sustainable mobility trends, aiming to increase vehicle access while reducing idle time and urban congestion.

Luis Barrios of Arkangeles on How to invest in crowdfunding to achieve financial freedom,https://contxto.com/en/alternative-investments/luis-barrios-of-arkangeles-on-how-to-invest-in-crowdfunding-to-achieve-financial-freedom/,"Fri, 12 Jul 2024 09:10:17 +0000","We interviewed Luis Barrios from the Crowdfunding platform Arkangeles, to learn how young investors can leverage investing in startups as a better path to gain financial freedom, when compared to classical investment tools. What’s the recommended minimum investment for young investors entering the startup crowdfunding space? Startup crowdfunding platforms have democratized investing, allowing young investors to participate with as little as $280 USD. This accessibility enables diversification and engagement with emerging companies without significant capital outlay. For instance, a tech-savvy investor interested in fintech could allocate this amount to a startup developing innovative financial solutions. By investing small amounts across various startups, they can build a diverse portfolio, learn about different sectors and business models, and potentially become a formidable investor over time. *Note: On Arkangeles, the minimum investment is 5,000 MXN (approximately $280 USD) What percentage of savings or monthly income should young investors allocate to startup investments? A prudent approach for young investors is to limit startup investments to 5-10% of their savings or monthly income. This strategy maintains a healthy balance in personal finances while managing exposure to high-risk investments. For example, if a young professional earns $1,000 monthly, they might consider allocating $50-$100 to startup investments. This approach allows participation in high-growth potential ventures without compromising financial stability. Regular, small investments can leverage compound interest and build a diversified portfolio over time. What are the primary risks young investors should consider when investing in startups? Startup investments carry significant risks that young investors must carefully consider: High failure rate: Statistically, about 90% of startups fail, potentially resulting in a total loss of invested capital. Illiquidity: Startup investments are typically illiquid, often requiring years before any returns materialize, if at all. Market and operational risks: Startups operate in highly competitive and rapidly changing environments, facing numerous challenges in scaling their operations and capturing market share. For instance, a young investor backing a digital health startup should consider potential regulatory hurdles, technological challenges, and market adoption barriers that could impact the company’s long-term viability and success. How can young investors conduct effective due diligence on a startup, especially if they have limited business experience? Effective due diligence is crucial for minimizing risks and making informed investment decisions. Young investors can follow these steps: Thoroughly research the founding team: Evaluate their experience, background, and ability to execute the business plan. Do the founders have a proven track record of success in their respective fields? Analyze the target market: Understand the market size, entry barriers, and competition. Does the startup offer a unique solution to a real market problem? Review the business model and financial projections: Assess the sustainability of the model and the realism of the projections. Does the startup have a clear plan for revenue generation and scaling? Utilize educational resources and tools provided by platforms like Arkangeles, which offer guides and support throughout the investment process. Participate in webinars, online courses, and seek mentorship to gain valuable insights and knowledge. What skills or knowledge are essential for young investors to develop before investing in startups? Key skills for young startup investors include: Financial analysis: Understanding financial statements, evaluating startup viability, and projecting future growth. Business model comprehension: Assessing how a startup plans to generate revenue and scale. Is it B2B, B2C, or a hybrid? What’s its value proposition and competitive advantage? Risk assessment: Identifying and mitigating potential market, operational, and financial challenges a startup may face. To develop these skills, young investors can take finance and entrepreneurship courses, read books on startup investing, and participate in investor communities. What’s the typical time horizon young investors should expect before seeing significant returns on startup investments? Startup investments are generally long-term, with investors typically waiting 7-10 years before seeing significant returns. This timeline reflects the stages startups go through: Product development and testing Market launch Gaining traction and establishing a solid customer base Generating substantial revenue For example, a tech startup might spend several years developing and testing its product before commercial launch. Post-launch, it may need more time to gain market traction and establish a solid customer base. Only after these stages might the startup generate significant revenues and potentially offer returns to investors. Young investors must cultivate patience and a long-term perspective, understanding that successful startups can offer attractive returns but require time and resilience. How can young investors balance a portfolio that includes startup investments with more traditional forms of investment? Balancing a portfolio is crucial for risk management and optimizing returns. Young investors should consider: Allocating only a small percentage (5-10%) of their portfolio to startup investments. Distributing the remainder across safer, more liquid investments like bonds, stocks, and mutual funds. Investing in index funds or ETFs for automatic diversification and risk reduction. Maintaining a balance that allows participation in high-growth potential startups while protecting capital with more stable investments. This strategy enables investors to tap into the high-growth potential of startups while safeguarding their overall financial health. What trends or sectors in the Latin American startup ecosystem appear most promising for the next 5-10 years? Several sectors in Latin America’s startup ecosystem show significant promise: Fintech: Rapid growth driven by the need for innovative financial solutions in a region with limited access to traditional banking services. Healthtech: Increasing demand for digital health solutions and telemedicine, particularly post-pandemic. Edtech: Transforming education through online learning platforms and digital educational tools, addressing educational gaps in the region. Agtech: Leveraging technology to improve efficiency and sustainability in agriculture, a crucial sector for many Latin American economies. Clean technologies: Gaining momentum as the region faces environmental challenges, with startups offering solutions in renewable energy, waste management, and energy efficiency. These sectors are attracting significant investment and are well-positioned to address pressing regional needs while offering substantial growth potential. How does Arkangeles evaluate startups before including them on its platform, and how does this benefit young investors? Arkangeles employs a rigorous evaluation process before listing startups, providing an additional layer of security and confidence for young investors. This process includes: Founding team assessment: Evaluating experience, skills, and ability to execute the business plan. Target market analysis: Determining market size, entry barriers, and growth potential. Business model review: Ensuring sustainability and scalability. Financial metric evaluation: Assessing key metrics to determine the startup’s health and viability. This thorough due diligence process benefits young investors by filtering out high-risk, low-potential startups, allowing them to focus on more promising investment opportunities. What information or resources does Arkangeles provide to educate young investors about the startup investment process? Arkangeles offers a range of educational tools to empower young investors: Detailed guides on startup investment basics, due diligence processes, and diversification strategies. Webinars and online courses covering financial analysis, risk assessment, investment strategies, and market trends. Access to an active investor community for networking, experience sharing, and advice. These resources allow young investors to learn at their own pace, apply knowledge practically, and develop confidence in their investment decisions. How can young investors emotionally manage the volatility and high risk associated with startup investments? Managing the emotional aspects of high-risk startup investments is crucial for long-term success. Young investors can adopt several strategies: Diversification: Spread investments across multiple startups and asset classes to mitigate risk and reduce dependence on any single investment. Long-term perspective: Focus on the long-term investment horizon to avoid impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. Continuous education: Understand the investment process and startup dynamics to better prepare for uncertainties. Community engagement: Participate in investor communities and seek mentorship for emotional support and practical advice. These strategies can help maintain calm and focus in the face of market volatility. What role does networking play in successful startup investments, and how can young investors develop these connections? Networking is crucial for startup investment success, providing access to investment opportunities, expert advice, and support. Young investors can develop connections by: Attending networking events, both online and in-person, to meet other investors, entrepreneurs, and industry professionals. Joining online investment communities and interest groups on platforms like LinkedIn. Seeking experienced mentors in the startup investment field. Actively participating in discussions, sharing knowledge, and offering support to build a positive reputation within the community. For example, a young investor might attend a local angel investor meetup, connect with a fintech-experienced mentor, and gain valuable insights into evaluating startups in this sector. How does startup investment through crowdfunding compare to other alternative investments popular among young people, like cryptocurrencies? Startup crowdfunding and cryptocurrency investments differ significantly: Startup Investments: Support emerging companies with potential for high long-term returns Illiquid, requiring a long-term commitment Opportunity for social and economic impact More stable than cryptocurrencies, but still high-risk Cryptocurrencies: Highly volatile and speculative digital assets Potential for rapid gains or losses More liquid than startup investments Limited tangible impact beyond financial returns Young investors might consider allocating a portion of their portfolio to sustainable tech startups for long-term returns and positive impact, while dedicating a smaller portion to cryptocurrencies for potential rapid growth and liquidity. What advice would you give to a young person wanting to invest in startups but living in a country with restrictive crowdfunding regulations? For young investors in countries with restrictive crowdfunding regulations: Research local laws and regulations thoroughly to understand permissible investment avenues. Explore international crowdfunding platforms registered to operate in multiple countries. Consider investing through venture capital funds or investment funds that offer startup exposure while complying with local regulations. Investigate platforms like Arkangeles that allow international investor participation. By diversifying across international funds and startups, investors can tap into global startup growth while adhering to local regulations. How do you see the future of startup crowdfunding in Latin America, and what changes or evolutions do you anticipate in the coming years that may affect young investors? The future of startup crowdfunding in Latin America is promising, with several anticipated changes: Increased regulation and professionalization, enhancing investor protection and market transparency. Continued technological innovation in investment platforms, improving accessibility and security. Greater diversity in sectors and startups seeking crowdfunding, with emerging opportunities in AI, robotics, and other cutting-edge fields. Growing focus on startups addressing local challenges in Latin America. Young investors should stay attuned to these trends and leverage new technological platforms to capitalize on the region’s crowdfunding growth. What strategies do you recommend for young investors to stay informed about the progress and performance of the startups they’ve invested in? To stay informed about startup investments: Subscribe to startup newsletters for regular updates on milestones, challenges, and future plans. Utilize investment platforms offering periodic reports and analyses on startup performance. Participate in webinars and events organized by startups or investment platforms. Join investor communities and online forums to share experiences and insights. These strategies allow young investors to monitor their investments effectively and make data-driven decisions. How can young investors leverage their unique generational perspective when evaluating startups and emerging trends? Young investors can capitalize on their generational insights by: Identifying startups developing solutions relevant to their generation, particularly in tech and consumer sectors. Evaluating market potential for products and services targeting their demographic. Leveraging their understanding of social media and digital platforms to assess startup traction and reach. Utilizing their networks and online communities to gather feedback and validate investment ideas. This perspective can provide valuable insights into emerging trends and potential market disruptors. What role does impact investing play in startup crowdfunding, and how can young investors align their investments with social or environmental causes they care about? Impact investing is increasingly significant in startup crowdfunding, allowing alignment of investments with personal values. Young investors can: Identify startups with clear missions to address social or environmental issues. Use crowdfunding platforms that highlight impact-focused startups. Participate in impact investing networks and communities. Establish clear criteria for impact investments, ensuring startups prioritize social and environmental well-being alongside financial returns. This approach allows young investors to contribute to meaningful causes while seeking financial returns. How does the liquidity of startup investments through crowdfunding compare to other forms of investment, and what should young investors consider? Startup investments through crowdfunding are generally less liquid than stocks, bonds, or cryptocurrencies. Young investors should consider: The long-term nature of startup investments, often requiring years before potential returns. Limited secondary markets for selling startup shares. The importance of maintaining a balanced portfolio with more liquid assets. Emerging secondary markets on some crowdfunding platforms, though these are still developing. A balanced approach might involve keeping the majority of a portfolio in more liquid assets while allocating a smaller portion to startup investments. What advice would you give to young investors for building a valuable network within the startup ecosystem, even if they don’t live in major urban centers? To build a valuable startup ecosystem network: Leverage online networking opportunities through virtual events, webinars, and discussion groups. Join investor associations and networks, often with local chapters or online groups. Seek mentorship from experienced investors. Attend industry conferences and events, even virtually. Be proactive in offering value to the community by sharing knowledge and helping others. These strategies can help young investors build relevant connections and opportunities, regardless of their location.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670

Information about these customers is sparse and disaggregated, preventing them from accessing key financial products, such as loans. Moffin’s data integration platform can help financial institutions increasingly adopt data-driven decision-making processes, allowing them to access and use external data seamlessly. We foresee a future where Moffin will be a critical infrastructure layer for financial services companies in Mexico, enabling them to better design products for their customers.” Amee Parbhoo, Managing Partner of Accion Venture Lab, for her inclusion in today’s news about Moffin’s funding round.

The proposal of a platform that simplifies the integration of information sources to assess client risk profiles struck us as an innovative approach to this challenge, especially in Latin America.” Moffin plans to use this investment to enhance the capabilities of its platform, particularly in automating monitoring, compliance, data analytics and regulatory tasks.

The company, which offers coaching and consulting for educational and online businesses, has worked with more than 500 companies since its founding. María Rodríguez, CEO and co-founder of Start Lab, shares the company’s vision: “We are not only going to offer a SaaS. We’re going to provide support with coaching and mentoring to make sure the implementation is done correctly to capture customers that are profitable.” The Start Lab story began in 2007 in Caracas, Venezuela, where Rodriguez met Raquel Roman. In 2019, together with José Manuel Rodríguez, they founded Start Lab in Chile. The company focuses on helping scale businesses in the educational and consultative online sphere. The new SaaS will integrate sales funnels, landing pages, email and WhatsApp campaigns, and calendars. Román indicates that this tool will enable companies to save costs and simplify commercial management. José Manuel Rodríguez adds, “Companies will have access to weekly mentoring with a Start Lab expert to review their entire sales system and provide feedback to improve results.” Start Lab plans to expand internationally. Rodriguez elaborates, “Our plan is still Chile, but we want to expand beyond all of Mexico and into the U.S. Hispanic world.” The company has already held events in Mexico City and Miami, with plans for Monterrey, Guadalajara, Houston and Austin. In terms of success metrics, Start Lab focuses on user acquisition cost and customer retention. Rodriguez explains, “The first KPI we want to have is how much it costs us to acquire a SaaS user.” The goal is to achieve an ROI of between 3 to 5 points in the Lifetime Value of a customer in 6 months to 1 year. Start Lab has worked with companies in Chile, Mexico, Spain, Colombia, Costa Rica and Peru. They focus mainly on businesses that generate between US$100 thousand and US$500 thousand per year, offering programs such as “Master in six figures” and “Master in 7 figures”. The company reports monthly sales of around US$ 268 thousand and expects to bill close to US$ 3 million by the end of this year. Despite this growth, Rodriguez says, “We have no need to raise capital at the moment.” Start Lab will initially launch its SaaS organically. “We’re going to first offer it to our current database,” Rodriguez explains. They plan to open between 20 and 50 slots for early adopters, offering a 30-day free trial. Start Lab’s long-term vision is ambitious.

Romero and Grundy detail BucksApp’s strategy after raising $1 million.,https://contxto.com/en/paraguay/romero-y-grundy-detallan-estrategia-de-bucksapp-tras-recaudar-1-millon/,"Tue, 09 Jul 2024 11:15:59 +0000","BucksApp, an B2B fintech startup founded in Paraguay and Bolivia, has successfully secured $1 million in a pre-seed funding round, marking a significant milestone in its journey. The company specializes in providing data-based solutions for a wide range of clients, including financial institutions such as banks, digital wallets, and card processors, as well as non-financial entities like retailers, supermarkets, and pharmacies. Their primary mission is to help these clients maximize their revenue through comprehensive and detailed analysis that provides a better understanding of transactional data to drive sales. Funding and Investor Support The funding round was led by iThink VC and BuenTrip Ventures, with additional contributions from Escalatec and angel investors. This financial backing not only underscores confidence in BucksApp’s business model but also marks an important milestone: BucksApp becomes the first Paraguayan startup backed by three regional venture capital firms from Paraguay, Bolivia, and Ecuador. Jazmín Gustale, General Partner at iThink VC, expressed confidence in BucksApp’s founding team, highlighting their combination of industry experience and geographical knowledge of the markets in which they operate. Carmen De La Cerda, Managing Partner at BuenTrip Ventures, emphasized BucksApp’s role in building a key infrastructure component within their target markets. Viviana Coloma, Fund Manager at Escalatec, highlighted BucksApp’s potential to transform how institutions leverage their data to drive sales in Latin America. Leadership and Vision BucksApp is led by CEO Sebastián Romero and CFO Lorena Grundy, originally from Paraguay and Bolivia respectively. This management team combines solid experience in the financial sector, technological development, and startup growth. Their collective vision and passion for financial inclusion and technological advancement uniquely position BucksApp for success in its ambitious expansion across Latin America. Sebastián Romero, CEO, shared: “With this funding round, we are prepared to take significant steps in Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador, further developing our technology and expanding our team. Our mission is to help our clients revolutionize the way they understand their customers’ transactional behavior to drive sales.” Technology and Services BucksApp’s value proposition centers on its ability to transform large amounts of data, often duplicated and incomplete, into useful information for decision-making that drives revenue. For example, they can help a bank launch a discount associated with one of its cards for a specific audience at a specific merchant, or help a supermarket create personalized promotions for slow-moving products based on customer consumption patterns. BucksApp’s advanced technology allows it to connect to its clients’ databases in real-time, consuming all types of transactional data, from card transactions and QR payments to transfers and cash operations. This data is processed through their proprietary algorithm based on artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify opportunities to generate higher sales. The results can be visualized in tables, graphs, websites, or mobile applications through internal APIs and SDKs. Lorena Grundy, CFO, adds: “We are building our solution in the most ‘plug and play’ and automated way possible, from data consumption to reporting and purchase/sale recommendations. This way we can target various customer segments such as banks, retailers, pharmacies, and digital wallets in different countries.” Data Security and Privacy In a world where data security is paramount, BucksApp has implemented robust protection measures. Romero explains: “At BucksApp, we work with anonymous data and encrypted information. This means that the data we receive from our clients is encoded so that only the client can know the identity of their users.” The company uses Google Cloud servers, which provide a private and encrypted network. “Data travels in encrypted format in data centers that offer multiple levels of security and isolation and have configurations that limit access,” adds Romero. Market Potential and Expansion Strategy The market potential in BucksApp’s target countries – Paraguay, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru – is considerable. In these countries, there are nearly 20,000 potential client entities, including banks, digital wallets, processors, cooperatives, smaller financial institutions, retailers, supermarkets, and pharmacies. With an average annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $40K per client, the total addressable market (TAM) approaches $1B in annual recurring revenue. Grundy details the expansion strategy: “We have an orderly growth strategy to enter new markets. We firmly believe in the power of networking and contact networks, which allow us to reach the right people within potential client companies. Additionally, it’s fundamental for us to show our clients the value we can add to their businesses, which we do through proof of concepts where they can tangibly see our solutions and their benefits.” Achievements and Current Clients In the last 15 months, BucksApp has made significant progress. They have developed and launched their first MVP (Minimum Viable Product) tested with initial clients, and have expanded their team in Paraguay and Bolivia. The company has signed contracts with three banks, one processor, and two retailers, impacting more than 300,000 customers and processing over 20 million transactions. Romero mentions: “As of today, 100% of our revenue comes from recurring clients. It’s worth noting that we have 3 pending contracts to sign with new clients.” Additionally, BucksApp is in the pilot phase in Bolivia and has Peru as its next target market. Competitive Advantage and Pricing Model BucksApp’s competitive advantage lies in its ability to offer a quick, efficient, and economical solution compared to the internal development of similar solutions by companies. Grundy highlights: “Our clients, in part, are starting to clean and analyze their data. However, for them to do it efficiently, it would cost them hundreds or thousands of dollars as they sit on legacy infrastructures. At BucksApp, we offer a safer, more accurate, and faster way to collect, clean, and analyze all types of transactional data to find opportunities to generate higher revenues.” Regarding the pricing model, Romero details: “Our business model has two components, the first is a one-time integration fee, and the second is the monthly fee that is based on the volume of data processed for each client.” He adds that they differentiate themselves “by having an accessible price structure.” Client Retention and Success Metrics BucksApp has achieved an impressive client retention rate. Romero notes: “To date, our retention rate has been close to 100%, our clients feel the value we generate for them and a bond is created where BucksApp is more than a provider, it’s a strategic ally.” Grundy lists some key metrics they use to measure success: “Sessions initiated, session duration, in the case of financial sector clients: percentage of budget compliance of their users (personal finance functionalities). For non-financial sector clients: number of clicks on personalized campaigns/promotions, percentage increase in sales of promoted products.” Regulatory Challenges and Implementation Time Regarding regulatory challenges, Grundy explains: “Among the sectors we work with, the one with the most rigorous regulation is the financial sector. As we are a service provider, we are not subject to this regulation, however, as strategic allies of our clients, BucksApp accompanies them throughout the entire process necessary to obtain any type of authorization, permit, or no objection from the regulatory body.” Regarding implementation time, Romero indicates: “Once the contract is signed, implementation can take between 1-3 months, depending on the level of service required by the client.” He adds: “We have proven to be faster in integration. A bank normally takes more than 12 months to integrate with technology providers, we have done it in 6 months.” Future Plans and Long-term Vision BucksApp has ambitious growth plans. Romero establishes the short-term profitability goal: “We want to achieve profitability in the next 6 months by closing with 10 clients with monthly tickets of $1k to $2k.” Regarding service diversification, Grundy adds: “Our strategy is to start with this data and sales-oriented solution and then offer more products and do ‘up-selling’. Predictive analysis is something we are working closely on as an example.” Finally, Grundy shares the long-term vision: “The idea is to start in Paraguay, Bolivia, and Peru and then go to the rest of Latin America. Once we have an interesting footprint, get on the radar of a potential buyer, be it a bank, processor, or credit agency. We have seen that this path worked very well for larger competitors in Europe.” With its innovative technology, experienced team, and backing from major investors, BucksApp is well-positioned to transform the way companies in Latin America use their data to drive sales, with a clear focus on regional expansion and continuous technology development.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
What Latam did in the shadows of Softbank and Tiger Global’s retreat,https://contxto.com/en/venture-capital/what-latam-did-in-the-shadows-of-softbank-and-tiger-globals-retreat/,"Tue, 02 Jul 2024 15:39:41 +0000","At first, it caused a minor shockwave in the ecosystem. Latin American startups were fearful at the thought that major investors in the region like SoftBank and Tiger Global were retreating due to an internal strategy to withdraw from certain markets. However, what appeared to be a setback at first soon became a powerful force that has been reshaping the region’s ecosystem ever since, with many new VCs filling in the space these big players left. Latam countries were able to leverage the retreat of SoftBank and Tiger Global to unveil a series of opportunities – and lessons – for both local and international funds that before didn’t stand a chance. With the influx of foreign capital diminishing, the spotlight shifted to native investors. As access to capital becomes scarce, entrepreneurs are forced to innovate with sustainability in mind, adopting bootstrapping practices and more risk-averse growth strategies. A retreat of risk capital means more competition for the small pools, and taking into consideration the complex macroeconomic environment, the few investors willing to allocate risk capital are requesting huge risk premiums for their money. I remain bullish in the Latam innovation ecosystem. Let us point five areas where I believe Latam is leading the way after the retreat of the big VC players: Strong understanding of their ecosystem, the diversification of funding sources, the emergence of local talent, strengthened regional collaboration and mentorship beyond capital. The local VC factor Venture capitalists in Latin America had been largely overshadowed by foreign VC actors over the last few years. But now they are becoming central players. With their on-the-ground presence, local VCs are uniquely positioned to conduct comprehensive evaluations and due diligence that better align with the needs and realities of their local ecosystem. It’s that much harder to hoodwink a local VC that has extensive insight on what business people talk about behind closed doors, and a vast network of connections to vet you with. This proximity is also enabling a more prudent investment approach, fostering sustainable growth by reducing the risks associated with overinflated valuations or misguided ventures. Besides that, local investors know their market and current dynamics, which helps them invest in culturally and socially relevant ventures. They can more easily directly observe operations, meet with founders frequently, provide a value-add through network expansion and understand the local consumer base better. This approach helps prevent the likelihood of bubbles being created, and to resist the powerful attraction of hypes. A more diverse set of investors Local firms, family offices, and regional financial institutions are now more actively participating in funding rounds due to less big player competition, creating a more robust and stable investment ecosystem. This is fostering a healthier, competitive environment. It reduces the risk associated with over-reliance on any dominant investment channel, which could mitigate the impact of any single investor’s withdrawal in the future. Startups are also benefiting from the diversification of funding sources. This shift has opened up access to capital, making it easier for a wider range of startups to secure the financial backing they need. Local talent is having its moment Local firms leading the way also means a renewed focus on nurturing local talent and fostering innovation that addresses the region’s unique challenges and critical social issues. The talent was there waiting to be put to work, as others have highlighted the highly skilled workforce of the region, as opposed to the usual preconceptions. Local investors are more driven to identify ventures that have a tangible impact on their communities. They tend to have more awareness of the specific needs of their ecosystems. That means they know who to partner with to develop solutions that are tailored to the market conditions and consumer demands. From fintech solutions that improve financial inclusion to agritech innovations that boost agricultural productivity, this is a unique time for local investors to partner with local talent to move the needle on crucial issues. Strength in numbers Stronger regional collaboration is a key component driving Latam’s innovation machine. Local firms are increasingly building networks and partnerships across Latin America, enhancing the overall ecosystem’s connectivity and support structures. These collaborations express optimism on the future of the region. are crucial for sharing knowledge, resources, and best practices across borders in a way that may lead to more cohesive technological progress, and help weather business volatility and economic fluctuations. The ultimate goal should be to create shared resources, such as incubators and accelerators, and to advocate for smart policies that support innovation and entrepreneurship while also expanding their footprint outside of their local ecosystems. Beyond capital Local firms have proved to be not only reliable investors but also mentors and strategic partners. Because they have a shared culture, they are better equipped to nurture the VC-founder relationship. Global investors sometimes lack a deep understanding of the region’s intricacies, while local ones can offer experienced advice on business development, market expansion, and navigating regulatory landscapes. But not everything is about business guidance. Local investors also bring to the table an extensive network of regional connections. These factors can help startups thrive not only nationally but internationally. It’s clear that the withdrawal of SoftBank and Tiger Global from Latin America, while initially challenging, has ultimately catalyzed a transformation in the regional investment landscape. As Latin America navigates this new era, the lessons learned from the transition will undoubtedly pave the way for a more robust and independent future. —by Héctor Jirau, CEO, Parrallel18",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Maximiliano Militzer on why FlameSense Developed a Forest Fire Prevention System,https://contxto.com/en/chile/maximiliano-militzer-on-why-flamesense-developed-a-forest-fire-prevention-system/,"Tue, 02 Jul 2024 14:01:44 +0000","Chilean startup FlameSense has developed an AI-powered system to prevent forest fires. In a recent interview with Contxto, founder Maximiliano Militzer shared insights into their approach and plans. “Our technology detects and tracks people, providing evidence for potential legal action before fires start,” Militzer explained. The system uses placed ‘pods’ with 360-degree cameras and sensors to detect potential fire risks. Militzer created FlameSense in response to Chile’s forest fire vulnerability. He stated, “Over the past decade, 1.7 million hectares have burned – triple the amount from the previous decade. With over 60% of fires being human-caused and 40% intentional, we focus on early detection and prevention.” Regarding recent events, Militzer said, “If FlameSense had been installed in Valparaíso, we would have detected the two individuals who started the recent fire.” The founder shared results from their pilot projects. In San Francisco de Mostazal, the system alerted property owners to a small fire, which was extinguished before spreading. “A second pilot recently launched in Pichilemu,” Militzer added. On the company’s development, Militzer said, “It began in my dorm room with an Arduino board and initial code. With a $50,000 investment from our angel investor and now co-founder Samuel Lira, we developed our hardware.” Militzer explained their business model: “We charge an initial installation fee and annual fees for maintenance and updates.” He projects protecting 10,000 hectares this fire season, with potential annual revenue of $510,000 from current pilots. For future plans, Militzer stated: “We aim to expand internationally, targeting protection of 10% of Latin America’s forests within a few years. Our system’s AI adapts to different climate conditions.” Militzer emphasized their timeline, stating, “We have until 2030 to address this problem.” FlameSense’s approach combines AI, hardware placement, and rapid response capabilities to tackle forest fire prevention.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670

Israel Grintz Discusses Terrific’s Market Strategy and Future Vision,https://contxto.com/en/e-commerce/israel-grintz-discusses-terrifics-market-strategy-and-future-vision/,"Mon, 01 Jul 2024 07:55:37 +0000","Terrific, a white-label social shopping platform, has recently expanded its operations in Latin America. The company provides a live shopping tool that integrates with existing platforms of brands, marketplaces, and retailers. Terrific has partnered with several companies in the region, including Sears México, and has worked with brands such as Kappa, Levi’s, Puma, LG, Sansui, Samsung, Chicco, and América. The platform aims to combine real-time interaction, personalized recommendations, and dynamic content to enhance the customer shopping experience. According to Terrific, their technology has helped some clients improve conversion rates and customer engagement. Israel Grintz, Founder and CEO of Terrific, notes that the Latin American audience has shown a strong affinity for social commerce and has been quick to adopt new technologies in this space. The company is now inviting more brands, sports groups, marketplaces, and content distribution companies across Latin America to use their platform. This expansion comes as social commerce continues to grow in importance in the e-commerce landscape, particularly in Latin America. A Quick conversation with Israel Grintz Mr. Grintz, Terrific has been expanding rapidly in Latin America. How do you distinguish between a passing trend and a real market opportunity in social commerce? Social commerce is a natural extension of human behavior. We’re tribal creatures who enjoy doing things together. To ensure we’re building something for the long haul, we look for consistent patterns in user behavior and market demand over time. We rely on data analytics to identify these patterns and validate market opportunities through pilot programs and continuous feedback from our users. Trends are often short-lived and heavily driven by hype, while true opportunities show sustained growth and align with fundamental human needs. Your press release mentions collaborations with various brands. What specific cultural challenges have you faced when adapting your business model to different Latin American countries? Each country has its unique culture, consumer behavior, and economic conditions. We tailor our approach by understanding local preferences, regulatory environments, and partnering with local experts to ensure our solutions resonate with each market. For instance, in some regions, there’s a higher reliance on mobile commerce, which we’ve adapted our platform to support seamlessly. How does Latin American consumer behavior in social shopping differ from other regions in the world? Latin American consumers are highly engaged on social media and value interactive and community-driven shopping experiences. They often seek recommendations from influencers and peers, making live shopping events particularly effective. Additionally, there’s a strong preference for localized content and payment methods. The incredible affinity between the Latin audience and social commerce is undeniable. This audience has consistently been among the earliest adopters of new technologies and has shown the fastest growth in social media engagement for years. Privacy is a growing concern in the digital age. How do you manage the tension between personalization and privacy on your platform? We prioritize user consent and transparency. Our platform uses anonymized data to personalize experiences while ensuring strict compliance with privacy regulations. We continually update our practices to align with evolving standards and help our clients maintain ownership and control of their data. What has been the most significant pivot in Terrific’s strategy since its founding? Initially, we focused solely on live shopping. However, we expanded to include shoppable videos and comprehensive analytics, driven by customer demand for more integrated solutions that provide deeper insights into consumer behavior. This pivot was motivated by the need to offer a more holistic approach to social commerce. Additionally, our partnership in Latin America has been a game-changer, giving us a significant boost in the local market and connecting us with key players in the region. The e-commerce landscape is constantly evolving. How are you preparing for a possible saturation of the social commerce market in Latin America? We invest in continuous innovation and differentiation. By offering unique features like real-time data insights and AI-driven recommendations, we stay ahead of competitors. We also explore new markets and partnerships to expand our reach, ensuring we remain relevant and valuable to our clients. Can you share a specific success story with a brand that significantly exceeded expectations? Certainly. One brand saw over 40% conversion for customers who had abandoned their carts during a live shopping event. We helped shorten the decision-making time by providing real-time engagement and personalized offers. Another case saw a brand achieve a 200% increase in sales by leveraging influencer partnerships and creating highly engaging, interactive content. Looking ahead, how do you envision Terrific in five years, and what steps are you taking to achieve that vision? In five years, we aim to be the leading decentralized platform supporting e-commerce, social, and content companies globally. We want to be the building blocks and pipelines of the social commerce world. Today, we’re investing in AI, expanding our market presence, and continuously improving our platform. We also ensure we protect customer privacy and help our clients retain full ownership of their data. Additionally, our amazing partner in Latin America has provided us with a significant boost in the local market, helping us connect with key players and accelerate our growth in the region.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
Impacta VC’s Catalina Taricco on Backing Retorna,https://contxto.com/en/venture-capital/impacta-vcs-catalina-taricco-on-backing-retorna/,"Fri, 28 Jun 2024 09:02:13 +0000","In a significant development for Latin America’s fintech sector, Impacta VC has announced its largest investment to date in Retorna, a startup poised to transform the remittance industry. This underscores the growing importance of innovative financial solutions in the region and highlights the potential for technology to address critical social and economic challenges. Catalina Taricco Catalina Taricco, COO & CMO of Impacta VC, shared insights into the decision-making process behind this investment. “Retorna reached a very good company level with operations sustained 100% by bootstrapping before raising this round,” Taricco explained. “This already demonstrated their great ability to build the company and solve the problem they set out to address.” The investment was influenced by several key factors, including Retorna’s multidisciplinary team, the vast market size they’re addressing, and their potential for global scalability. However, what truly sets Retorna apart is its founders’ personal connection to the problem they’re solving. As Taricco noted, “Their main differentiation is that all their founders are the primary users of the problem they solve, that is, they manage it from a personal need as migrants, which generates an unstoppable force and motivation.” This personal understanding translates into a service that not only processes remittances faster but also reaches more remote locations, expanding financial access to underserved areas. Perhaps most notably, Retorna offers 24/7 customer service with human representatives. “They have 24/7 customer service attended by humans that provides quick solutions to their customers, adjusting to each case, with the flexibility and focus that their users need. That is worth gold today,” Taricco emphasized. “Our goal [at Retorna] is to grow the user base to gain dominance in the markets where we operate.” Atilana Piñón, Retorna’s co-founder and CEO Despite the complex regulatory landscape of the remittance industry in Latin America, Retorna is making swift progress. The company is currently opening five new routes every two to three weeks, navigating the regulatory requirements of different countries with apparent ease. This rapid expansion is a testament to both Retorna’s agile technology and its team’s ability to navigate complex regulatory environments. Atilana Piñón, co-founder and CEO of Retorna, outlined the company’s growth strategy: “Our goal is to grow the user base to gain dominance in the markets where we operate.” This aligns with Impacta VC’s expectations for the company. As Taricco shared, “We hope they will take their company to the next level, taking a larger market share in an industry that in Latin America alone moves US$160 million.” Impacta VC’s involvement goes beyond mere capital injection. The firm plans to support Retorna with knowledge and connections, helping the startup navigate its growth journey. “Our goal is to help with capital, knowledge and connections,” Taricco explained. “This goes far beyond just depositing a check for them, what interests us is to accompany them on their growth path and add continuous value.” In the short term, Impacta VC will assist Retorna in designing and executing its Series A strategy, aiming to help the company secure its next funding round. The VC firm also plans to support Retorna’s market penetration efforts and the opening of new routes. This investment aligns closely with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 10.2, which focuses on reducing inequalities and promoting social, economic, and political inclusion. By providing a more efficient and accessible remittance service, Retorna is helping millions of migrants worldwide integrate financially and overcome one of the major challenges of leaving their home countries. Impacta VC’s investment in Retorna reflects a growing trend in venture capital: the alignment of financial returns with social impact. As Taricco states, “For investors, the greater the impact, the more valuable the company will be. It is a whole that works in parallel, there is no social impact if there are no operations and financial returns.” In the competitive fintech landscape, Retorna’s success will likely depend on its ability to maintain its unique value proposition while scaling operations. Taricco highlighted the unique dynamics of the sector: “As Atilana said, in this industry there is the ‘frenemy’, a combination of the words ‘friend’ and ‘enemy’, where they ‘fight’ with the competition for customers, but there is also a collaborative environment in terms of platforms, learning from each other’s mistakes and successes.” As Retorna continues to expand and refine its services, it stands as an example of how technology can address critical social needs while building a successful business. For Latin America’s tech ecosystem, this investment signals the potential for homegrown solutions to solve regional and global challenges, paving the way for more impactful startups in the future.",,2025-04-11T20:05:17.320670
The Investment Security Bond Scam: How Desperate Founders Are Being Targeted in LATAM’s VC Winter,https://latamlist.com/the-investment-security-bond-scam/,"Thu, 10 Apr 2025 15:34:43 +0000","As we approach the third anniversary of the 2022 venture capital peak, Latin American founders are navigating one of the most challenging fundraising environments in recent history. This scarcity has created fertile ground for sophisticated investment scams targeting vulnerable entrepreneurs. A particularly insidious scheme known as the “Investment Security Bond” (ISB) scam is spreading rapidly throughout the region, ensnaring founders desperate to secure funding before their runway expires. The Current State of LatAm Venture Capital The Latin American venture capital landscape has experienced significant contraction since its 2021 peak of $16 billion. Total investment reached just $3.6 billion in 2024, marking one of the lowest levels in five years. This represents a dramatic reduction from the pandemic-era funding boom. While Q4 2024 showed positive momentum with $1.23 billion in funding (the highest quarterly volume in over two years), the overall environment remains challenging These conditions have created perfect hunting grounds for scammers who recognize that many founders in Latin America are running dangerously low on cash and increasingly desperate to close deals. How the Investment Security Bond Scam Works The “investment security bond” scam typically follows a predictable pattern designed to exploit founders’ vulnerability and eagerness: The Setup The scheme begins with a message from what appears to be a legitimate international investment fund, often claiming to be based overseas, often in Asia. The firm presents a professional facade with a convincing online presence. They express interest in investing in your startup – typically offering to invest upwards of US$1 million, a lifeline for many cash-strapped companies. The initial communications seem legitimate, and the scammers may even provide a term sheet. Though the terms might seem unusual, many founders rationalize this as cultural or regional differences in investment approaches, and because the term sheet is often governed under the laws of some Asian countries, sometimes founders don’t reach out to their local or US lawyers and negotiate directly. The Trap As investment negotiations progress and the founder becomes emotionally invested in the deal, the scam reveals itself. The investor then notes that “Before releasing funds, the “investors” require the company to purchase an “Investment Security Bond” (ISB) or similarly named insurance product. Here’s an example of how they might phrase it: “The investment committee of our fund Global Capital Partners requires your company to obtain an Investment Security Guarantee (ISG) certificate. This certificate provides insurance coverage to protect our investment against potential losses.” The sophistication of this language can make even experienced entrepreneurs pause and consider complying. After all, what’s a small insurance payment compared to securing US$1 million in funding? The reality? Once the founder wires money for this “insurance policy,” the so-called investors vanish completely. No funding ever materializes. Red Flags to Watch For As venture capital remains scarce in Latin America, founders must be increasingly vigilant. Here are key warning signs that an investment opportunity might be fraudulent: Unsolicited investment offers from unknown entities, particularly those claiming to be based in Asia or far-off lands; Offers that seem too good to be true in terms of valuation or investment amount; Unusual requests for upfront payments of any kind before funding arrives; Term sheets that deviate significantly from standard venture practices; Pressure to move quickly and avoid involving your legal counsel; Professional-looking websites that contain links to legitimate businesses to appear credible; Promises of government protection or guarantees for your investment. How to Protect Yourself and Your Startup The first rule is absolute: legitimate investors will never ask you to send money as a condition to receive funding. Additionally: Always conduct thorough due diligence on potential investors, including verifying their portfolio companies; Leverage your network to validate investor credentials; Consult with experienced legal counsel before signing any investment documents; Take your time – pressure to rush is often a manipulation tactic; When something feels off, trust your instincts and investigate further; Use trusted accelerators and advisors to help vet potential investors. A Safer Path Forward: Meet Grow by PAG Law Recognizing the heightened risks facing Latin American founders in this challenging fundraising environment, PAG Law developed Grow a founder-first platform specifically designed to help entrepreneurs including Latin founders navigate fundraising securely and efficiently. As the Latin American venture ecosystem continues to navigate these challenging times, fraudsters will undoubtedly continue developing sophisticated schemes targeting vulnerable founders. Staying vigilant, leveraging trusted networks, and utilizing platforms like Grow can help protect your startup from becoming the next victim.

Side Letters and SAFEs: What LatAm founders should expect and avoid,https://latamlist.com/side-letters-and-safes-what-latam-founders-should-expect-and-avoid/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 16:23:23 +0000","Simple Agreements for Future Equity (SAFEs) have become a popular funding tool for early-stage startups across Latin America, offering an avenue to raise capital with minimal friction and legal costs. While SAFEs are designed to be simple, many institutional investors request additional protections through a Side Letter. With LatAm companies, investors often push for additional protections that can tilt the playing field. Understanding these nuances is key to avoiding unfavorable terms. Founders must be careful not to allow Side Letters to evolve into full-fledged National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) style agreements, driving up legal fees and signing some of the company’s freedom away. The rights provided to an investor in a Side Letter should be proportional to their check size—those committing more capital or a larger share of a SAFE round may warrant additional protections, but these should remain balanced. Here are a few common Side Letter provisions and some thoughts on how LatAm founders can approach them. Common Side Letter provisions Information and inspection rights – Investors may want financial updates and access to company records. While transparency is important, founders should ensure that reporting obligations are not excessive or disruptive to operations. Startups should avoid the expense of audited financials until they reach significant financial maturity, and confidentiality obligations should bind investors receiving company financial information. Pro rata rights – Investors often seek the right to maintain their ownership percentage in future financing rounds. However, early investor pro rata rights can conflict with later-stage investors, who may want the next financing round occupied only by bigger checks. Founders should limit pro rata rights to investors they see as long-term partners and those who start off with a large-enough investment to guarantee the right to keep investing in the company. Board observer/ future director rights – Some investors want to attend board meetings as non-voting participants or want the right to sit on the company’s board when it is established in the future. In LatAm, it is common for investors to request board rights earlier than in the U.S. Founders should be particularly cautious about giving board seats too early, as it can deter later investors. A reasonable compromise is conditioning a future director seat only upon an additional investment in a future round. Future rights as a major investor – Some investors negotiate to be treated as “Major Investors” once the company completes a priced round. In the NVCA documents commonly used for a priced round, Major Investors usually receive information rights, pro rata rights, rights of first refusal, and tag-along rights with respect to future founder secondary sales, among others. Founders should only provide this future Major Investor treatment to their biggest SAFE investors and, even then, should consider limiting it to investors committing additional capital in the priced round. Most Favored Nation (MFN) Clause – If a future investor negotiates more favorable terms in a SAFE or Side Letter, an existing investor with an MFN clause will be able to receive those more favorable terms. Y Combinator has a version of the SAFE that includes MFN language directly therein. Like the YC language, the MFN should only apply to subsequent convertible securities. Less common (and more problematic) provisions to watch for While many Side Letter requests are reasonable, some provisions can introduce risks and constraints that LatAm founders should be particularly cautious of: Extensive representations and covenants – Some Side Letters attempt to include complex regulatory and other company representations, along with significant covenants that are more common in priced round documentation. If a Side Letter starts resembling a full investment agreement, it may be a red flag that the investor is overreaching. Founders should push back to prevent unnecessary complexity. Investor approval rights – Giving investors veto power over key company actions can slow down decision-making and deter future investors. This is particularly dangerous in LatAm, where regulatory and operational uncertainties already create enough challenges. Conditions to investment – Some Side Letters introduce conditions precedent to funding, such as obtaining third-party approvals or hitting revenue milestones before receiving capital. These conditions can create unnecessary delays and uncertainty in accessing funds. Put options – A put option allows investors to sell their SAFE back to the company under certain conditions, potentially creating future financial strain. This is unusual for early-stage investments and should generally be avoided. Termination Regardless of what a Side Letter provides, one thing should remain true: it should not exist forever. To prevent Side Letters from creating long-term obligations, founders should ensure that all Side Letter provisions terminate under clear conditions, such as: An initial public offering of the company’s securities; A subsequent priced round, at which point investor rights should be formalized under standard agreements; A sale of the company, ensuring Side Letter rights do not interfere with M&A processes. Final Thoughts Side Letters are becoming more common in LatAm startup financings as institutional investors seek added protections. However, founders should remain vigilant. Many investors in the region push for terms that go beyond what is typical in the U.S., sometimes making capital unnecessarily expensive. While Side Letters can help align interests between founders and investors, excessive or overly complex provisions create unnecessary complications. Founders must remember that SAFEs are meant to be simple. LatAm founders should approach Side Letters with a clear understanding of what’s standard, what’s negotiable, and what’s potentially harmful. Pushing back on unreasonable terms is not only possible but essential to maintaining long-term control of your company.
